may we be successful in promoting peace in the world .
i mention this because it wa not quite clear .
how far must the spiral of violence go until sense and reason prevail ?
all people in the middle east have the same worth .
the people in the gaza strip must be given urgent help .
we must not allow a worsening of the humanitarian situation !
a political solution must be reached in the end .
an immediate and permanent ceasefire must come into force .
the third requirement is to intensify the peace process .
in the meantime , we are again in the process of escalation .
international force can and must help to secure a ceasefire .
dialogue and negotiation are the only way out of this crisis .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
it ha been requested that this draft be amended a follows .
that we should discus it here in parliament is perfectly natural .
if this is so , we can support it .
this is an important basic principle and an important statement by parliament .
i believe that a ceasefire alone will not be enough .
we should not destroy this by a resolution perhaps shaped by emotion .
would mr cohn-bendit and mr ferber please stop their argument now .
anything connected with these debate can be addressed in these debate .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
you will , of course , receive an answer on this point .
the various country held very different opinion on this issue .
mr president , i rise on the issue of palestine .
this onslaught is not alone disproportionate ; it is entirely unjustified .
tiptoeing around the israeli administration will not work ; it ha never worked .
israel must now understand that there are indeed consequence for it action .
this is the typical result of political state control over production .
two of our fellow member have already spoken of this .
the negative impact is multiplied exponentially on the fringe of europe and society .
mr president , nowadays we are faced with a paradox .
the lithuanian authority subsequently tried to deprive them of their parliamentary seat .
the reason given is that these person hold the karta polaka .
i trust the lithuanian authority will reflect on the matter .
we must not forget however about another necessity : to save energy .
some analyst even mention a figure of a third of total consumption .
the journey started in slovakia and wa due to end in spain .
- ( c ) happy new year , mr president .
it ha even postponed negotiation with russia over energy security .
i am yet more shocked by the position of the european commission .
or perhaps this wa just a bad new year 's joke ?
madam president , i wish to raise the issue of zimbabwe .
with over 900 now dead , the futility of politics-by-war is painfully evident .
we have to demand an end to the attack on gaza .
- ( c ) thank you , madam president .
such a fight would be both futile and ridiculous .
we have abandoned the scientific principle of risk assessment .
recycling paper ha been much in the news recently .
the current situation in poland in this regard may be summarised a follows .
i therefore appeal for environmentally conscious action to resolve this problem .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
plant protection product are , in fact , medicine for plant .
compliance with the stipulation of the water framework directive is top priority .
there are regulation for checking equipment and regular maintenance interval will be set .
the proposed measure will benefit the environment , consumer and user .
therefore , safety can only be achieved with an outright ban .
this is a compromise to which the council ha already given it approval .
the fact that agreement wa achieved at second reading is particularly gratifying .
clear and strict criterion would be set for the approval of active substance .
it also reflects the lisbon strategy , a it would reduce red tape .
for example , the approval procedure would become shorter and more efficient .
the commission ha just made a declaration on this point .
the front page of the newspaper read 'eu threatens danish groundwater ' .
these are substance that impair the development of child 's brain .
i think that we should have been more ambitious .
this is a victory for health and for the environment .
i must address the very controversial issue of endocrine disrupters .
until now there ha been no definition of these .
there is no doubt that rate of cancer have increased .
we can not and should not legislate in the abstract .
we can not prejudice this scientific assessment with a non-scientific-based definition .
your amendment will bring about exactly the opposite situation .
what the pesticide industry want is that we do not set any criterion .
this is the crux of the matter and nothing else .
otherwise , we have taken all measure to support agriculture a always .
and now to mr klass , many thanks for your work !
i also hope that we have made a little progress towards more transparency .
we should , in fact , be concerned with general interest .
it is difficult to strike a balance between good and bad .
integrated pest programme have already decreased the need for pesticide .
what is important are the option , not quantity .
and you seem to have ignored the benefit of crop rotation .
a ever , a compromise is about give and take .
the union for europe of the nation group support the directive .
there are two compromise between parliament and the council before u .
unfortunately , i believe this pesticide package may fall into the latter category .
collectively , it must be possible for u to be protected against toxicity .
pesticide that have already been approved are not being withdrawn .
i do , in fact , have reservation about that .
we should be very strict when it come to poison of this kind .
people will then choose to buy such a product in particular .
i therefore recommend that the house vote in favour of this excellent compromise .
there would be a risk there of unfair competition .
it is icy out there - that is a hazard .
there is a risk i will fall over when i walk home .
it will make food price higher , particularly in the uk .
exception are allowed where no alternative are yet available .
these are all measure that benefit the environment and public health .
significant financial support is a priority , rather than additional legal provision .
it scope can not be reduced to a simple market-harmonisation or competitiveness problem .
who is giving thought to the current public health problem ?
fungi - unlike insect that come and go - come and stay .
this wa also reflected in the deliberation in parliament .
the result achieved in the trialogue will create the precondition for this .
however , substance that are really hazardous will also be banned .
our debate about chemical are too often conducted on a very irrational level .
we must think and act rationally if we are to achieve sensible result .
otherwise , we will overstretch the precautionary principle here .
i believe that the compromise we hope to agree on are sound .
our farmer will have to pay more for safer pesticide .
these principle were taken into consideration in a balanced manner , overall .
member state will have sufficient room to manoeuvre to implement this accordingly .
however , this is a compromise which should be supported by everybody .
i believe it would be appropriate to regulate this matter at community level .
in my low-lying country , the situation is very specific .
for this reason , this directive pose extremely serious danger .
the question are : will the agrochemical industry respond and produce new product ?
the commission doe not have the answer to that question .
we have done a huge amount of survey on this .
i leave you with one or two last thought on this .
i would rather that it were stipulated that they must do this .
we have needed fungicide to reduce blight and actually grow the potato .
we really do urge you to have a proper impact assessment .
if you drink pure alcohol , we know what happens .
may i say that these are two different issue .
it is not simply a matter of measuring level of residue in food .
we must not permit such unequal term of competition for european farmer .
i am also pleased with the compromise reached on aerial spraying .
i consider the authorisation of plant protection product in a 3-zone system unacceptable .
all this ha been devoured by the medium with great enthusiasm .
tomorrow 's vote in parliament will conclude three year of work .
we do not need to damage production in the process .
only certain category of small distributor will be exempt from this requirement .
the industry will therefore have ample time to develop other safer substance .
we now look forward to the formalisation of the second-reading agreement .
we must continue to monitor this , a scientific discovery will always continue .
a rapporteur , i thank you for your support .
we have managed to find a good compromise from different starting position .
i would like more positive thinking for the new year .
europe is showing that it is the world 's trailblazer .
this is clarified quite clearly in the regulation on maximum residue level .
unfortunately , you did not mention this correction in the psd study .
therefore , please stop creating this fear and dissension .
- mr mcguinness , you have a point of order .
i heard what the commissioner said on the food import situation .
farmer in europe will be banned from using particular substance .
their cousin outside the european union can use these product .
we will not find residue in the food that come in .
we are talking about a competitive disadvantage for eu producer .
but i will state again that the problem is solved .
- we are not going to re-open the debate .
i would encourage you to continue it in the corridor , if necessary .
the joint debate is closed , and the vote will take place tomorrow .
they could have been included among the non-chemical method .
the compromise text prof to u that this is not the case .
in the current economic crisis , boosting food production may be one solution .
this version is considered therefore to offer sufficient guarantee .
can you reassure me , commissioner , that the action plan is ready ?
can we accept that there should be difference between member state ?
between city , in standard of protection for the urban environment ?
the highlight ha been the extremely successful civitas programme that started in 2000 .
but what can be done concretely at eu level ?
let u take this step , keep this promise !
possibility number two : you say that the condition are not favourable .
commissioner , we are a few week away from the election .
urban traffic play a key role in the context of climate change .
it is responsible for about 70 % of all greenhouse gas in city .
we green request that eu cofinancing be redesigned to be environmentally friendly .
in all our city , we face problem of mobility .
what response can we give to europe 's citizen ?
revision of the broadcasting communication - state aid for public broadcasting ( debate )
even the directorate-general for competition attended in great number .
i am vehemently opposed to the commission 's plan .
member state organise and finance the public broadcaster a they see fit .
a market test will inevitably increase the level of paperwork .
this initiative is not workable in small member state .
there are also difference in term of language and culture .
i should like to ask the commission a few more question .
we are serious about the process of wide consultation .
this dialogue between the commission and parliament is important .
we stand ready to listen and to reply to your question .
this concurs with our view ; both public and private broadcasting are important .
the draft ensures that our rule reflect the rapidly changing new medium environment .
the objective of modernising the communication is to increase transparency and legal certainty .
because having these test at the national level help to avoid commission intervention .
secondly , the draft exempts pilot project from the test .
public broadcaster can therefore continue experimenting with new medium without any preliminary test .
the solution found in these country are proportionate to the resource available .
this is crucial for a balanced supply , and it also benefit quality .
well , to some extent , this is true , but not entirely .
i should like to share our reservation with you regarding the proposal .
my main objection is that it clash with the lisbon strategy .
there should be room for both to be able to provide quality content .
this is the political question which we are basically required to resolve .
this financial balance , therefore , must be protected .
we require this a part of the lisbon strategy .
i hope that the commission will take these comment into consideration .
i should also like to say a few word about the red tape .
so , just a in europe , the two are intertwined .
there are already controlling body for public broadcasting : the broadcasting council .
we monitor the measure in order to ensure fair competition .
we are in turn completely and rightly controlled by the public .
out of the many problem i will mention three .
public broadcaster will be able to experiment freely with new project .
the draft communication make clear that pilot project are exempt from the test .
this will also remain the case for the future .
the commission also want to guarantee a mixture of public and private .
i want to assure you that we take the consultation very seriously .
we will review the text to take into account legitimate concern .
trade and economic relation with western balkan ( short presentation )
moreover , that region is of major strategic significance for europe .
the specific proposal in my report are a follows .
the union should endeavour to adopt an external energy policy .
i am also member of the committee on foreign affair .
a a result , i feel much empathy and involvement with that region .
allow me to focus on some point highlighted in your report .
the eu is the western balkan ' main trading partner .
this is essential for facilitating and deepening regional cooperation and good neighbourly relation .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
i would like to draw your attention to three aspect :
the common agricultural policy and global food security ( short presentation )
thirty thousand child die of hunger and poverty-related illness a day .
by providing stable price and also looking at the cost of food production .
unless farmer get that income stimulus , they will pull back .
well over a year ago we were talking about high commodity price .
the topic of biofuels wa discussed in detail during the various ep session .
a sustainable eu biofuels policy is overall a pro-poor policy .
various high-level event have placed global food security high on the international agenda .
enhanced trade flow are part of the solution towards food security .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
integrated and effective policy are needed , such a :
the fact is , 860 million people continue to starve .
this strategy should be based on prevention , traceability and responsiveness .
the agricultural sector need to improve it energy efficiency .
incentive to encourage sustainable cultivation of energy crop should not jeopardise food production .
i believe that agricultural research is required in order to boost farm productivity .
developing civil dialogue under the treaty of lisbon ( short presentation )
there is an ever increasing range of union communication policy in this area .
the new term civil dialogue ha even been coined to describe these policy .
that is why i refer to civil dialogue in this report .
the latter is a dialogue that is not defined in law .
i would like civil dialogue to be a reciprocal , two-sided process .
that is why we also need feedback from the union to the citizen .
we should systematically publish the list of organisation involved in consultation .
it is not easy to establish rule governing this area .
these would become common principle for all the institution .
i have been unable to mention every part of this report .
we agree that civil society play an important role in european integration .
this will only be possible if eu institution and member state work together .
eleven new management partnership in 2009 will make this approach even more effective .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
this must be prevented in future by a pro-active information and dialogue policy .
after all , the treaty of lisbon is dead .
this mean that the aforementioned document doe not have legal force .
building anything on it is like building on sand , without foundation .
this all brings to mind the definition of democracy .
public finance in the emu - 2007-2008 ( short presentation )
the report we will be voting on tomorrow ha been constantly updated .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
we have worked very well together on the production of the report .
i would also like to thank the commission and the committee secretariat .
we have made many new joint discovery during the debate in committee .
nevertheless , some member state have not undertaken transposal .
there are a large number of case of deficient transposal .
this applies not only to consumer but also to small enterprise and tradespeople .
we know about cheating on the lottery and much more besides .
we hope that it will continue to work on this .
the commission also coordinated cooperation on transposition in order to avoid incorrect transposition .
for those case the commission will not hesitate to launch infringement proceeding .
such practice should continue to be regulated solely by this directive .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
cfp and the ecosystem approach to fishery management ( short presentation )
i will therefore not comment specifically on these question here .
the vote will take place on tuesday at 12 noon .
i would like to extend my thanks to all of these woman .
( the sitting wa closed at 10.45 p.m . )
the fund industry ha not escaped unscathed from the financial crisis .
i would just like to conclude with two final comment .
this will facilitate the adoption of ucits iv modification in a single reading .
it set some clear objective for improving the functioning of the ucits directive .
however , it is not only about being competitive .
this wa my one and only consideration dealing with the management company passport .
we have come a long way since july 2008 .
the commission can now sign up to the compromise text .
our work in this is , however , not finished .
very strict deadline have been imposed on the commission in delivering these measure .
we have expressed our concern on the feasibility of these deadline .
the commission will endeavour to start this process a quickly a possible .
firstly , regarding the issue of taxation of cross-border merger .
the original ucits directive wa the key to development for european investment fund .
however , the regulation must change to promote the development of these fund .
in 2005 it wa followed by a white paper .
it is a complete passport and we welcome it .
it may be that fundamental question need to be asked .
even without the financial crisis , these issue are difficult to deal with .
the rule concerning the management company passport have been a sensitive issue .
however , i think that the present proposal is a good one .
competition and openness are always good in a well-organised market .
a balance must be achieved between relevant information and effectiveness .
too much information is not good but neither is too little .
a reasonable balance is also required in this area .
let u safeguard this development , which is also something this proposal doe .
i believe it not only protects consumer but is also good for investor .
they described it at the time a a backward step .
most importantly , we have to achieve greater economy of scale in europe .
this must only be in the interest of the investor .
the second observation relates to the issue of retention .
my third observation relates to the issue of supervision .
we thus need the supervision issue in this area to be defined .
finally , my last observation is about tax regime issue .
the rapporteur ha mentioned them and the commissioner ha made a commitment .
it is a result of a remarkably quick consensus .
arrangement for cooperation between national supervisor will have to be put in place .
these are key to the good functioning of the management company passport .
( the sitting wa suspended at 09.40 and resumed at 10.00 . )
formal sitting and debate - 10th anniversary of the euro
the euro area ha become a rock of macroeconomic stability .
the importance of the european central bank simply can not be overestimated .
this price stability is an advantage for all european citizen .
the single currency is a factor for dynamism in the european economy .
the european parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage .
these challenge were successfully overcome and the euro is firmly established today .
current challenge are pressing and new challenge will arise .
the continued success of emu depends on how these challenge are addressed .
the crisis ha revealed fundamental weakness in the global financial system .
when we started out 10 year ago , we were 11 country .
what matter most today is our responsibility for the future .
the journey ha not been without it difficulty and shock .
the euro and economic and monetary union have undeniably been a success .
the crisis is , without a doubt , a touchstone for the euro .
today we must say a big 'thank you ' to all of them .
what fine word can we use in our anniversary toast ?
let u counter the inevitability of failure with the energy of success .
that success today go by the lovely name of the euro .
it demonstrates the best that europe can achieve when everyone join force .
some government are loath to provide europe with symbol .
of course , we are not all using the euro .
i think that this is the best proof of our success .
however , an anniversary is also a time for looking to the future .
government must learn to talk together about their economic policy .
the same applies when it come to supervising the financial market .
this is why it is a major issue for this parliament .
however , we can not necessarily take the euro for granted in future .
that is something we can all be proud of .
in 10 year , the euro ha become a strong symbol for europe .
for those who travel , the advantage of a single currency wa obvious .
for those who do not , the euro wa associated with price rise .
today , the crisis ha changed many of these perception .
the european central bank ha certainly been the most responsive central bank .
they are the guarantee of effectiveness , competiveness and growth .
they are the condition for the solidity of our currency , the euro .
in any case , the attraction of the euro remains intact .
in fact , the financial world is tending towards a euro/dollar duopoly .
any monetary duopoly regularly go through parity adjustment which often occur suddenly .
the euro will have a key role to play in this new stability .
the ecb is only in charge of monetary policy .
today , the fact tell a rather different story .
it ha a hugely important role to play here .
quite the reverse : we must ensure that it remains valid .
the european central bank will gain a new task in the coming year .
the euro 's international role need to be further strengthened .
the maastricht treaty wa approved , but no political europe wa created .
this is the very problem which we are facing today .
why were we against the euro at that time ?
the third major transformation is the change to how thing work in practice .
the task of setting the exchange rate is assigned to the council .
we must find the proper instrument to do this .
the idea that the ecb ha done a good job is extraordinary .
the euro zone ha never been tested but it is about to be .
but the greek government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket .
it will take leadership , or possibly the inevitable economic meltdown .
we have been able to do the thing that we need to do .
you can go on burying your head in the sand if you want .
the imbalance long predicted by sceptic are starting to bite .
emu protects the profit of the monopoly and facilitates privatisation and merger .
the euro wa 10 year old on 1 january 2009 .
this will nevertheless require considerable effort on the part of the union .
according to current estimate , it will be around 0.6 % .
on 1 january 2009 the euro became the official currency of slovakia .

( de ) madam president , i have the following request .
i would appreciate it if you would allow me to do that .
madam president , likewise , if i could have the same forbearance .
my request is on it way to you a well .
i rarely get such an opportunity to make myself heard by so many .
nobody could be against that , and i am certainly not against that .
the problem is that we do not agree on what food security is .
for others , it is an excuse for protectionism .
food security to them mean only food produced in the eu for european .
'local production ' is a phrase that i often hear used .
madam president , this go to the core of this whole european union .
people do not want more control in brussels and strasbourg .
however , it is important to understand that civil dialogue is two-sided .
the eu ha to be able to receive a well a transmit .
madam president , thank you all for your patience in the chamber .
we will return to the explanation of vote after the formal sitting .
we live today in peace , freedom and democracy .
our citizen enjoy prospect that our forefather could only have dreamed of .
it is true that today the european union face new and serious challenge .
may i warmly welcome you once again to the european parliament .
i thank you for having carried out your duty with distinction .
it wa brought about by the presence of tank , repression and threat .
we have a common history , but our fate have been diverse .
today , i should like to look at much more recent history .
what sort of time ha this been for latvia ?
our state institution had to learn how to live in the european union .
even eurosceptics soon get used to good thing , and become simply sceptic .
until now , the financial market were able to develop very freely .
we believed that the market alone would put everything in it place .
at the global level , coordinated action to restart economic growth is essential .
the most difficult challenge will be to strike precisely this balance .
we welcome the commission 's european economic recovery plan .
i shall spend a little more time on national-level solution .
it is important for latvia not to be left alone in this situation .
latvia ha always seen neighbourhood relation in a wider dimension .
latvia note with pleasure the european commission 's proposal in this regard .
each of these state is following it own path of development .
the financial and economic crisis is cyclical in it own way .
the european union ha the foreign policy instrument to resolve this issue .
trade and transport in the region are developing apace .
here , the european commission ha done noteworthy work .
what ha altered is the environment in which we must achieve this aim .
europe 's dynamic growth ha given europe the opportunity to compete globally .
it is important to unite in our multiformity and diversity .
it is important to continue working on improving the european union .
that is a task that all european must take on together .
it is essential to prevent fragmentation of the european union .
we can no longer consider and perceive ourselves separately from europe .
how do i see the european union and latvia in the longer term ?
the post-crisis economic world will have coalesced into several economic power centre .
what will be latvia 's role in the european union of 2015 ?
that will be a time when latvia will have emerged from the crisis .
latvia 's economy will be more balanced , more competitive and structurally transformed .
it will grow more powerful in it economy , welfare and mutual cooperation .
you addressed the energy question and i shall reply to you very briefly .
there is no question that we need a regulatory system for pesticide .
madam president , i have a confession to make .
madam president , i too found this a particularly difficult decision .
i think we need impact assessment conducted on a scientific basis .
madam president , the efficient and effective use of pesticide is a necessity .
we need an explanation of that in order to bring farmer with u .
let u make sure that doe not happen again .
that is why i voted to undermine the compromise .
in my experience this is the opposite of the truth .
similarly , farmer have also been the basis of our health .
they produce the good food that is the basis of our good health .
linked to this discussion is that related to security .
just like the issue of safety one can never be too secure .
indeed , it is when we feel too secure that terror strike again .
innocent civilian are purposely targeted and the civilian of certain country preselected .
this entail obligation and method for cooperation between exporting and importing authority .
i agree in principle with paolo costa 's report on civil aviation .
criterion must be found to which both party must adhere .
i agree with the rapporteur 's proposal on the conclusion of this agreement .
serbia , for example , is not even mentioned .
all these important aspect are reflected in the report .
a realistic perspective of membership can also prevent this .
albania is not montenegro , and bosnia-herzegovina is not kosovo .
this challenge will continue to grow a the world 's population expands .
the current population growth rate is over 70 million per year .
this mean providing food for 70 million more people every year .
we are seeing this now in large part of africa , in particular .
we agree with various aspect highlighted by the report , in particular :
however , there are also aspect with which we can not agree :
this is of fundamental importance in term of safeguarding food production .
it merely serf to expose the eu 's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .
for these reason , i support m grabowska 's report .
then it would have some credibility when it spoke of democracy .
this entail an unnecessary increase in bureaucracy that lead nowhere .
this proposal is yet another step towards constructing an eu state .
it is little known that the lisbon treaty strengthens participatory democracy .
however , it is necessary to ensure that they are representative and transparent .
the lisbon treaty accord dialogue with citizen the status of an imperative .
this is binding on all eu policy and sphere of activity .
at any rate , i emphatically voted against this report again .
nec spe , nec metu or without hope or fear .
fine here need to be drastically increased , especially for repeat offence .
the post-christmas sale provide an excellent opportunity for checking .
there are alternative policy for the fishing industry in portugal .
in writing . - i voted in favour of mr guerreiro 's report .
that is why we voted in favour of the compromise .
i agree with the rapporteur and congratulate her on the final report .
the debate wa a heated one within our group too .
a linear reduction in the number of product would be insane .
the problem with france must be solved with understanding .
i still regret the fact that we dropped the 50 % objective .
this , too , is now being left to the member state .
undoubtedly , business will shed job and even cease trading altogether .
undoubtedly , our hard-pressed farmer will be faced with yet more bureaucratic headache .
no-one dispute the importance of protecting the environment but this legislation is unbalanced .
in writing . - i voted against the amendment to the breyer report .
this is not the position taken by farmer in other member state .
this document will help to harmonise the legislation on pesticide .
there would be a risk in lumping together completely different situation .
the chinese toy episode should be a lesson to u .
there ha been no impact assessment of the proposal ;
we also had our reservation with regard to the zonal approach .
in writing . - i wa disappointed to see the common position amended .
the proposal seek to protect bee and reduce red tape for substance authorisation .
we can not vote in favour of this legislation .
hiltrud breyer 's report is on the right line .
mr klinz ha presented a compromise document that i can support .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
security feature and biometrics in passport and travel document ( debate )
contrary to the procedure in 2004 , we are now in codecision .
it is true that the national legislature could create derogation from this obligation .
i do not think i need to go on further .
in fact , this mean the staff at the local post office .
this revolutionary principle ha nothing to do with biometric data .
the principle is that of 'one person-one passport ' .
let u not hide the fact that the compromise wa extremely difficult .
child must be exempted from the requirement to provide biometric fingerprint for passport .
it is therefore right to create an exemption here for child .
this report doe not speak about the reliability of biometric data itself .
the uk independence party will therefore be voting against this report .
of course , this will carry a price tag .
at present , member state are still fairly divided on this issue .
commissioner , our child 's safety demand our permanent attention .
their fingerprint change so quickly that passport and recognition from them are useless .
i wish to comment on just one point in the report .
in short , we should be reasonably flexible in this regard .
this wa also mentioned by some of our fellow member who spoke previously .
i think the report is not only important , but also good .
that balance ha , i think , been found in this report .
mr president , i also wish to thank mr coelho .
we have check and balance , but we can do better .
the new method of identification will simplify border control .
( ro ) i would like to congratulate mr coelho for this report .
i would therefore ask the commission to reassess the relevant text .
i therefore welcome the use of biometric data on passport and other document .
i just wanted to raise a point for future reference .
this stay the same from conception to death and even beyond .
for me it go without saying that data protection law must be respected .
it is the duty of a constitutional state to control that .
i will give the parliament several answer to several question .
the passport is only required for travel beyond the european union .
thank you very much to all of you for your collaboration .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , at 12 noon .
in estonia it ha been in force since 2000 .
there will , however , be an absolute age limit of six year .
it also make the opportunity for child trafficking more difficult .
public access to european parliament , council and commission document ( debate )
we are entitled to know who is voting in the council and how .
we are committed to continuing to enhance transparency and openness .
we are always doing our utmost to modernise our internal it system .
you were the one who introduced 18 amendment to your own report .
firstly , some are impossible ; you make some suggestion that are impossible .
there is a need for privacy , since privacy is a political asset .
i can not , therefore , agree with you on this point .
some of your other assertion , mr cappato , are incorrect .
furthermore , comitology ha it own implicit transparency standard .
but of course you have gone beyond your remit .
we are not going to have broadcast of political group .
that is what we need to get back to .
we need to define what the 'legislative capacity ' is .
we all want to take the whole issue of access forward .
that is why drawing up the voting list will be difficult .
my heart is with you , but i have to follow my head .
otherwise , party conference would not be broadcast so extensively .
thank you very much for the extra time , mr president .
only then may the union regain the credibility it ha carelessly tossed aside .
however , these debate do not include political group debate .
i think that this report is a significant step towards transparency .
the rapporteur might want to bear this in mind .
i also support the amendment tabled by the rapporteur .
i support the proposal for a combined public register .
mr president , in a democracy , transparency is a concept of honour .
in democratic country , the citizen elect the governing authority .
the fact that this happens nevertheless ha two explanation .
the subject were not permitted to interfere in the ruler 's affair .
the eu doe not have a proud tradition of transparency .
there is a lot of internal resistance to quash .
i will vote for nearly everything contained in his proposal .
setting up a single access point with regard to preparatory document .
negotiation lead to the most acceptable decision for all concerned .
citizen must be able to acquire a full understanding of our activity .
this is our route now and in the future .
it is important that we are debating it here in parliament .
by this i mean that our workload is really quite broad .
it is not just attendance at committee or plenary .
that would be an achievement , and i say this after 10 year .
nevertheless , we must clearly respect the legal basis at our disposal .
our parliament must set an example for the other institution .
mr president , i noted carefully what the rapporteur said .
we should remember that the union wa created for these very citizen .
i think we are still struggling with that in some case .
you can also improve and add to openness and transparency .
this is certainly a part of strengthening democracy in europe .
that would be one of the ultimate test for all of u .
i personally have been a direct victim of this .
however , there is a general misconception on our revenue .
public contract in the field of defence and security ( debate )
this goal is a long way off , however .
one of the reason for this is our fragmented defence equipment market .
in this situation , it is clear what it is all about .
it ha done so , in agreement with both parliament and the council .
the agreement at first reading is a result of this common political will .
i would also like to thank the council and the commission .
i would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur for their constructive cooperation .
the commission welcome the text that we have now on the table .
the new directive is tailor-made for defence and security procurement .
this , in turn , will reduce cost and lead to lower price .
all this is also the fruit of your work and your input .
let me therefore once again thank you and congratulate you on this .
many element from the 2004 procurement directive have been retained here .
we are in agreement with our national colleague on this issue .
for the council , it wa not at all so clear cut .
this , however , is a task for the future .
finally , i do not wish to express my thanks .
it wa not , in fact , necessary for this legislative package .
i know he dedicated himself to this very important work .
mr president , commissioner , mr lambsdorff ha done an excellent job .
the spending of public money ha always stirred up strong feeling .
i think that we will have to return to this subject .
they did not succeed and that is a good thing .
the main importer state are those of the middle east .
it is very clear what this is really all about .
this morning we celebrated 10 year of the euro .
the european union spends a little over 200 billion on the same .
i have prepared the opinion of the committee on foreign affair .
in fact , this translates a desire for integration of state sovereignty .
the same thing will be noted in the field of justice .
it certainly ha nothing to do with strengthening defence capability .
it will be a brake on r & d .
today , even the large member state have trouble funding new defence system .
this is in the interest of bringing our industry together across europe .
hence , it is to a large extent parliament 's proposal .
the commission can accept all these amendment and therefore support the text .
she said that these product are expensive through lack of competition .
yes , when there is no competition , they are expensive .
we will hopefully introduce more competition into the european internal market .
it will be an opportunity for the political europe .
this is an opportunity that we must take advantage of .
it is about market extremism , which is evident in this area .
no one can deny that this is the case .
to suggest anything else would indicate a total fixation on the european union .
defence minister should be responsible for establishing implementation priority .
the next item is question time ( b6-0001/2009 ) .
all these kind of development call for deeper budgetary surveillance .
i think the important thing is that we need to work together .
member of the commission . - what is the role of the eurogroup ?
( de ) commissioner , i am interested in the following point .
is the commission already planning which country could possibly become member in future ?
it is not up to the commission to answer that question .
it could perhaps be one of the two member state with an opt-out .
this morning we were commemorating here the 10th anniversary of the euro .
the market are not rewarding those who are not in the euro .
subject : collapse in dairy price on the eu market
both price thus appear to be descending unstoppably towards the intervention level .
i would also like to remind you of the situation back in 2007 .
this show clearly that dairy producer are reacting to market signal .
( pt ) thank you for your clarification , commissioner .
we find ourselves in a situation today where the market is extremely difficult .
with respect , your staff indicated that my request had been noted .
i am sorry , according to my staff , no one saw you .
the commission is in favour of developing microcredit and microfinance institution more generally .
( de ) i have only one brief question .
developing country generally have extremely fragile policy on these thing .
i can see what you would hope to achieve by it , too .
however , this is just off the top of my head .
among those initiative which are already in place is the european transparency initiative .
some other issue mentioned in the consultation deserve our serious attention .
you are aware of this with regard to some fund .
the responsibility of the member state are another important element .
a clearer allocation of responsibility between member state and the commission is needed .
the third element is the rigidity of our budget .
member of the commission . - so , three additional question .
it is a very sensible question on cap in general .
that is how we probably will see the medium-term future .
but , of course , not everything suited all participant .
on the third question on priority , you are absolutely right .
negotiation on budget finalisation usually centre on juste retour negotiation .
i think it is a big gap in the market .
i would like you to bear those in mind a we go forward .
( sv ) i have a short question to ask the commissioner .
what is the influence of the financial crisis on these discussion ?
concerning the mid-term review , i think there is a misunderstanding .
what is the commission doing to fight against cybercrime at eu level ?
the commission is now looking at how to update and implement these instrument .
the european union can not regulate it on it own .
i would like to ask you a supplementary question , commissioner .
that is one way in which we are addressing this issue .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i have not heard anything about an opt-out clause in this field .
i think i have more or le answered your question .
this programme also support cooperation between spain and colombia for developing circular migration .
the truth is that illegal immigration to europe continues .
ha the commission encouraged member state to adopt a common position on this ?
i do not wish to go back over the return directive .
what are the possible negative repercussion of opening up some closed profession ?
i should like to hear the commissioner 's thought on this issue .
the question about pharmacist wa raised by mr angelakas .
the question that mr doyle raise is that of gambling infringement .
there ha been court jurisprudence on this particular matter .
there are various stage of proceeding against member state in this area .
we are also inundated with lot of other possible infringement in this area .
this proposal go further than the rule existing in any other jurisdiction .
the financial crisis shed a new light on cras .
since august 2007 the financial market worldwide suffered from a major confidence crisis .
this financial crisis is a complex phenomenon involving multiple actor .
the crisis highlighted poor performance by credit rating agency .
the rapid adoption and implementation of these proposal is elementary .
we need to demonstrate that europe can provide concrete answer .
it will clearly require a further strengthening of the internal market .
this flexibility certainly doe not mean any change to the single market principle .
i hope the commissioner 's voice get a little bit better .
could i invite the commissioner to start talking about that recovery ?
the next item is the commission statement on the pharmaceutical product package .
however , health or restoration to health is not just a right .
the rapidly growing number of fake medicine have forced u to act .
the problem ha also affected the legal supply chain for medicine .
we have discovered fake medicine at different stage of the supply chain .
the proposal 's sole objective is to improve patient safety .
the sector in question ha been responsible for a striking information campaign .
in this case you could almost call it a disinformation campaign .
this will be achieved by making responsibility clearer and reporting obligation more effective .
in addition , manufacturer must introduce an efficient monitoring system .
finally , the pharmaceutical package includes a proposal for improved patient information .
patient have a right to information and this applies in particular to medicine .
the significance of health will continue to increase in our aging society .
the first place that these people look is the internet .
in my opinion this situation is both dreadful and intolerable .
exception to this will only be permitted in the context of effective system .
counterfeiting is one of the curse of our age .
supervision of a medicine is limited once it reach the market .
we all know that patient information about medicine is a controversial topic .
a commissioner verheugen himself say , this is a modern and progressive proposal .
madam president , i would like to thank the commission for it statement .
i think that it is good to address environmental aspect , for example .
contamination from pharmaceutical product is a growing problem in treatment work .
i have really become quite tired of this issue .
i would therefore like u to tighten up the legislation in this area .
finally , i would just like to say something about nanotechnology .
that is why medicine price have been rising disproportionately on european market .
this is perhaps not particularly strange , a pharmaceutical product affect everyone .
i do not want to see advertisement for prescription pharmaceutical product .
i am therefore pleased that the commission appears to share this view .
in sweden , for example , we have a system called fas .
my other question relates to the name of medicine in cross-border region .
some year ago here we had the pharmaceutical review .
that included veterinary medicine , a well a human pharmaceutical .
they should get properly reviewed scientific information at first hand with their medicine .
i really do not understand how anyone could believe that this wa advertising .
the issue of counterfeit medicine is unrelated to intellectual property .
counterfeit medicine are produced for reason of pure greed .
there is no question of violating right to intellectual property .
however , this information wa not available to them .
these statistic show that patient information can even save money .
however , the ban on advertising also applies to these magazine and brochure .
these publication are not allowed to contain advertising for prescription-only medicine .
european approval is the exception , not the rule .
i think the structure are very different in these case .
for example , animal are not able to find out about medicine themselves .
the relationship between demand and availability is quite different .
however , i will be very happy to consider this problem further .
dangerous substance and preparation ( dichloromethane ) ( debate )
what we are discussing is dichloromethane ( dcm ) , a paint stripper .
it is predominantly when it is sold to consumer that there are problem .
we are now creating a market for the alternative .
mr schlyter recommends that you support the compromise text negotiated with the council .
i also believe that this compromise represents a good balance .
they are carcinogenic and they cause neurotic effect with nerve damage .
under normal temperature their use cause them to evaporate to dangerous level .
i am sure that in reality there have been more .
these product can be used safely industrially in the right condition .
i mentioned that i have a constituency interest in this .
it ha the same effect even if the process take a little longer .
dichloromethane will come off the market for non-industrial use .
by and large , this is a good agreement .
i would like to urge the commission to draw inspiration from this decision .
that is not the way to conduct a progressive programme of environmental legislation .
commission , commissioner verheugen , please do convince me otherwise !
it ha been a hard road to get to this .
there is evidence that there have been accident and people have been hurt .
you have played an important role in bringing about this proposal .
this occurs only with dichloromethane and not with the other substance .
we are aware of very few accident involving the alternative substance .
we take the healthcare-related and environmental argument of the member state seriously .
i would just like to illustrate this chemical to you all .
that is how very toxic this particular chemical is .
if this is done , dcm will phase itself out sufficiently quickly .
it also alarming that there have been death linked to dichloromethane poisoning .
it is accompanied by a recommendation ( no 199 ) .
all european institution support the generally recognised programme for decent work .
the area of shared competence also cover several other theme .
the difficulty in reconciling those position are extremely complex .
what condition do those working in that factory ship experience ?
from what i wa told i suspect they were not good .
this must all be ratified a soon a possible , before 2012 .
( the sitting wa opened at 9.05 a.m . )
presentation of the czech presidency 's programme ( debate )
a very warm welcome to you , mr topolánek .
once again , a very warm welcome to the european parliament .
france played an important role in the birth of the modern czech state .
i see only one way of fulfilling this task honourably .
what matter is the ability to serve a common idea .
i can not imagine coming before you in any other way .
i shall always rigorously , decisively and correctly uphold that here .
in the eu , they say the czech are always dissatisfied with something .
the czech presidency come in a year significant for a number of reason .
finally , the issue of energy security once again demand our urgent attention .
we can contribute to the current debate with our recommendation and our expert .
i would add to that the subtitle 'a europe of rule ' .
this vision gain new importance in today 's troubled political and economic situation .
for anyone in need of exercise , 2 g is plenty of exertion .
turning , now , to individual area in more detail :
an example of these important structural reform is the common agricultural policy .
the czech republic is taking a very high profile in this area .
even more urgently and compellingly , i would say .
naturally , we are also interested in diversifying the supply and transport route .
the eu country ' energy mix must be diversified .
we need to think seriously about developing safe nuclear energy .
such a consensus should also reflect current trend in the world economy .
in the long term , we can only succeed if we work together .
on the contrary , they underline the necessity of finding a peaceful solution .
this will undoubtedly help u in our internal political debate a well .
i began by saying that the czech question is also a european question .
we have a solid foundation from which to start .
in 2008 , the union also proved it capacity to adapt to change .
the union also enters 2009 secure in the strength of it international reputation .
we shall draft our proposal with the budgetary review in mind .
i will focus my remark today on energy and on the economy .
it is here where europe 's citizen will feel most pressure this year .
the current situation is , in short , both unacceptable and incredible .
i would like to convey a very clear message to moscow and kiev .
europe must act now to avoid future repetition of this type of situation .
let me now widen the scope and look at the economy .
all the sign are that the economic climate is continuing to worsen .
thing are likely to get worse before becoming better .
we have designed the right strategy to get u through this crisis .
the social consequence of the crisis must be addressed directly .
rule to ensure the long-term sustainability of our way of life .
you are right , mr topolánek and mr barroso .
why doe the world have it eye glued to barack obama ?
he put that right , which is a good thing .
i should like to take up one of the point you raised .
prime minister , this is a decisive period in international politics .
therefore , this period in prague castle wa truly european .
your recipe will be contested , but not by liberal and democrat .
currently , our monitor are blocked from ukrainian dispatch centre .
on the eu in the world , we welcome your presidency 's ambition .
the tag line for your presidency is 'europe without border ' .
president-in-office , we , your fellow european , are your friend .
your country 's president compared the european union to the soviet union .
he who wish to remain on the margin is free to do so .
but this is a union of friend - friend , equal and partner .
stick to them , and we will stick by you .
i know you have the capacity to meet those challenge .
consequently , that is the way history ha progressed .
i believe that we have an opportunity to bring an end to this .
i mean to say that we all need the courage to change .
it will prove that smaller country are equally capable of managing the eu .
you see , we have experience in one other area too .
do this in the name of democracy and freedom .
stop persuading yourself that the treaty of lisbon is a necessary evil .
it is simply evil , and you can change it .
mr topolánek , necessary evil is a coward 's alibi .
you are no coward , or at least i hope you are not .
that happens to be my personal view of it .
i wish all of u every success in this respect .
allow me to take up one aspect of your speech : energy security .
independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy source .
this is a requirement of security for our continent .
thank you , mr barroso , for your very clear word this morning .
to do that , we have to act together .
this already show gazprom that we are not united .
the main priority is the building in eastern europe .
mr koch-mehrin , you sound ridiculous when you mention that .
you have said that freedom and decision-making are of fundamental importance .
i should also like to welcome it by expressing our hope .
in a democracy , it is the people who decide .
you are supporting sensible measure to ensure the economic slowdown is tackled .
make the eu more active , visible and credible in the middle east .
try to develop a more responsible eu policy on energy and energy supply .
this is something to be learned from the french presidency .
the czech republic is also affected by this trend .
firstly , the motto you have chosen is 'europe without barrier ' .
i am the rapporteur on the application of the free movement directive .
unfortunately , it seems that your motto is under threat from national authority .
president-in-office , go to lampedusa and see how serious the problem is .
the euro-barometer , which we always ignore , tell u a much .
you have spelled out an ambitious programme to deal with these .
such respect bodes well for your presidency and for europe .
i am of course talking about president václav havel .
i have two comment and question for the president-in-office .
secondly , president-in-office of the council , you have not mentioned the euro .
to these , we can add an energy crisis .
history ha shown that every financial crisis is followed by a technological shift .
ukraine 's gas supply is cut off and russian tank enter georgia .
for so long , europe 's common value remain nothing but a dream .
this is the crossroad of both your presidency priority .
you have to find an emergency solidarity solution right now .
we need you to design a comprehensive and decisive strategy .
this partnership would contribute to preventing another crisis like the present one .
many other policy area can be looked at in the same way .
madam president , i should like to ask the president-in-office four question .
it wa they who presided over it and got u into it .
i look forward to such a political defenestration now .
the situation in the gaza strip can no longer be tolerated .
with previous presidency , we have not been very used to that .
i beg you : 2008 is over , ratify in 2009 !
our current activity are a coordinator and are non-binding .
you should still be able to correct the german version .
( pt ) mr president-in-office , you spoke of a europe of rule .
you spoke a lot about rule , in fact .
now , one of the rule of democracy is the fulfilment of undertaking .
happily , the poll indicate a 'yes ' majority .
now , this will only be possible with the treaty of lisbon .
the time we are living in underline the need for reform and change .
( de ) madam president . president-in-office , you have a particular responsibility .
these test can be passed only if we all give of our best .
the czech president describes the climate change package a a silly luxury .
i will work hard to ensure a positive outcome for ireland and europe .
your comment here today have made that task much harder .
i call upon you to keep this priority and to fully ...
during this presidency , we will have low growth and unemployment will rise .
this will provide a higher rate of growth and increased employment .
finally , i would like to mention family policy .
you point down a completely different path in your programme .
in bulgaria alone more than 160 000 household have been left without heating .
one important element in this is to improve the energy infrastructure .
i agree with those who urge the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
i believe the role of education is especially important ...
i hope that you and your first-rate team will be more successful .
young people are no longer convinced by pronouncement and promise .
they do not accept euro-scepticism , the fear of europe .
they have a problem with the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
it is the new generation that can understand what is meant by ...
i stress the special intellectual and political importance of the czech presidency .
american satellite state have no place in our union .
so , you must make up your mind : eu or u ?
i would like to extend my gratitude to president barroso .
before i came here , i swore i would tell no joke .
the treaty of lisbon can not be a mantra .
it must be a mean , not an end .
it is a mean to improve the working of the european union .
my government is the first government that will meet the maastricht criterion .
i do not look on this a a race .
i will actually comment on 'a europe without barrier ' .
yes , it is meant to have at least three sens .
václav havel is gravely ill and ha been hospitalised .
breaking down this taboo is actually the objective of the slovak-czech nuclear forum .
we must look for the tool to overcome a number of technical problem .
i will attempt to make way for your next proceeding .
we also value the opportunity to preside over this entire community .
we also appreciate the fact that we can tackle many problem .
what we value most of all is the internal liberal debate .
yes , we need an urgent revision of the gas security directive .
that wa the substance of our strategic energy review presented very recently .
many of you spoke about the czech presidency and how important it is .
i have full confidence in what you are going to do .
that is why we need the treaty of lisbon .
let 's hope that president klaus is the man to do that .
i wholeheartedly wish our southern neighbour a successful presidency !
it must now see it concrete aspect implemented rapidly and effectively .
the problem of the gaza conflict ha political dimension .
jew and palestinian can live peacefully side by side .
please be unrelenting in your effort to achieve this aim .
the czech presidency find itself in a difficult situation .
the people need to respond to eu aggression by counterattacking .
this year mark 20 year since the fall of the iron curtain .
the czech presidency follows on from a very dynamic and ambitious french presidency .
it is unlikely that no comparison will be drawn between the two .
and not even political division in the national arena should stop them .
so grand vision - yes , but through the prism of everyday life .

situation of fundamental right in the european union ( 2004-2008 ) (
before the vote on the first part of paragraph 32
mr president , it is to complete the text of this amendment .
public access to european parliament , council and commission document (
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
these are legal immigrant , semi-legal immigrant but also illegal immigrant .
i voted against the coelho report for two reason .
i think it is time we drew attention to this .
i want to put that on the record , mr president .
i hope that it will be very soon indeed , mr president !
dcm is one of these substance and must be taken out of circulation .
fisherman face the highest incidence of serious occupational accident and death .
( de ) mr president , the catania report is a real sham .
this is something that i do not agree with and find unacceptable .
this is why i voted against catania 's report .
the report further stress the necessity of defining and determining national minority status .
i believe this is of vital importance for the 150 minority in europe .
we pervert it when we demand equality for it very antithesis .
if that subject me to ridicule then so be it .
now that would be a novelty in this temple of political correctness .
therefore benefit for young people , the disabled and the elderly are relevant .
- ( sk ) the catania report cover many human right issue .
in a normal society , right and duty go hand in hand .
quite the reverse : only we european are targeted ad nauseam .
i am very much opposed to the charter of fundamental right .
given that fundamental list of objection , i voted against this report .
child have the right to speak with their parent in their mother tongue .
the committee on petition ha recorded over 200 complaint in this matter .
therefore the uk independence party meps voted against this report .
it presentation of child 's right and basic social right merit special attention .
i agree with what ha been said by mr kinga gál .
that is why we abstained at the end of this vote .
i would like to thank you for this opportunity .
mr president , thank you for your very kind word .
the issuing of an ordinary passport in malta incurs expenditure .
this report make a hesitant step in that direction .
a strict , recurrent review of data security is therefore indispensable .
nevertheless , i reject biometric authentication system out of hand .
i voted in favour of the change proposed by the rapporteur .
a visa will soon set you back eur 60 .
is this not more trouble than it is worth ?
this is a market worth eur 90 billion annually .
mr lambsdorff ha proposed a common position that i can support .
above all , it put economic and market consideration above everything else .
these serious flaw on key point are the reason for our opposition .
for all these reason the conservative delegation abstained on the report .
the protection of human health must prevail over industrial interest .
this substance is classified a a category 3 carcinogenic agent .
various alternative to dcm-based stripper are already available on the market .
for this reason i could not support it in today 's vote .
the uk already ha perfectly good law and safeguard on fundamental right .
to my knowledge , such a tendency is also reflected in statistic .
for these reason i voted for the 45th amendment .
i voted against the report not because i am against fundamental right .
in addition , some member state disagree with such an extended interpretation .
it is therefore nothing more than a political gesture and wishful thinking .
to participate in them is the right of citizen .
in many respect i admire my own group 's basic position .
his text in fact denies the most fundamental human right :
the right to life , with the promotion of abortion and euthanasia ;
there is only one way to go : try them or release them .
for these reason , i voted against the report in the final vote .
ending street homelessness is a fundamental issue in the european union .
support for this report doe not imply support for that treaty .
therefore , the catania report is to be rejected in the strongest term .
we must also fight to ensure that social right are recognised .
poverty and job insecurity are attack on human right .
we must proclaim the fundamental right of each and every one of u .
the european union is endowed with a charter of fundamental right .
the european union stand for democracy and the rule of law .
i have therefore voted in favour of this paragraph .
twenty thousand people in iran who oppose the regime have been killed .
equal opportunity , particularly equality for woman , is another problem .
i served on the temporary committee into extraordinary rendition by the cia .
incorporating religious leader among the author of such comment .
applying this could have consequence in term of censorship .
perhaps the next such report could go into more detail on this matter .
in writing . - ( de ) i voted against the catania report .
in term of it content , virtually everything is worthy of criticism .
a positive attitude to abortion is inconceivable to me .
an international agreement would be more appropriate and far-sighted .
statement of this kind are very rare , and i welcome them .
unfortunately , the positive element are too few and far between .
it is above all to set out potential improvement in it operation .
the death penalty is a matter of conscience for each conservative mep .
however , i would like to highlight one aspect .
this wa not because we have a problem with transparency .
we are in favour of transparency and democratic control .
the rapporteur , however , draw no distinction between these procedure .
( explanation of vote abbreviated under rule 163 ( 1 ) )
in addition , they have a right to be informed about everything possible .
openness increase confidence in institution by allowing open debate .
in writing . - ( de ) i rejected this report .
the demand it make go way beyond what i understand by transparency .
i have a high attendance record and am therefore above suspicion .
it is important to preserve legal protection of personality for meps , too .
in doing this we can really contribute towards greater transparency for our citizen .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i wish you a very warm welcome too , commissioner .
the humanitarian consequence of this operation are dramatic for the population in gaza .
therefore , providing drinking water is of the utmost necessity .
there are also extensive food shortage at all level of the population .
the european union ha been closely following the tragic event from the outset .
the presidency led a diplomatic mission in the middle east .
the high representative also visited syria , lebanon and turkey .
the outline of a solution to the crisis have started to emerge .
gaza endured a really punishing economic blockade , totally undermining it economic development .
we need to address broader and more complicated challenge .
this is especially in the interest of israel and it neighbour .
we have been active from day one , which i think wa important .
we think it is very important that very soon something work .
dialogue should therefore resume both between israeli and palestinian and among palestinian .
this crisis show that a successful conclusion is more urgent than ever .
the question of palestinian reconciliation will also be central .
it is unlikely that hamas will be eradicated by this operation .
possibly it will come out debilitated militarily , but strengthened politically .
we are their friend and must tell them that we are doing this .
israel therefore can not afford to waste any time in reaching peace .
with friend it is all the more important to discus controversial subject openly .
so far , this conflict ha claimed 1 000 life in 17 day .
it is actually a shame that we are having to discus this .
i consider this a fundamental error regardless of which side belief it .
at that time , the main terrorist wa yasser arafat .
what wa possible then can be possible also in future .
well , the aim of this war is more security for israel .
and that is why we have to be very clear here .
mr schulz is right : israel need to be protected from itself !
it is not easy , but we must be clear .
this is a poor solution ; this is not the right solution !
that is one of the truth that hamas must also be told .
rahed is in despair , and is in the centre that we visited .
the security council must start to turn it word into concrete action .
i think it is important , and that it is a strong message .
in this , it receives full backing from the islamic republic of iran .
this seems to me to be the sensible starting point .
at the same time , the israeli attack must be stopped .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
this must be the starting point of a new israeli policy .
the border must be controlled , and the blockade must be lifted .
i should like to express my firm conviction before i conclude .
it is not the war that must be won today , but peace .
while our child were celebrating christmas , how many child died in gaza ?
two or three hundred ; and how many israeli civilian ?
we should feel the full weight of our responsibility .
unfortunately , above and beyond the emergency , europe remains inadequate .
protecting the civilian population - this is the real emergency .
the eu ha taken step , but only at a humanitarian level .
it ha to show decisiveness at the political level .
there can only be a political solution to this conflict .
to save future generation , we need to stop the war now .
here , a elsewhere , multiculturalism ha it limit .
where there are two people , there must be two state .
so , it is time to get down to work !
it is bordering on a humanitarian disaster and it requires immediate action .
we have announced them and we have supported them without result .
by taking this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
the principle of proportionality applies to private a well a international law .
this is not a proportionate response of a civilised power .
now we are completing negotiation with israel on an enhanced cooperation agreement .
we do not plan to condemn israel : we intend to reward it .
everyone know that a military solution will not work in the middle east .
in order to do this , the violence must be ended immediately .
the attack are immoral , and the international community can not accept them .
the peace process in the middle east must be put in place immediately .
that is the result , the collateral damage of this attack on gaza .
however , the resolution also raise issue about our own liability .
today i hear : 'it is necessary to talk to hamas ' .
we would have saved year if we had respected the election in palestine .
mr president , what is happening in gaza is heartbreaking .
that the devastation is perpetuated by a supposedly western nation is unfathomable .
there is no excuse ; there is no possible justification .
in 2007 the value of eu-israel trade wa eur 25.7 billion .
we must also call for the immediate application of the un resolution .
i should also like today to draw your attention to a new situation .
this suggests a radical change in the nature of the conflict .
there will never be security without peace , or peace without justice .
it is despair that grip u today ; this war is a tragedy .
those word , moreover , have become part of the palestinian vocabulary .
this is a terrible feeling , but it should not warrant hypocrisy .
however , the inhabitant of gaza are not just innocent victim .
they enthusiastically , knowingly , freely and democratically elected hamas and it charter .
anyone who elect criminal must logically share their fate .
the german freely elected hitler and shared in his fate .
the gazans also knew who they were electing and why .
this is the starting point that is important for the european union .
i strongly object to anyone trying to demonise a nation .
the conflict we are discussing today is an asymmetrical conflict .
it ha something to condemn , it ha authority .
there is a government that can be condemned and censured .
without an international presence , this conflict will never be resolved .
finally i would like to address those protesting against israel 's disproportionate action .
he ha until 5.20 p.m. at the latest , i have been told .
being a general , mr morillon will set a good example .
neither should the constant threat under which israeli child live be allowed .
is this risky solution acceptable , today , to israel ?
however , the israeli army is eradicating hamas by killing palestinian in gaza .
the extent of the military violence is huge and disproportionate .
any kind of peace is better than bloody conflict .
military violence must immediately give way and priority to a political solution .
the road to lasting peace lead only through political negotiation .
what about the innocent civilian , the non-combatants , woman and child ?
just entering into the classic blame game doe not help the civilian .
making call and resolution doe not help the civilian .
the son of those who were exterminated have become exterminator .
i believe that we need to tackle the situation properly .
i believe that the real loser are all of u .
we can not be bystander because that make u complicit in the slaughter .
it ha provided money and training for hamas fighter .
this is an issue of respect for international humanitarian law .
in parallel , the peace process itself must be driven forward rapidly .
our pain is at the enormous suffering of so many victim .
we need a marshall plan for the middle east .
i have not , to date , opposed the new eu-israel agreement .
i do not think it is yet time to do so .
in the last month , hamas still definitely behaved a a terrorist organisation .
but first of all they have to stop acting a a terrorist organisation .
we are in contact with the egyptian the whole time .
there wa a question on how we can assist in the region .
it is not for u to decide what we should give them .
they have to ask u and the european union .
that is the first task to be carried out .
i think it is a very good idea and we should follow it .
m ferrero-waldner and others mentioned what the mission achieved .
this basically deal with how to organise peace and what is necessary .
there wa a discussion about upgrading our relation with israel .
there are limit on our power to achieve something .
in that respect , we have achieved quite a lot .
mr president , israel state it is exercising it right to self-defence .
clearly , the eu alone can not resolve this .
but there is a white elephant in the room .
the world is waiting and the eu is a willing partner !
will you work with u to provide protection for all concerned ?
reawaken your basic humanity and you will see why hamas gain strength .
this is not the way to help israel or palestinian .
the force used must be proportional to the wrong endured .
unfortunately we have seen a large degree of carelessness by the israeli .
i think this is quintessential , and everyone agrees to this .
palestinian need urgent access to food , medical aid and security .
it is unfortunate that the un 's resolution ha been sidelined .
it is also regrettable that the eu still need to find a role .
is such action consistent with our own eu value of justice and democracy ?
mr president , i wa elected to this house 25 year ago .
this is probably the most important debate in which i have taken part .
( da ) mr president , i just want to say two thing .
it simply went and increased the rate of settlement .
minister schwarzenburg say that the european union can not do very much .
there ha been a definite violation of the principle of international law .
neither party to the conflict is interested in peace for the other party .
both party see only their own interest - that is national egotism .
international opinion is against the continuation of this war .
of course , we can pin all our hope on our commissioner .
at least , this is what we all want .
the withdrawal of israeli troop from all the occupied palestinian territory !
negotiation with hamas a it is are not possible .
world history show that the quest for peace pay off in the end .
i deplore that innocent civilian are used a human shield .
would that humanity could only see the futility of such war .
the eye-closers are also the one arming the killer of civilian .
a few day ago we commemorated the destruction of nagyenyed ( aiud ) .
we need cooperation between majority and minority on an equal footing .
there is a shortage of basic necessity such a drinking water and food .
gas supply by russia to ukraine and the eu ( debate )
the council and the commission were aware of the potential problem .
i personally already met russian official in prague two day before christmas eve .
the dispute is not over yet , a we all know .
the presidency is well aware of the number of problem which persist .
energy security is one of the top presidency priority .
furthermore the eu need to diversify it gas resource and supply route .
i think the community is prepared for the situation both politically and technically .
this directive established the gas coordination group , which now prof it value .
at the same time , i do not take side .
i do not want to blame one or the other party .
i believe that the measure that we have taken are sufficient .
the european union is led by the presidency and supported by the commission .
the solution is so easy if they would just talk to each other .
i have two question for the president-in-office and the commission .
secondly , what pressure instrument doe the eu posse ?
in my eye , 18 december wa perhaps a little too late .
i agree with much that ha been said here .
these thing will not happen overnight , but signal must be sent out .
yet these , too , will not just appear .
the same is true of the gas reserve , of course .
we have to make common cause in this regard .
we must emphatically underline that it is not purely economic in character .
i hope that the plan the commissioner ha presented will bear fruit .
there is now a need and a use for such people .
should we agree that the eu should start to boycott russian gas ?
we must also embark on a programme of building new nuclear power station .
and , unfortunately , it is being paid by the weakest .
it is the price of our fanatical rejection of nuclear energy .
we need to take action to safeguard security of supply .
what ha unfolded in recent week ha led to great surprise .
we are constantly receiving contradictory information about what exactly is going on .
little ha been done about this in recent year .
russia and ukraine have dealt themselves and their reputation heavy blow .
i think that this can not be hammered home enough to both party .
this situation doe throw up a number of question , of course .
many country of the european union are in a similar situation .
the issue then wa the northern gas pipeline from russia to germany .
however , we do not know the fact of the situation .
all we know is that we are dealing with frivolous organisation .
the situation is also evidence of the european union 's deficient energy policy .
the use of coal is opposed under environmental pretence .
slovakia 's gas is again stuck somewhere between the two warring party .
to put it briefly , two party - two truth , no gas .
how many time ha russia attracted attention in this regard ?
i think that mr swoboda wa right to ask this question .
what have we done to increase our support for nuclear power ?
the answer is far too little , far too timidly .
what have we done to get other permissible pipeline sorted out ?
what have we done in the field of lng ?
what ha been done in the field of external energy policy ?
we have the political capacity for that and we have need of cooperation .
the russian and ukrainian delegation should also be present .
it is a serious situation , a ha been said .
million of people are freezing and factory are being shut .
russia did the same when it cut off the eu gas section .
gas is flowing , however , through other transit country .
it is work for those in the pipeline industry .
- thank you very much for this final point .
nevertheless , many people are freezing in their own home .
in this war we are not hostage but combatant .
we are not mediator but one of the side having a legitimate interest .
this war extends it consequence from one crisis to another .
could we cease the combat and organise a peace conference ?
let u be united and negotiate strategically and comprehensively .
it seems that this doe not exist for our partner .
this implies much improved and extended grid and pipeline .
these gap in the gas grid must be closed , urgently .
what is the timing for this , commissioner piebalgs ?
we must put our own european interest first and without delay .
by this , i mean that europe need to call somebody to account .
we must be quicker and more efficient at shaping common energy policy .
both of these will result in our diversifying supply route and exporting country .
we have to interconnect the gas network within the eu .
we have to find solution to better streamline the national procedure .
the world is changing , and it simply need to accept this fact .
the citizen of ukraine should not suffer just because their politician have failed .
that is important above and beyond the immediate political side to this crisis .
( hu ) madam president , i suggest that we speak clearly .
madam president , i am glad to see mr vondra back .
you have to change your position on this line .
i think we are quite successful in doing that for the time being .
this is the debate about a third-country clause etc .
you need the right kind of a geological environment .
that is , at least , my own view .
so it is difficult - what can we do ?
i think a courageous person is one is willing to take a risk .
the most important thing is what we can do together in the future .
we have one problem and that is , of course , the treaty .
in the treaty there is no common external security policy .
secondly , for two year we have had energy diplomacy .
it is very difficult to get all the actor together at once .
we can normally only do the framework , for instance for nabucco .
there , i think that public-private partnership are necessary .
that is why i believe that no issue should be taboo any more .
and , to be honest , i never expected full disruption of supply .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday 15 january 2009 ) .
in fact , accelerating the nabucco project is vital .
the gas crisis spotlight two major problem which the european union is facing .
one of the glaring shortcoming come from the eu presidency .
a for oil stock we should develop gas storage .
the energy sector represents a major economic and geopolitical factor .
the truth is important , but it will not deliver gas .
let u use this opportunity to get serious answer to several question .
will we be able to draw the right conclusion from the present situation ?
will the ideological opponent of atomic energy change their view ?
energy solidarity requires cross-border connection joining the transmission network of individual country .
but the debate is very important , albeit inadequate .
the consequence of this crisis are humanitarian and economic .
we need a new action mechanism and set of tool .
we must start building the nabucco gas pipeline without delay .
in writing . - ( et ) madam president , honourable chairman .
i hope the spokesman is successful in strengthening that understanding .
the european union should never become a victim of such political behaviour .
if not , there is something wrong with integration .
the country that is being fought over now is ukraine .
russia ha joined in the election campaign that is underway there .
without technical coordination between the two side , gas can not be supplied .
we hope that the package will be adopted at second reading .
we need a common external policy in the energy sector .
the next item is question time ( b6-0001/2009 ) .
subject : the rule of law and the judicial system in russia
the eu need the new agreement , but so doe russia .
i wish that every member of this chamber could say the same thing .
one of these priority will be the european union in the world .
we are currently seeing the problem of energy dependence .
but it is not up to u to bring a legislative proposal .
one of the priority of the czech presidency is the common agricultural policy .
may i wish the czech presidency every success during it term in office .
( ro ) unfortunately , the economic crisis is leading to job loss .
quality of life also mean , however , healthy food .
so we have farmer with hugo bos tie now .
we did not have this five to ten year ago .
at the same time , we believe that the cap should be reformed .
this is the only way to keep europe competitive .
i know that parliament also keep abreast of development .
there are several source of tension in the horn of africa .
this is of course a major concern in the region .
once again , regional cooperation could mitigate the effect of these natural event .
piracy wa initially localised to a small part of the somali coast .
so what are the action which the european union undertakes ?
this particularly concern matter of governance and human right .
i look forward to hearing your proposal and recommendation on this particular issue .
firstly , let me say a word on ethiopia/eritrea .
ethiopia occupies a strategic economic and political place in the region .
on the situation in sudan , i fully share parliament 's analysis .
indeed , 2009 is a decisive year for the future of this country .
the deployment of the unamid must take place within the foreseen time .
in somalia , the peace process is in a crucial phase .
but they also provide an opportunity to launch an inclusive political process .
there is no plan b for the djibouti process .
the introduction is covered by a special rule and there are no limit .
the importance of this region transcends purely geographical bound .
this practice is illogical , and make diplomatic success practically impossible .
what we expect is a minimum acceptance of universal value .
we are also convinced that fundamental right and freedom belong to everybody .
human right , democracy and good governance are empty word .
that is perfectly obvious to anyone who doe not keep their eye closed .
they create humanitarian disaster and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region .
each war , each conflict accentuates the fragility of the state .
the power a well a the security vacuum must be filled .
if not , the stateless chaos known a somalia will remain .
the united nation put this figure at over twelve million .
we must all have a common interest in a successful operation atalanta .
his crime is stated a 'having reported independent news ' .
in this resolution , we have the first direct reference to dawit isaak .
this is a powerful step in the right direction .
now the commission and the council must also lend force to these word .
well , it wa working for democracy and for the freedom of speech .
mr president , the horn of africa is pretty much an unmitigated disaster .
human right are abused a a matter of course .
we have also debated the epidemic of piracy off the somali coast .
past experience suggests this would be a terrible mistake .
the people of somaliland benefit from a relatively benign government and progressive institution .
however , the international community equally bear responsibility with regard to these event .
anna-maria gomes asked about the recent arrest of the opposition activist mr bertukan .
she wa re-arrested at the end of the year .
then i would like to make five short concluding remark .
the vote will take place on thursday , 15 january 2009 .
the participation of belarus will depend on it domestic development .
we have seen some progress in the last three month .
this , however , will not be a one-way street .
we might also mention the future opening of a european union representation .
the ball , a they say , is in minsk 's court .
monk and nun are expelled , and the death penalty still exists .
we also need to raise the issue of worker 's right in belarus .
is this cause to turn our back on minsk again ?
but let u not push the le noble into the hand of moscow .
in october , we decided to suspend the entry ban for president lukashenko .
experience ha taught u that all dictatorship come to an end !
moreover , the several month ' trial period is drawing to a close .
almost every change in recent year ha taken place in a global context .
today we are experiencing a fundamental change in the situation .
the true value at stake are energy , money and military strategy .
the concrete step taken and planned by the eu are important .
it is not a liberal democracy in the european meaning of the word .
( pl ) mr president , eu-belarus relation depend on both side .
no democratic country can function without a strong civil society .
a visa facilitation agreement must be concluded between the european union and belarus .
i have said this repeatedly , and will say it again today .
let u reach out a european hand to welcome the belarusian people .
change is on it way , however , albeit very slowly .
however , this support must be made conditional on specific term and requirement .
these should include a requirement for greater medium freedom .
history ha proven that isolation and external sanction help maintain dictatorship .
the policy of sanction against belarus started out a a fiasco .
this is definitely a very simple gesture which president lukashenko could make .
it is time to make a summary of the discussion .
i call on deputy prime minister vondra to sum up .
i will now make perhaps three point in conclusion .
firstly , on visa fee , which many of you have mentioned .
this is a problem of which we are particularly aware .
we are aware that the general problem is far from being resolved .
so you are right - this is an important factor .
we are not yet at the point of having one general agreement .
that , again , would have to be negotiated by the commission .
the vote will take place on thursday 15 january 2009 .
alexander milinkievich 's opposition movement 'for freedom ' ha finally been registered .
belarus ha expressed willingness to participate in the eastern partnership .
even washington ha said that relation between the two country have improved .
ha the time come to warm relation and break the ice with belarus ?
it is obvious that belarus is playing on two front .
looking back , much more could have been done , and earlier .
srebrenica wa a collective failure of the international community , the eu included .
that is a great shame and we deeply regret this fact .
the eu will keep doing everything in it power to make this happen .
a lot of good endeavour have been carried out .
that would be the best possible tribute to the victim of srebrenica .
srebrenica stand a a symbol of horror and inconsolable grief .
war , concentration camp , genocide - never again !
we are all aware of the carnage that occurred in srebrenica in 1995 .
the surviving woman and child are right to keep reminding u of this .
kill me , and that will be the end for u . ” '
in other word , actual consideration for those who are left behind .
mine , mr stoyanov , is a real story from that time .
it is something i will never , ever forget .
we have that helplessness and hopelessness that we perhaps shared .
it is focused on the living and on a better future for them .
we all thought that safe haven would be safe haven .
therefore , we have much to do on this .
therefore , commissioner , i would like answer to these question .
the enforcement of law on long distance transport is not satisfactory .
the commission continues to support the best available option for improving the situation .
the commission agrees that enforceability is a key aspect of any proposed law .
commissioner , i would like to refer to two specific issue .
this prevents a comparison of the data reported by the various country .
this is something i would very much like to know .
it is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation .
we should not simply talk about a time limit .
i would like to know how this rest station project is progressing .
there is a lot of cruelty to animal during transport .
judging by how we treat our animal , we are still barbarian .
many of the discussion before we joined were about animal transport .
this wa an area in which we were to improve the situation .
five country have not even bothered to submit a report .
i demand that the commission fine these country immediately .
we need to revisit the condition for animal during transport .
that is how densely packed the animal are at present .
who would want to be transported under such condition ?
however , these long journey also result in poorer quality meat .
they result in a very real reduction in value .
no , we need a new proposal before the election .
we must take account of this when we lay down legislation .
more and more animal are being transported within the eu .
this wa when the eu comprised 15 member state .
you can only imagine what the figure will be with 27 member state .
they will , of course , be very much higher .
i would also like to ask mr špidla a couple of question .
i am also talking about the transportation of horse .
mr president , following that may not be easy !
do you have any proof , and if so , what ?
how are they monitored in the individual member state ?
how should this be organised , and who would provide such training ?
where must farmer show this in order to obtain their qualification ?
these question should be discussed and answered in further debate .
we urgently need a uniform solution and one which is uniformly implemented .
should we not make night-time transport obligatory in the latter case ?
i should be grateful if you would consider this proposal in the future .
that is an area we need to look at .
mr jensen spoke of 24-hours transport - not necessarily .
mr allister , the agricultural industry ha to ask question itself .
that would be in the interest of animal welfare and of human health .
secondly , monitoring remains the achilles ' heel of this legislation .
i would therefore like to urge the european commission to look into this .
i know the commission can access that , but individual can not .
i would like answer to those three specific question please .
i am delighted that this question ha been tabled .
they need detailed inspection , and lesson need to be learned .
guaranteeing the welfare of animal is something that is very important .
eu legislation on the transport of animal is strict .
we have to successfully reduce the transport of live animal for slaughter .
today , for example , i am concerned about the ... .
commissioner , have you received last june 's annual report from ireland ?
it is therefore important to respect prescribed principle and standard .
we should ass the situation in specific member state .
the citizen of the european union are very sensitive ... .
i would like to try and answer some specific question .
a total of six member state were inspected in detail in 2008 .
i wish to thank the commission for it effort .
firstly , the health of the world 's population will decline .
cattle produce methane , and that is bad for the global climate .
this is why it is so important to take this particular step .
produce must return to being natural and free from additive and chemical preservative .
the healthy basis of the diet is also undeniable .
recognition by unesco would encourage a definition to protect this particular diet .
over half of the population of the european union are overweight .
we should take action to combat this negative trend .
in my opinion , the location wa decided correctly and reasonably .
we will suspend the session for a few minute .
this is a good start to the year in our plenary sitting .
the sitting will resume at 12 noon for the vote .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
restoring ntdtv television broadcast to china via eutelsat ( written declaration )
the discussion wa very in-depth and very passionate , but also very thoughtful .
this is the last plenary sitting my colleague mr rocard will be attending .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
the eu is indeed much more united than people say .
there is no obligation on employer to produce plan .
secondly , i would like to stress the importance of priority .
we do not want their sacrifice to be in vain .
european must withdraw a quickly a possible from the afghan wasp ' nest .
i would like to express my support for aid to afghanistan .
the eu need to continue the support being given to afghanistan .
we have therefore decided to abstain on this report .
in writing . - ukip fully support equality for men and woman .
further legislation and bureaucracy imposed by the eu is therefore unnecessary .
civil society organisation also have an important role to play in this .
this gap narrowed by just 1 % between 2000 and 2006 .
trade union should play an important role in this field .
letter of formal notice have been sent to 22 member state .
some definition have been incorrectly transposed in 15 member state .
our own-initiative report is an alarm bell and a warning to member state .
unfortunately , exaggerated declaration and claim were passed in committee .
president pöttering ha been hasty in asserting that there were no vote against .
it is imperative that the european parliament express it view on the crisis .
it is precisely because of this that parliament can no longer remain silent .
that is why i voted in favour of this resolution .
unfortunately , there is no mention of this in the resolution .
the continuation of the military offensive is costing too many life .
lip service is insufficient in the face of such a severe humanitarian crisis .
the right of israel to exist in peace and security is inalienable .
the conflict between israel and gaza ha simply gone on too long .
no military solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict is possible .
in writing . - the situation in the gaza strip is deplorable .
yes , i accept israel should be allowed to live in peace .
yes , rocket attack across the border are unacceptable and should stop .
but the response by israel is totally disproportionate and can not be supported .
the israeli have failed to respect the international community .
they have shelled the un compound , they have attacked school and child .
israel : you have the right to live in peace .
your action mean that you have become the aggressor , not the victim .
the situation in the horn of africa continues to be extremely concerning .
the horn of africa is currently suffering from cumulative scourge :
legislation should also be changed and belarusian should be given freedom of movement .
or is it perhaps commercial consideration that stop u from doing this ?
this resolution is a step forward in reaffirming these value .
relation between the european union and belarus depend on both party .
there are , of course , good reason for this .
however , there are also good reason for many of belarus ' expectation .
some gesture from minsk justify a resumption of some relation .
it continued in europe with srebrenica and it continues today in gaza !
those in favour of military intervention will not enjoy hearing this criticism .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the debate on five motion for resolution on iran .
those who work there have been threatened , imprisoned and intimidated .
it ha often been asked what is the result of these protest .
this question should also be addressed to the council and the commission .
shirin ebadi 's persecution is not an isolated incident .
under the regime 's critic , she enjoyed a privileged position for year .
the majority of the victim of the theocratic regime in iran are unknown .
we can not tolerate such dreadful , abominable persecution of m ebadi .
we must defend the independence of the student movement in iran .
this is the sort of example that iran provides .
i think that more radical action need to be taken in this field .
at the moment , there is no sign of the situation improving .
this constructive criticism can only help relation between the european union and iran .
however , we can not introduce democracy or stability to iran .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
after independence in 1958 , firm tie were formed with the soviet union .
he promised to fight corruption and to organise election before 2010 .
should the coup d'état be condemned in these circumstance ?
yes , lady and gentleman , we have to condemn it !
the junta put a banker forward a it next prime minister .
the reaction from the outside world is one of confusion .
the west-african cooperative bloc , ecowas , ha condemned the latest coup d'état .
that country doe not need another dictator , but the restoration of democracy .
guinea 's only path to prosperity is through democratic , civilian government .
all this undoubtedly is of concern to the international community .
external pressure might force the junta to call democratic election .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the victor mainly belong to one major tribe , the kikuyu .
a food shortage and a new press law have made for renewed tension .
i hope that president kibaki will take our advice and change his mind .
two section effectively introduce direct medium censorship by the government .
these convention include the right to freedom of speech .
i hope that those responsible for these incident will be justly punished .
i hope that this process will be halted by international and internal action .
i think that president kibaki and prime minister odinga will take appropriate action .
today , we see similar intention behind the legislative endeavour in kenya .
that is no justification or explanation for this kind of censorship .
an attack against press freedom is an attack against democracy .
through the ill-considered action of president kibaki , these have now become law .
it is essential that the existing legal provision should be amended .
written declaration included in the register ( rule 116 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
( the sitting wa closed at 4.10 p.m . )
i declare resumed the session adjourned on thursday , 15 january 2009 .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
the report will therefore be put to the vote on thursday .
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
last year we witnessed uniformed policeman beating up civilian in slovakia .
we will shortly start the discussion on energy strategy .
almost every day one of them dy under the wheel of a juggernaut .
in making the decision , were their life considered at all ?
our new and former colleague martin kastler ha now arrived too .
he tell me he wa caught in a traffic jam .
handicapped citizen can not use these card in all eu member state .
home childcare must not be detrimental to public childcare service .
mr merkel ha once again proven her understanding of european solidarity .
this also applies to the 1.5-2 million hungarian in transylvania .
( hu ) thank you for the floor , mr president .
the latest information provocation is that georgia kidnapped a russian soldier .
the burgenland authority are not really speaking to u .
we request the commission 's assistance in this matter .
we are building a europe in which there is no room for nationalism .
only a share of eur 20 million earmarked from billion for project !
we acknowledge the fundamental right and freedom of european citizen .
the matter is currently at a standstill within the council of minister .
it is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
two year have passed and no progress ha been made .
in two day ' time , a palestinian will speak .
i am not trying to accuse anyone ahead of time .
there is also a substantial amount of infected pigmeat at one plant .
member state must gradually reduce their carbon dioxide emission .
( hu ) thank you very much , madam president .
respect for the right of these minority ha not yet been satisfactorily ensured .
around 30 to 40 million m3 of tree have been brought down .
for the united state there are real issue about particular sector .
for u , issue around service are very important and will follow on .
bilateral and interregional agreement can only be supplementary in nature .
i would say that to return to unilateral approach is not a solution .
in april or may there will be election in india .
we have one new administration in the united state .
the outcome of the indian election may give u another .
maybe a visit to the committee on international trade would prove appropriate .
if we are open , then they need to be open too .
that is why it is important to proceed with the multilateral doha negotiation .
madam president , the doha round broke down last year .
this sort of financial crisis result in a global depression .
the last time , it brought hitler to power .
these are important issue that we are talking about here .
president obama actually won the election from a protectionist platform .
if this process start it will not be possible to stop it .
the key to success lie in the agricultural sector .
this is the politics of small-minded self-interest instead of statesmanship .
in the financial service sector we are seeing protectionism increase very rapidly .
i would therefore like to ask the commission a question .
madam president , i should like to welcome the commissioner .
we are concerned about it , a we should be .
it should be an issue that is discussed at the doha level .
then we will be able to speak of equal competition .
there is an impression that european farmer are the only one with concern .
member will know that this is based on the 1979 trade act .
mr ford raised some of the issue about bilateral relation .
mr assis , protecting our interest , not protectionism , is absolutely right .
of course the sector is at the cutting edge of globalisation .
small and medium-sized enterprise play a huge part in this .
import from china have increased overall , but within reasonable limit .
the challenge for the sector predate the current slowdown .
we welcome parliament 's resolution on the future of the textile sector .
we would like to thank you for your reply to the oral question .
we must keep a close eye on matter and we must be responsive .
it is of crucial importance to the regional economy .
it is a sector that ha been particularly exposed to the globalisation process .
that is what we must be aware of , once and for all .
this would not simply be a consequence of the economic and financial crisis .
in fact , last year textile import from china went through the roof .
a we all know , the double-checking system is no longer in operation .
we are counting on you not to let this simply pas unchallenged .
that is not the only matter of concern , commissioner .
it is simply a matter of political will and coordination .
these change have been particularly dramatic for the region and family affected .
this is not at all a matter of promoting trade barrier .
what role will commercial policy play in this context ?
that is why a more open market is really the top priority .
that would naturally help to safeguard job a well .
for this is about the consumer , and not only about the commission .
i believe that it is probably wrong just to apply protective measure .
it is specifically designed to help small business address issue of defence .
'protect not protectionism ' is a very big theme of the discussion .
- the next item is the joint debate on :
the commission statement on the consequence of the recent gas crisis ;
concerning the gas crisis , what is the current state of play ?
i believe that we should not remain idle on this transit issue .
there were some case where solidarity could have been greater .
it is the part of the recovery package related to energy .
fourthly , we need to identify the best practice at international level .
then there is the long term , which is very important .
it is just a matter of translating word into action .
otherwise citizen in the member state will lose confidence .
the result is more realistic and persuasive than the original text .
great ambition have appeared and people like to hear them .
however , their fulfilment lie often beyond the border of reality .
these state were left in the lurch for year by simply making promise .
firstly , of course , at the level of ict product themselves .
we hope this work will be achieved by investing in research .
reducing the footprint of ict product also form part of this research .
thirdly , we need a new generation of binding energy interdependence clause .
this is why energy follows the economic trend of any given society .
the implementation of the nabucco project is exceptionally important in this regard .
in addition , we need to enrich our energy mix .
i would like to stress that efficient energy use is our priority task .
in conclusion , let me present my opinion on the amendment tabled .
there is still a lack of national strategy for tackling this problem .
the report emphasis the particular importance of energy saving and energy efficiency .
the coming week will be crucial in this respect .
my own personal opinion is that we do not need nuclear energy .
assurance should be sought , but notice should also be served .
this ha happened before , and it must not happen again .
the time ha come fundamentally to reassess europe 's energy supply .
that is the energy future that europe must champion .
firstly , i feel that the predicted trend in gas demand is restrictive .
mr laperrouze next recommended diversifying the source and route of supply .
finally , i would like to turn to external relation .
mr president , commissioner , solidarity is a lovely word .
it generally belongs to the vocabulary of the left .
harmonisation of the electricity network also mean harmonising the price of electricity .
in that case there will be loser : those country with cheap electricity .
this is the best way to counteract asymmetric market opening .
this would not appear to be the best way forward .
more clarity on this in the report would have been welcome .
a few day ago bulgaria wa facing an extremely serious energy crisis .
decreasing the use of fossil fuel mean le dependence on unreliable supplier .
i must also emphasise the issue of nuclear power .
united in diversity is the motto of the european union .
this show that the risk remains and is perhaps increasing .
in point of fact , the priority is plain for all to see .
there is nothing cheaper and nothing that will create more job .
thirdly , there is gas to tide u over .
i find that so contradictory and so utterly wrong .
not a penny for solar energy , and not a penny for biomass !
( c ) thank you , i shall be brief .
the recent gas crisis ha shown that this is an extremely important task .
the reactor met all the criterion for safe operation .
it may also show it passivity and risk marginalisation .
we need smart electricity grid ; currently these are wasteful and anachronistic .
we need consumption that is managed in accordance with production .
this would not be the case with smart grid .
in this way we could also cooperate with neighbouring country in the mediterranean .
this would be an excellent opportunity for cooperation on technology transparency .
we could promote a clean future for u all .
mr president , i should like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
investment in ukraine seems to be of special importance for u .
the reason for such a step on our part is very simple .
in term of energy relation , ukraine identifies with international standard .
let u finish the legislative procedure during the next three month .
a the problem are global , obviously global solution are what are needed .
luckily , smart technology ha developed at just the same time .
everywhere there is human activity , intelligence is needed to control energy consumption .
we find it odd that ukraine is a transit country .
another aspect relates to the development of liquefied natural gas terminal .
we are on the verge of an energy crisis and a financial crisis .
we could get a better handle on employment and energy .
the commission can make a significant contribution to this .
finally , i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
the baltic sea is one of our most sensitive inland sea .
firstly , the european union doe not have an energy strategy .
increasing number of expert and fact confirm that this is not true .
secondly , i am also grateful that the proposed position is so nuanced .
no , it is the private sector that will have to do that .
in any case , dependency on russia will for the most part remain .
more and more people are recognising the need for a paradigm shift .
here , unfortunately , we also need political will .
i called upon the european commission then to take firm action .
the second issue is the capacity for energy storage .
the second strategic energy review doe not give the desired added value .
telling child to turn thing off is just not the solution .
so , clearly , we have a particular problem .
in particular the issue of land use need to be addressed .
the commission 's proposal and mr laperrouze 's report point in this direction .
how are we working on nord and south stream , and on nabucco ?
i would like to address the following word to you , mr commissioner .
in ireland we have 12 day of gas supply at any one time .
the problem is that europe doe not have a unified market for gas .
finally there is the matter of the nabucco pipeline .
madam president , i have three question to commissioner piebalgs .
do you foresee any obstacle to that in the council ?
we do , however , also have our own energy source .
it is true that each of u see the detail differently .
there are no simple solution , no silver bullet to solve this .
supergrid is the tool that wa seen a a magical solution .
first of all there is the agency for cooperation of european regulator .
second , a european body for transmission system operator .
one is whether we should give public fund to energy at all .
the second issue is 'a fair return for my country ' .
on nabucco , our preferred option is definitely transit via turkey .
if it fails , we will look for alternative .
again i would like to thank you for this debate .
we have already , thanks to european research , gone one step forward .
then energy efficiency will not only be about speech but also about fact .
the difference of course relate to the composition of the energy mix .
i wish to say that we do need to be careful .
there ha been a great deal of exaggeration in what ha been said .
i believe that we have set some very ambitious target for 2050 .
thus , nuclear energy is part of the mix , and coal too .
the vote on mr laperrouze 's report will take place tomorrow .
energy matter are the greatest challenge of our time .
the eu must take additional step so that the crisis is not repeated .
obviously this wa a political shot in the foot .
the eu need to break out of it own vicious circle at last .
this mistaken standpoint can only lead to erroneous consequence !
this is about much , much more than energy !
linking the network will also stimulate competition in the region .
these are matter about which there is no disagreement .
the interference of political motif is too visible to overcome naivety .
the report is not ambitious enough a regard renewable energy source .
we must take measure to diversify our energy source and supply route .
development impact of economic partnership agreement ( epa ) ( short presentation )
'economic partnership agreement ' really is quite a mouthful , particularly in german .
most of the regional and national programme are signed .
the commission recognises the essential role of development finance .
this includes fiscal reform and change to revenue system .
another essential objective is to support regional economic integration in the acp .
the interim agreement do not yet include all acp country .
this is exactly why these agreement are only temporary pending full agreement .
the commission 's view is that protectionism is never a valid policy option .
these are the condition that would make the epa acceptable agreement .
unfortunately we are still a long way away from them .
there is a dual perception of wilderness in european culture .
thus we must protect nature , but by mean of human use .
a part of this site is located within the territory of neighbouring slovakia .
it is quite literally a question about the future of life on earth .
it is also important to add one clarification to the report .
most of these area are already a part of the natura 2000 network .
a conference will take place in prague in may 2009 .
for this reason , the commission considers the european parliament resolution timely .
it represents a very welcome input into the prague conference .
i really do feel we need to urgently revisit this rule .
you should also refer to your group chairman , lady and gentleman .
in writing . - wilderness can mean different thing to different people .
i welcome and support this report on europe 's wilderness area .
these park are part of the protected area network ( pan ) .
directly or indirectly , it generates 154 000 job across europe .
the third point concern the problem of access to airport and airspace .
it invests substantially in research and development , and is growing fast .
general and business aviation mainly comprises small and medium-sized enterprise .
here a well , proportionality will be an important principle to follow .
it is obvious that this initiative is worthy of full support .
this is true of commercial air transport and business and general aviation .
small and medium-sized airport are crucial for both general and business aviation .
their establishment and modernisation should be promoted and member state encouraged to invest .
the aim must be nothing le than emission-free air traffic .
non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity ( short presentation )
unfortunately , this contribution is not included in national statistic and account .
restricting the concept of inter-generational solidarity to just childcare is a mistaken interpretation .
human resource manager agree that human capability are comparable to university degree .
this is why this report is devoted mainly to them .
economist use mathematical model to highlight the value of housework .
ignoring this fact mean maintaining the idea of the past .
we would like to congratulate parliament on the very important work done .
that being said , your comment is obviously noted .
one of the field in which woman are hugely underrepresented is scientific research .
this work often go ignored by policy maker and society a a whole .
today 's europe is faced with unprecedented demographic change .
caring ha been the domain of woman for century .
this work is reflected in the gdp if a family employ someone .
that is where the whole mission of pre-commercial procurement come in .
what are the next concrete step we will have to take ?
i think that the recovery package would be a good place to start .
we can only make a difference if we work together .
thank you very much for giving a helping hand here .
public procurement is a strategic instrument to achieve this goal .
( the sitting wa closed at 11 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9.05 a.m . )
combating the sexual exploitation of child and child pornography ( debate )
we therefore need to roll it out across all 27 member state .
it is a terrible phenomenon whose scale is unknown .
the european union ha armed itself with legislation on the issue .
i must say that i am not satisfied either .
the suggestion contained in the report will help u to implement this proposal .
it is important for u to make definite progress in this area .
in this field there is a lot to do .
we can only combat this abuse successfully by attacking it at the root .
it is our obligation to give the best possible protection to our child .
however , the protection also ha to involve the child themselves .
i should like to congratulate mr angelilli on this lucid report .
the explosive increase in criminal activity via the internet requires a coordinated approach .
we must therefore fight to prevent such act using all available mean .
member state must do everything possible to eliminate demand entirely .
at the same time , several national law constrain surveillance .
there have also been such case in other member state .
we must be able to protect our child before they become victim .
there have even been attempt to form paedophile political party .
this must fill every decent citizen of the european union with horror .
that is why i am strongly in favour of the report .
i think we will all support such a report .
unfortunately , this is what is going on on the internet .
it is a crime and should be treated a such .
it is regrettable that some member state have yet to sign this convention .
prophylactic and preventative measure are needed in this area .
rapid crime detection and strict enforcement of penalty are imperative .
indeed , there are even specious notion about so-called 'good paedophilia . '
provision also need to be made for improving the living condition of victim .
perhaps our child are more proficient in using the new technology .
perhaps it is difficult to get them away from their computer .
dear parent , do something today to protect your child .
i mentioned that the home is sometimes the most dangerous place for child .
we had a recent case in ireland which highlighted this .
they should not be in conflict : both deserve protection from our constitution .
( bg ) mr angelilli 's report is very timely and important .
however , the introduction of criminal responsibility for such act is not sufficient .
i thank mr angelilli for a very important and well prepared report .
the age limit for sexually motivated crime should also be harmonised .
it will be easier to carry out investigation and bring charge .
in particular , the access provider have to be mobilised .
it will set about locating and confiscating the profit made from criminal activity .
i would like to take this opportunity to make a few additional point .
indeed , grooming child must be considered an offence .
in that regard , i urge the eu to take the lead .
in writing . - exploiting child in any way is unacceptable .
nevertheless , signing and ratifying convention is merely providing a framework for improvement .
the implementation of the council 's framework resolution is also important .
what is taking place on the internet ha surpassed all limit .
child are often unable to understand the seriousness and consequence of a situation .
what often seems to be a game can lead to lifelong psychological damage .
this , however , is a struggle against consequence .
in order to prevent crime , one must increase awareness .
sanction against employer of illegally staying third-country national ( debate )
i wa not one of those who supported it .
article 10 is , in my view , the key article .
i think the additional sanction laid down in article 8 are important .
we have included temporary work agency in the scope of the directive .
the commission can , however , support this compromise without hesitation .
my thanks go to parliament , mr fava and the libe committee .
there is a view that this legislation will not bring added value .
some of these will be decided when it come to their implementation .
indeed , the debate on legal migration is being held elsewhere .
a ever , though , this is about effective monitoring .
what exactly did we achieve by way of this law ?
a of now , this will be absolutely impossible .
claudio fava deserves our congratulation on this in particular .
that is why the application of the directive will also require special attention .
this pressure is considerable , and rightly so , frankly .
this is , quite frankly , unacceptable , in my view .
madam president , the european union is not coping with illegal immigration .
we have no guarantee that member state will ensure that people are paid .
there is thus no guarantee that payment will be made .
it is clearly a problem that ha been over-exaggerated .
these are worker who often do job not performed by eu citizen .
with this directive , the exploited pay more than the exploiter .
they go straight from being exploited in illegal work to being expelled .
i believe we are fostering this kind of xenophobic attitude with this directive .
i am afraid it will get quite a lot worse .
the prospect of british taxpayer funding foreign worker is , frankly , unacceptable .
the big concern now is whether the xenophobic far right will benefit .
we are not protectionist , but we want good common sense .
applying these law also help to identify the employment of illegal immigrant .
that , therefore , is our reason for wholly welcoming this directive .
case of slave labour occur , under condition of exploitation and child labour .
illegal employment play a significant role in reducing standard of employment .
responsibility for this rest squarely with member state government and authority .
i am not in favour of including criminal law within europe 's remit .
instead , an open method of coordination is what is needed here .
there is also the hypocrisy of the so-called individual regularisation on humanitarian ground .
it is therefore not enough to tackle the employer .
we must address illegal immigration in it entire context .
i therefore agree with combating illegal work across the european union .
however , there is one thing that i do not understand .
we have already seen this in the case of many report and action .
this is why we will be voting in favour of this report .
it represents the first step in the right direction .
illegal employment must be penalised and prohibited in all member state .
now we should go the rest of the way together .
at long last , the employment of illegal immigrant ha been criminalised .
multiple , balanced and realistic sanction are provided for in the directive .
i trust that they will prove to be effective .
it wa no easy task and the path wa strewn with pitfall .
many of them die on their way to our continent .
this will reduce the chance of finding a decent life in europe .
we have a four-party government with strong liberal element .
furthermore , unregistered worker do not benefit from health insurance or pension right .
we need to be firm , to send out a clear message .
the adoption of this text will indeed send out two clear signal .
we must therefore make every effort to implement this directive .
someone is making a good profit out of them .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work .
we must also ensure that this kind of behaviour is appropriately punished .
we need to draw up legislation which is equal to this complexity .
these sector use illegal labour to an alarming degree .
even romanian are facing numerous abuse by employer within the european union .
this measure therefore come at just the right moment .
these sanction will further deter employer from hiring worker .
the growth of illegal work seriously undermines economic competition .
the employer would not be in a position to provide the relevant evidence .
i would therefore like to reiterate my serious concern about this provision .
the provision may well turn out to be useless .
in fact , rather than interfering , it actually put thing in order .
then we could all agree that this is a good directive .
we are , however , only interested in legal residence and legal employment .
illegal foreign worker mean budgetary loss and distort healthy competition between enterprise .
the employer benefit most from the effort of illegal worker .
it seems to me to be a good first step .
thank you a well for the quality of this debate .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 4 february 2009 .
it doe not even consider the reintroduction of check at internal border .
action against illegal immigration and illegal residence should serve a a deterrent .
the statistic on the number of illegal worker in the union are alarming .
close cooperation is undoubtedly needed in order to combat illegal immigration .
despite it shortcoming , the project under debate merit commendation .
it is true that employer bear responsibility for illegal employment .
extension of the ec-usa agreement for scientific and technological cooperation (
request for waiver of the immunity of miloslav ransdorf (
we need to understand what we are voting on .
of course , in this context we recognise other model .
it is clear then , mr zaleski : we note that they exist .
combating the sexual exploitation of child and child pornography (
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
another key issue is tourism in it broadest sense .
we have a responsibility to nature to use land properly .
this aspect is particularly important at a time of recession .
the proposed certification procedure for third country seems a reasonable solution .
our response to it must be based on solidarity .
the rapporteur suggests relaxing the union 's policy towards the russian federation .
mr queiró 's report ha addressed that in it fullest .
we do not want the european union to be a massive airport structure .
the prejudice of the last century are deepening the demographic crisis .
i wa in favour of the position put forward by mr záborská .
mr president , thank you for your patience and indulgence .
i do not want to vote against the czech presidency .
likewise , the misuse of the internet drew the wrath of many .
cooperation in the field of science and research is extremely important .
however , it must be used for civilian purpose .
it trouble me that the present agreement once again contains no such provision .
however , the russian federation must observe these agreement and standard international regulation .
benefit which we can work towards are specifically and generally a positive .
most area in europe which are wilderness are protected under natura 2000 .
there are several reason why europe should be interested in protected wilderness area .
there are also many specie that have not yet been discovered and described .
then there are many purely ethical reason for preserving wilderness area in europe .
of course , this can not be done without defining wilderness .
therefore , i urge the european commission to take action in this field .
the same precept demand that intervention and regulation be balanced and considered .
moreover , the ethical reason for this decision must not be forgotten .
there is a difference between the notion of conservation and protection .
the territory in question are of particular and exceptional value .
it is therefore a sub-sector that need support and sensible regulation .
this communication point to a path for developing future policy .
this can be altered through what is known a pre-commercial procurement .
the u public sector spends usd 50 billion on research and development procurement .
the problem is a result of what is known a exclusive development .
it will allow a specific approach which involves risk benefit sharing .
this will also result in cost-effective development of innovative solution .
the key to this process is in the title : driving innovation .
this is most unfortunate if we really want to strengthen our innovative potential .
the gps satellite navigation system and semiconductor technology are but two example .
pre-commercial procurement also represents an important opportunity for smes .
for smes , public procurement represents a valuable opportunity to gain experience .
these decision should be made at member state level .
there is a probability that malta ha fossil-fuel reserve beneath it seabed .
the issue of nuclear energy ha once again taken a prominent position .
we do not have a single european energy policy .
energy link are investment which do not reap many reward financially .
therefore , such vitally important project should be financed with eu fund .
however , we voted in favour of several proposal .
far earlier than anticipated , i am being proved right .
everyone is aware that energy is a major challenge for the member state .
that is why we have voted against this report .
the tbc and nabucco project are affecting the political stability of our neighbour .
a it stand currently , i am voting against this report .
the debate on the strategic energy review is no exception .
alongside energy efficiency , energy-saving measure are of key importance .
in this report , the significance of nuclear energy is overrated .
an investment in the eu grid ha to be addressed .
the concept of 'work ' ha to be given a wider interpretation .
the definition of work to this day is too economic .
i voted in favour of the report by mr záborská .
running a home and bringing up child is largely unseen work .
there are some six million woman in poland who are homemaker .
moreover , 76.5 % of part-time worker are woman .
we must do everything that we possibly can to achieve gender equality .
to that extent , the rapporteur is , of course , right .
there are also wording that open the way for a common tax policy .
this example should become the accepted approach throughout europe .
we need more job which are suitable for older people .
equal pay for equal work is something which is long overdue .
it is not enough to call for solidarity between the generation .
the report wa unanimously approved in the committee on woman 's right .
even the green group did not vote against it .
the entire left-wing spectrum in the european parliament voted for the alternative resolution .
it wa definitely a step in the wrong direction .
every effort should therefore be made to combat it at international level .
the fight against the dissemination of child pornography must be prioritised .
we conservative therefore voted in favour of the report .
the internet is a vital part of our interconnected information society .
mr angelilli 's report is worthy of our support .
therefore , we voted in favour of the angelilli report today .
i therefore voted in favour of the angelilli report today .
criminal law is an absolutely crucial part of a sovereign state 's competence .
i have therefore voted against the report a a whole .
in romania , there is still a great deal unknown about this issue .
we have little data about how extensive it is .
our child must be given the best possible protection .
we must do everything possible to protect them from harm .
this is how they fall prey to dangerous temptation .
the solicitation of child for sexual purpose should be seen a a crime .
in addition , indecency offence involving child should fall within extra-territorial criminal legislation .
this protection doe not apply only to the internet .
parent play a special role in protecting their child against sexual abuse .
the education given by parent includes education on responsible use of the medium .
the internet can never replace time spent in dialogue between parent and child .
a computer game can not replace talking to one 's grandmother .
we must also put an end to sex tourism .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
i will therefore speak on her behalf and on my own .
the european union ha already shown it opposition to guantánamo .
we are examining the issue around how third country might receive former detainee .
at present , the u ha not made a formal request .
a mr ferrero-waldner repeatedly say , positive cooperation is required .
this is a positive obligation resulting from the european convention on human right .
it ha to be said that investigation have begun in several member state .
i have also approached romania about this issue of secret detention .
parliament ha also requested an assessment of national anti-terrorist legislation .
there is now a need to throw real light on all these reply .
firstly , he ended the cia secret detention programme .
this is why the council ha also warmly welcomed this decision .
i am sure that it is equally warmly welcomed by this parliament .
this is the question which we must ask ourselves today .
some people allege that the prisoner have been tortured .
this is a reason for accepting them , under the dictate of humanity .
however , is that the only aspect which we have to consider ?
we have a duty to protect european citizen against potential terrorist .
we have not yet done this , for good reason .
this is the first article in our charter of fundamental right .
the charter doe not state that this inviolability can be reduced .
after september 11 , though , nothing is standard any longer .
every ninth person of those released from guantánamo ha immediately resumed terrorist activity .
we are certainly bound to remove our citizen and resident from the camp .
we are also required to effectively isolate individual who represent a serious threat .
would you ask the u now who the inmate are ?
we are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse-trading .
the u military base at guantánamo must also be removed .
they should be tried and acquitted or convicted , released or punished .
those who are not convicted should be treated a innocent .
finally , we should not be fixated on guantánamo .
you should raise the matter again when mr pöttering is in the chair .
can we be asked to take that risk in the eu ?
member state have shown different degree of willingness to take former inmate .
perhaps he thought that it wa an amusement park .
we ask : and what about the citizen ' right to know ?
two year ago , parliament addressed 46 recommendation to the council .
i just want to deal with a couple of thing .
we know of two who have become involved in terrorism .
member of the now dissolved temporary committee on cia affair took the floor .
my hope and wish is for this to be the case .
and this is why we must insist they be held accountable .
the american people have done so through the poll .
if there is proof against any of them , they should be tried .
if there is no proof , then they must be released .
in legal term , i think the issue is clear .
there is no shortage of these in the united state of america .
i believe this is the case for most people here .
( nl ) president obama ha kept his word .
yet it is clear that we did not create it ourselves .
this is a clear duty that we should carry out .
there is no doubt that each case must be dealt with individually .
they are people with right , but also with their own personal story .
what are the figure for spain , italy or any other member state ?
will europe be able to reform the control of it own secret service ?
i welcome mr barrot 's declaration of intent to this end .
i would not wish obama enthusiast to suffer any early disappointment .
not one european government , not one national parliament , ha invited u .
( ro ) combating terrorism is the number one priority of modern society .
the right to the presumption of innocence must apply in this case .
proactive thinking on human right is regrettably selective in the eu .
guantánamo should never have been created and it needed to be closed .
the position of the european parliament on terrorism is equally clear .
it wa a huge mistake to treat detainee a they did .
it wa a huge mistake to transport them a they did .
europe need to feel responsible for the war on global terrorism .
no mean deemed inadmissible under signed international convention may be used .
the chechen nation wa murdered before our very eye .
i refer to a polish citizen aged 42 who wa kidnapped .
he wa seized in the border area between afghanistan and pakistan .
he ha been held in the area ever since .
now , we should not have to be asked about accepting guantánamo detainee .
cohesive leadership is now needed from the irish government in this regard .
moreover , internal investigation have not supported the accusation either .
at the most , it is simply cynical manipulation for obscure purpose .
some of them have not even been charged and duly tried .
it closure is now a matter for the united state .
torture is unacceptable and there are no exceptional circumstance to alter this truth .
the martin report is the best example of this approach .
it contains accusation against romania which are both controversial and unfounded .
europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take united action .
we joined the fight against terrorism to defend human right .
one the one hand , there is the legal position .
graham watson spoke of the need to approach this with one voice .
it is not about washing ourselves but not getting wet .
so there is an internal imperative for a coordinated approach .
i think we should be aware that the discussion ha only just begun .
mr president , the commission broadly share the view expressed by mr vondra .
it is a key turning point in the fight against terrorism .
terrorism must be combated vigorously , but human right must still be respected .
no one ha been able to prove their existence in romania .
both the romanian authority and public opinion strongly uphold respect for human right .
may the eu be ashamed of it failure to act .
this pressure is particularly great along the union 's southern and eastern border .
all party stand to gain by such an approach .
you have specifically raised the situation on the island of mayotte and lampedusa .
our asylum and migration policy is thus rooted in the rule of law .
it ensures respect for human right and for the dignity of the individual .
we are , of course , talking here about asylum seeker .
those are the remark i wished to make to you .
yes , you heard correctly , i said 30 % of the population .
the french authority are well aware of these difficulty .
today , we have spoken about the closure of guantánamo .
most of those who are in lampedusa are asylum seeker .
1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the mediterranean .
the urgency is great , and ha been for a while .
the european union is falling short , and not just by a little .
after the electoral campaign , i shall bring them to his attention .
i fear that this especially applies to your statement , mr vondra .
it is something that is included in your press release .
the citizen of lampedusa have become aware of this , mr muscardini .
i have prepared a dossier and sent it to mr barrot .
parliament report regarding the reception situation appear to be completely ineffective .
i would therefore call on the council presidency to make this a priority .
the detention centre wa not built to cope with this capacity .
i am sorry that he is not here in the house .
i believe that it is important to give you a few figure .
in 2007 , around 11 000 migrant arrived in lampedusa .
in 2008 , three time a many arrived , about 31 000 .
after the assertion that have been made , be patient .
the citizen are not annoyed with the italian government .
they are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
the detention condition are degrading and an affront to human dignity .
what therefore should be done : ignore the rule ?
those who come normally present themselves a asylum seeker .
when that happens , we must preserve the rule of law .
we must treat these people a free citizen and with respect .
what we are talking about now seems very strange to me .
this is important work at both domestic and international level .
that is to say , those who qualify are accepted .
of course , we in the european union must show solidarity .
all asylum seeker and all minor have already been transferred to appropriate centre .
the 2 000 arriving in lampedusa over christmas is nothing compared to this !
let me start with the negative - the limitation .
now is the time to gradually implement that step by step .
the next item is question time ( b6-0006/09 ) .
it will introduce fair and transparent procurement rule applicable throughout the union .
economic interest , by contrast , are not sufficient .
the vast majority of member state and parliament agreed with this assessment .
the defence directive doe , however , offer alternative to offset .
the commission welcome the recent cessation of hostility in gaza .
trading relation between the eu and israel will continue .
when will a breach of human right occur if not in these circumstance ?
a lot of people have asked for further supplementary question on this question .
who is eligible to apply to take part in the programme ?
the commission is convinced that the next one will also be a success .
it facilitates national action and initiative in a coordinated fashion .
the 2009 work programme is currently subject to commission inter-service consultation .
the commission will then seek the programme management committee 's favourable opinion .
doe the commissioner have any information on this and what exactly is contemplated ?
in essence , this mean that everything ha become much more interactive .
the safer internet programme is one response to threat already identified .
therefore , i think it would also be good for those enterprise .
subject : special adviser richard boomer and the heysel site
which decision by the commissioner ha mr boomer influenced ?
which internal meeting in the commission ha mr boomer attended since the extension ?
will the commission give it opinion on this site ?
all information about him is available on the website .
i am sorry about the long answer but the detail were also substantial .
i have produced a diagram which show the career of your special advisor .
so how do you ensure that no conflict of interest occur ?
i am absolutely sure that there is no conflict of interest .
he ha not expressed any kind of suggestion concerning our future policy decision .
i am absolutely sure you will hear when this decision is taken .
i have read in newspaper about some suggestion made .
( de ) i would like to query something again .
it will be a very clear and transparent decision .
we already have some building and some site outside the european quarter .
in the united state , to counterfeit the currency is a serious crime .
do we take the same attitude in the european union ?
there is a special spending programme , which ha it own legal basis .
next come implementation , where there are different layer .
this quantification of change also show that there ha been an improvement .
but we can also clearly say that this is far from perfect .
this is a huge machine which must work smoothly .
can we expect that this is going to be improved ?
all these sample have been corrected , recovered and the necessary document provided .
therefore , the 12 % issue from 2006 is resolved .
meanwhile , the court of auditor ha submitted this discharge , this report .
this would provide a model of efficiency for using european public money .
concerning the fund , i did not understand the question .
were you suggesting that all the fund should be merged ?
vice-president of the commission . - that is a huge question .
i can only pas this question to my colleague .
so far , it ha been a very heated debate in the council .
there are some opportunity to support energy efficiency through the cohesion fund .
the idea , of course , i can only support .
so we will try , of course , to have this multilateral approach .
subject : the removal of the pmoi from the eu 's terrorist list
let me make it clear that i condemn terrorism in all it form .
that seems to me to be a good step .
we could not have imagined discussing the potential radical change in eu-iceland relation .
such a move would not have a positive impact on eu-iceland relation .
the negotiation will be the same a with all other candidate country .
vice-president of the commission . - these are both quite specific question .
concerning the fishery agreement , again , this is a very specific question .
i think this will be the key element in future negotiation .
these are described in the attached survey of individual country .
you talk about the need of an ageing population .
i would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that .
finally , carers work : they are unpaid worker .
this is one of the reason why we are aiming in this direction .
the task is simply too difficult and they can not cope .
a the author is not present , question 51 lapse .
since then , the union ha set up instrument for achieving that goal .
this cooperation between member state ha had very good result .
the renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination .
we can not sweep these problem under the carpet !
the citizen of europe expect u to provide genuine answer .
the copenhagen criterion are aimed specifically at candidate for accession to the union .
the union ha also acted concerning the situation of the rom minority .
it can not abandon minority at this time of crisis .
some , like myself , a a swedish-speaking finn , are treated well .
immigrant require special support to help them integrate into their new homeland .
this parliament should approve a statement on the right of minority .
i believe that the rom need more support from the state .
however , in many country , this respect is weak or non-existent .
in those school , slovak is taught for four hour a week .
in the hungarian minority school , the language of instruction is exclusively hungarian .
slovak is taught a a supplementary language for a few hour each week .
many of them feel that they are stepchild within their own homeland .
your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle .
you should either love your receiving country or get out .
a specific mention must be made about the rom minority .
the commission doe not even apply the criterion properly during the accession process .
( hu ) thank you very much , mr president .
eskerrik asko jaun-andreok zuen laguntzagatik europako hizkuntza guztien alde .
real-life example show that solving issue related to education fuel strong community development .
education is , by it own nature , unifying rather than divisive .
let me give you the example of sapientia university in romania .
these traditional national minority are the most loyal citizen of their respective country .
there are several other member state besides romania that have similar concern .
for this reason , we need positive discrimination in certain situation .
we hope for protection of right for group : that is our goal .
we are talking here about a community of more than 100 000 romanian .
this would be the second church for romanian living in serbia .
( fr ) mr president , i have two question for the commissioner .
thirdly , mr beazley raised the question of double standard .
mr tabajdi ha just listed a whole raft of problem .
that is a much a i am able to say .
no country in contemporary europe denies the right of minority .
it appears that europe is of one mind on this .
this ha happened , for example , to pole in germany .
germany is thereby violating the fundamental right of minority .
clearly , these individual have the right to their own culture and language .
voting right for non-citizens of latvia in local election ( debate )
we have examined specific case in the committee on petition .
i only have this country and i can not vote . '
is this situation good or bad for the european union ?
this is a question for the commission and council .
today , the reality is that they are co-official .
it is up to the member state to decide such issue .
the reality is that the european union is made up of many state .
one of the largest migrant community in ireland is british .
they can all vote in local election in ireland .
such a position is also in line with international law and practice .
the majority of latvia 's business belong to russian entrepreneur .
the latvian population wa then subjected to imprisonment , deportation and execution .
there wa a palestinian exile who took latvian citizenship .
of course we are reminded that the great majority have taken citizenship .
( hu ) i wish to congratulate alexandra dobolyi and her fellow author .
this is the only solution , there is no other .
latvia 's citizenship law is one of the most generous in europe .
compulsory schooling involves learning the language of the country and possibly other language .
this is the purpose served by a good compulsory schooling system .
mr president , i have listened carefully to both side .
( the sitting wa closed at 10:55 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9 a.m . )
that ha been the greatest advantage of this committee .
we have stated that we do not have any super weapon .
if we understand that , then this task ha been worthwhile .
the copenhagen conference is now only 10 month away .
your report ha therefore come along at the right time .
nonetheless , i believe that agreement will be reached in copenhagen .
one illustrative element is the measure announced recently for car .
the commission ha proposed a series of criterion for defining comparability .
all these area deserve our full attention and an effective solution .
we need to address employment , income aspect and energy poverty .
we want retraining programme for the new green poll worker .
intervention to support bank and business should at least have a sustainable component .
this is usually not something we discus when we talk about the climate .
our fifth core theme , finally , is about involving people .
with this set of measure , there is also reason for optimism .
why doe china need a new coal-fired power station every week ?
we need to slow and reverse our population growth .
our refusal to place it there is the greatest folly .
government should be setting target for population stability or reduction .
we need to reduce bureaucracy and support smes and technology developer .
bank and funders will have to take risk on green technology start-ups .
there will be long-term gain if we step up to the mark .
we have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the atlantic .
we have the expertise in situ and we have the legal target framework .
we have the opportunity now , so let u use it .
i would like to mention three thing in particular .
a large proportion of this feed is exported to europe a soya .
a huge investment in public transport and other environmentally-friendly transport is needed .
should we not encourage local production and consumption instead ?
therefore , please vote against amendment 12 and 28 .
we should not , therefore , get too bogged down by short-term event .
we need tough goal for the period between 2020 and 2050 .
not one section of society should escape making effort .
this report make a particularly valuable contribution towards this .
today we are told there is a consensus around catastrophic man-made global warming .
the latest set of measure wa the recently approved energy package .
the only way we can be really effective is to improve efficiency .
i would , however , like to focus on the content .
it is somewhat too eurocentric and somewhat too compartmentalised a well .
we are failing in not bringing sufficient ambition to this debate .
we are failing in not bringing enough urgency to this debate .
today , we speak of renewables and energy efficiency .
these reduction target can not be met without serious diminution in food production .
twenty per cent by 2020 wa a start - but only a start .
we hear that a meeting will take place on 6 march 2009 .
we need to move on to shipping and to agricultural emission .
they will be devastated , but they did not cause this problem .
they must take action , but they need our help .
i may be wrong about the possible flu pandemic .
i may be wrong about the probable impact of global warming .
that lead to credible result , a we can see .
we have , however , lacked the financial instrument .
- ( sv ) this report promise a great deal .
no measure are proposed with regard to the protection of land and soil .
alternative fuel are also treated with far too much restraint .
it is , of course , possible to create job in europe .
we need to anchor the measure in economic policy .
we must create a basis for development in the field of energy .
i should like to thank karl-heinz florenz for his report .
the report before u is long ; it make many point .
so we have to get this package of measure right .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
- madam president , we have here an ambitious plan .
this simple statement wa the first to be attacked and removed .
i do not want discus the detail of this report .
in my opinion , it should simply be adopted .
that is the assumption behind mr florenz 's report .
that is what is most important to u today .
we must urgently find mean of fighting global warming .
unfortunately , the german liberal can not give their support to this .
you need to draw a graph showing how co2 perhaps cause warming .
we are nearly on the flat line , if not already there .
madam president , i would like to thank mr florenz .
this is a rich report with a great number of concrete proposal .
we can control emission but we can not control these factor .
that is why some of u advocate very strongly the 350 ppm target .
i would have liked it to be at the core of the report .
finally , let me just endorse what guido sacconi said .
this report call for an integrated approach that also hang together territorially .
this is the right approach , in my view .
a such , this approach can count on my backing .
there is also massive uncertainty which mean that security is so important .
however , we must also look to the future .
corresponding application were rejected by the majority , and that wa that .
science is only what fit into the political concept .
the fight against climate change can not be waged by europe alone .
we must also get other continent and country on board .
when we talk about adaptation measure then we are also talking about funding .
it is important not to give up on such a complex problem .
let u make sure that the member state make a solid commitment .
yet , there is something we should be worried about .
2009 is a european election year , when the european commission will change .
it is a way of reducing energy bill , which will please consumer .
every initiative we have launched must be speeded up .
a common european airspace , a single european sky and our management system .
above all , we must deal with our city and other difficult area .
ultimately , this is perhaps the most difficult task .
agriculture is often depicted a the big cause of climate change .
this show that agriculture should not be depicted a an environmental villain .
finally , i would like to say the following .
our greatest challenge now is to establish the next international climate treaty .
- madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
therefore we need to integrate policy on a horizontal and vertical plane .
without this we are left to triviality and the mundane .
the transport sector must reduce co2 emission by 20 % by 2020 .
in france , we speak of a 'théodule committee ' .
we had a lot of expert in the committee , that is true .
unfortunately , however , they represented only one view .
we did not get the chance to hear all side of the debate .
it make no sense constantly to resort to new regulation and new measure .
in my opinion , we have a very good starting point in 2009 .
the enormous value of this wa brought home to me in bali .
denmark obviously ha an enormous interest in the success of the copenhagen conference .
because we will save money on energy through energy-saving measure .
the second option will be possible only through decentralised renewable electricity .
this is an enormous political task facing u in relation to developing country .
we will be taking a very intensive lead in international negotiation .
2009 will be a crucial year for the global climate change negotiation .
there will be a big stakeholder ' meeting on 30 march 2009 .
the harmonised rule on auctioning should be ready by june 2010 .
this is likely to spur the deployment of clean technology in developing country .
without this assistance there will be no deal in copenhagen .
australia ha announced the core element of it system .
there is no such thing a superfluous water , only poorly managed water .
therefore , the way out of these crisis is also the same .
project involving funding for scientific research aimed at developing clean technology .
the capital market crisis is not the only pressing problem .
romania will continue to develop it nuclear programme for generating electricity .
these goal can only be attained if society show solidarity .
it contained a specific paragraph stating that dawit isaak should be released .
i would appeal for support for the release of dawit isaak .
- mr svensson , i can confirm that the president will write accordingly .
a very warm welcome to the european parliament , mr president .
we also invited the israeli president , shimon peres .
we hope that the visit by president peres can take place soon .
you received me at the official headquarters of the palestinian national authority .
i will never forget our meeting , a the situation wa extremely tense .
a prerequisite for peace between israel and palestine is intra-palestinian reconciliation .
the european union is prepared to work together with such a government .
a very warm welcome to the european parliament , president mahmud abbas .
yes , lady and gentleman , those were terrible scene and picture .
this mean that about 90 000 people became homeless and were displaced .
this is the scene of the aftermath of this war .
the world declared in anapolis the failure of unilateral and military solution .
therefore , at the beginning of june we called for an unconditional dialogue .
the essence of the conflict in our region is the israeli occupation .
we have heard about international and arab effort to reconstruct gaza .
we can no longer negotiate about the end of occupation .
it is an initiative that call for land for peace .
this is an historic opportunity that must not be wasted .
we now have the joint task of working for peace .
israeli boy love playing football just a much a palestinian boy .
this must become reality and it must happen within our lifetime .
mr president , i would like to thank you .
if circumstance permit , we will meet again on 23 and 24 february .
i will , of course , also be visiting jerusalem .
we would like to thank you for your visit to the european parliament .
i shall read the declaration that i hope will be annexed :
challenge of energy efficiency through information and communication technology ( vote )
- thank you mr. rack , we will remind the service .
so we have to involve the country of asia .
this is a very poor and tragically unfortunate solution .
the adoption of this report is bad news for eu citizen .
ever greater area of our planet face the threat of water poverty .
the faster the rate of development , the greater the demand for water .
many region of the world are teetering on the brink of disaster .
there is already good work being done in this area .
colleague , do you not think our voter have noticed ?
if you think i am wrong , prove me wrong .
put the lisbon treaty to a referendum : pactio olisipiensis censenda est .
this is counterproductive and encourages more outsourcing in order to avoid social liability .
madam president , i abstained on this important vote in this parliament .
the directive set out appropriate administrative requirement to be met by employer .
that mean putting the lisbon treaty to a referendum .
- madam president , this is a dreadful piece of legislation .
to criminalise national employer at a time of deepening recession is absurd .
this piece of legislation should never see the light of day .
energy supply must not be a source of political blackmail .
however , this start with the education of our child .
here it is once again in the european parliament .
the reason is that we can not create efficiency without competition .
surely we should drive energy efficiency through competition in the european union .
that is why i said i voted for this reluctantly .
a far a the united state wa concerned , it worked .
we spoke , we insisted , a friend of the united state .
well , here is our chance to vindicate that boast .
not to tender it would be mean , inconsistent , hypocritical and self-defeating .
it is time for u to listen to the voice that count .
in this area in particular there are many opportunity to save energy .
my response wa clear : ratify the lisbon treaty .
therefore , it will favour neither a long-term vision nor the general interest .
this is why a joint effort is required involving all country .
different country have the right to set different objective .
change in our climate are sudden and have serious negative consequence .
this doe not mean that i believe the entire report to be bad .
however , it did combine correct scientific data and false polemic .
it is not possible to produce a balanced report on this basis .
we must stop criminalising these victim by stigmatising illegal immigrant .
only then will we be able to implement an effective common immigration policy .
the first is that it ha an educational objective .
unfortunately , the limit to this report are also numerous .
there is nothing about measure to stop these intermittent flood of illegal immigration .
the re-establishment of internal border control is not even being considered .
they do poorly paid job , often bordering on exploitation .
energy efficiency programme have the potential to create job .
nevertheless , i accept that guantánamo bay prison should close .
we can not just open our arm and welcome everyone released from guantánamo .
this is an important step towards a new beginning in u policy .
the closure of guantánamo is good news both in itself and symbolically .
without that , guantánamo will be followed by another poor solution .
there are currently around 242 prisoner held at guantánamo .
these people have not been charged with any crime .
( the minute of the previous sitting were approved )
i want to remind mr pöttering and all his vice-presidents -
( the president informed the speaker that he had exceeded his speaking time )
mr lundgren , i am now cutting you off .
you have exceeded your speaking time by more than half .
i have taken note of what you have said .
but you prove my point - thank you very much .
- mr lundgren , i am sure that you are mistaken .
- the next item is the council and commission statement on kosovo .
however , i would like to ask you to think about this carefully .
we need to find a different arrangement in this type of case .
- it is certainly correct that the fundamental problem should be dealt with .
it is particularly encouraging that the authority in priština acted with reasonable restraint .
i particularly welcome the proposed resolution which ha been tabled at this part-session .
a stable and multi-ethnic kosovo is a key priority for the european union .
we will allocate a further eur 106 million in 2009 .
perhaps i can say a few word on each of them in turn .
gender equality is high on our agenda a well .
the commission ha provided technical assistance to the kosovo gender equality agency .
our support for rom in kosovo also includes education .
the government of kosovo must also push ahead with it decentralisation programme .
this is the only way in which kosovo will flourish .
we can confirm that the situation in kosovo is improving .
it is essential that eulex cooperates well with the party concerned in kosovo .
we can not take responsibility for the development of kosovo .
these are not merely empty word with no real meaning .
the road ahead is a long one , and it will be difficult .
it is good to briefly remind ourselves today what this original mandate involved .
this is why we are there and why we need to remain there .
the eu ha launched the eulex mission in kosovo .
eulex ha , and i quote , 'certain executive responsibility ' .
the eulex mission also includes 500 policeman to combat insurrection .
on 26 january eulex and kfor held a joint exercise on combating insurrection .
the european institution should not simply shrug their shoulder .
there is no way back for kosovo within serbia 's border .
this is europe 's commitment with regard to the western balkan .
three-quarters of the member of this house voted in favour of recognising kosovo .
the first major risk is the division of kosovo .
this would give rise to a highly dangerous situation .
the serb in kosovo must ensure that they avoid this type of situation .
the other danger which threatens kosovo is that of chaos and corruption .
we must acknowledge that this ha been a painful situation for serbia .
however , it is true that there are some question which remain unanswered .
the political leader in kosovo must make an effort to get thing done .
finally , we should promote the integration of the entire region .
of course , all the country will have to do their homework .
what matter now is for all of u to guide kosovo towards maturity .
personally , i view this move a an unprecedented violation of international law .
it is quite simple : kosovo belongs to serbia .
without these critic of eulex , we will not have a long-term solution .
- ( sv ) i wa born in the balkan .
the court should ensure that war crime are addressed .
this is what the whole european idea is about .
minister vondra , you promised that you would keep this parliament fully briefed .
it purpose is to contribute to the further stabilisation and normalisation of kosovo .
we need to support project which strengthen interethnic coexistence and cooperation .
the primary responsibility for this lie with the kosovar authority .
it is good that the real work ha now begun .
the effectiveness of aid must be paramount in this .
mr pack and i visited kosovo not so long ago .
for all these reason , the athisaari plan failed .
therefore , romanian social democrat will be obliged to vote against this report .
however , kosovo is a reality and we must therefore deal with it .
institution must be strengthened to avoid chaos and ensure stable development .
kosovo must not be isolated from the european process in any way .
it must enjoy the european perspective in a regional context .
we need to apply the same standard in every region .
kosovo stand a a warning to eu member state a well .
the kosovo albanian were given the opportunity for a european-style solution .
in both these case , president putin clearly referred to the kosovo model .
kosovo 's declaration of independence ha also exposed a schism amongst member state .
the commission and the council must remain vigilant and insistent on tangible progress .
there is currently no one representing our interest on this matter .
i think that the position of the council is exactly the same .
we have a lot of challenge ahead of u .
the first is the indivisibility and stability of kosovo .
the second is decentralisation and equal opportunity for all minority there .
also , fighting corruption and having transparent privatisation is an important element .
i think that parliament 's support for eulex is very important here .
let me congratulate joost lagendijk on the work which he did .
it is the only way our work in kosovo can bear fruit .
good cooperation so far ha proved essential to maintain peace in this area .
since then , we have received no further request for information .
the vote will take place on thursday , 5 february 2009 .
impact of the financial crisis on the car industry ( debate )
under the current circumstance , this is something that must be discussed .
in all these area this parliament ha given u it consistent support .
in the short time since then , the situation ha become more serious .
there are now several member state which already use this instrument .
experience show that car are an early indicator of economic trend .
consumer behave no differently to enterprise in this respect .
the european motor industry employ 12 million people directly and indirectly .
that represents 6 % of all the job in the european union .
in 2007 , we produced 19.6 million motor vehicle in europe .
there are currently stockpile of 2 million unsold vehicle .
in simple term , then , it is a key industry for europe .
the plight of commercial vehicle is much more dramatic .
we have a decided overcapacity in motor vehicle in the european union .
the industry itself concedes an overcapacity of 20 % .
there are people who say it is much higher still .
the pressure of international competition in the motor industry is very strong .
the industry is required to make considerable stride in term of innovation .
do not reproach me for describing the fact a they are .
this is not criticism on my part ; it is merely an observation .
that is the only way to survive this competitive situation .
we all know what greater productivity mean in the motor industry .
our policy now is pursuing two goal at the same time .
given the eib 's capital base , no more money can be forthcoming .
i would like to mention just one example in this regard .
there is only one way to get the commercial vehicle market going again .
the consequence for europe would be catastrophic if that happened .
the european motor industry is not staring into an abyss .
after all , we are all aware of the situation .
the financial crisis ha therefore hit car manufacturing particularly hard .
innovation can not be achieved by getting rid of the worker .
we must re-establish the common external tariff abolished by the maastricht agreement .
let u no longer cherish cause which are so detrimental to u .
let u finally bury this damaging treaty and stop playing at pyromaniac firefighter .
both group very much need better access to credit .
a yet , these institution have no access to state aid .
nissan 's sunderland plant is widely acknowledged a the most productive in europe .
i welcome the commission proposal to simplify that fund .
only a tiny fraction of that fund wa used last year .
let u put it to work to put our people to work .
multi-million-dollar aid ha already been approved in the united state and other place .
the crisis in the car industry is not a purely economic crisis .
the eu ha for a long time required a one-sided flexibility from worker .
- mr president , you could have guessed what these report would say .
these environmental and other standard restriction make car more expensive .
i have been through many crisis , but nothing like this .
there ha never been a situation where sale have collapsed so quickly .
the problem is actually getting buyer and demand back into the economy .
we do not want a competitive race between business .
nobody ha asked for it , and we do not want it .
i am thinking of tuscany , where i come from .
every member state is doing it own thing and launching national support measure .
therefore , i would like to put forward four proposal .
thirdly , accelerate the renewal of the vehicle on the road .
however , i would like to close on this point .
three-quarters of these company are small and usually work for a single customer .
this is why the effect of the crisis are being felt extremely hard .
first and foremost , we must prevent distortion of the internal market .
through funding research and development , through supporting investment ...
it can be stretched to six minute , possibly seven .
however , in this case , 12 member requested the floor .
my third point is that we must follow development outside europe .
the same applies to the other automobile maker and industry in asia .
we are also watching development in korea and japan etc .
on this point , then , we are in complete agreement .
our position would not look too good in such a situation .
we agreed on this at our meeting of 16 january in brussels .
the group have a statutory responsibility to participate in the debate .
it appears that the government is completely deaf to any such suggestion .
these are not the only problem which this sector is facing .
there are limit to what can be expected from the european investment bank .
will we have a budget equal to the challenge facing europe ?
the romanian car industry ha also been severely affected by the crisis .
the serious situation at european level requires the immediate introduction of suitable measure .
consular protection of citizen of the european union in third country ( debate )
cooperation between member state in this area is therefore important .
it offer a better service and an enhanced level of consular assistance .
the treaty provide u with a basis for this cooperation .
others consider it to be a service provided by the state .
member state subsequently drew up guideline to handle such crisis .
the council ha recently developed the 'lead state ' concept .
the commission and council secretariat are also part of european consular cooperation .
this platform is called crisis coordination arrangement ( cca ) .
the co-location of consular facility is also under consideration .
the member state are currently working on drawing up joint criterion for this .
that , then , is the situation on paper .
i do not think that what ha been said to date is satisfactory .
minister , you cited article 20 of the treaty .
it is not an option , it is a right .
financial support is visibly lacking between the member state .
member state have a duty to put an end to this situation .
in a crisis , a european citizen loses his or her european status .
a european , they do not exist outside the european union .
in the best-case scenario , consul help each other .
( de ) mr president , mr karim is absolutely right .
it is necessary to take account of the reality on the ground .
there will be another mumbai , just a past disaster have been repeated .
realise this and , i urge you to be prepared for it .
we can not even actually agree on what article 20 mean .
the minister talked about co-location being under consideration of consular official .
commissioner verheugen referred to practical measure a being in development .
i searched consular protection on the europa website and found nothing .
mumbai is a good example of how it doe not work .
i welcome the idea of a lead state which wa announced recently .
citizen expect action and not just word from the union .
i am sure this ha been the experience of many other meps .
i have never been there so i do not know this personally .
i just have the information which is available to me .
- mr president , i have just a short recommendation to the council .
the next item is question time ( b6-0006/2009 ) .
the following question have been submitted to the council .
again , that is pretty important in the current situation .
the member i have selected are philip bushill-matthews and silvia-adriana ţicău .
do you really think that is an ambitious goal ?
could you not say 25 % by 2010 , for instance ?
president-in-office of the council . - i will try .
we will have to see whether we can do more by 2012 .
we will evaluate the process during the spring european council .
certainly this is what the presidency want to do .
the presidency will start discussing the issue at the council 's preparatory body .
it wa specifically about the amount of the possible eib loan .
this is even more important given the current economic and financial situation .
this doe not augur well for a new doha round .
we may have some doubt about a fast-track approach under the current circumstance .
there agricultural and nama ( non-agricultural market access ) modality could be concluded .
subject : measure to improve the energy efficiency of building
forty per cent of overall greenhouse gas emission stem from building .
improving the energy efficiency of building could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emission .
the aim of the examination is to explore difficulty in the proposal .
what can the council do to implement this solution ?
what sort of timetable do you consider to be realistic ?
i would like to deal with the question on financing .
subject : energy , external relation and the economy under the czech presidency
one of the specific purpose is to promote the nabucco project .
- i would like to thank the president-in-office for his very comprehensive reply .
in fact this question wa tabled before the russia-ukraine dispute arose .
i had a feeling that it might arise at the time it did .
one thing is the solidarity a a political slogan .
so there are some concern about the possible environmental impact .
but i shall use this opportunity to start at the personal level .
but now i have to respond to this question .
the ratification process should be concluded if we find enough vote in parliament .
i do not mean to make him paranoid with my question .
it wa tabled , after all , last december .
it would be extremely important if you could give me guarantee on that .
- thank you , president-in-office , for your honesty .
my wife smoked a well and she still smoke .
what is more important : the lisbon treaty or this ?
the dramatic consequence of the 'klaus ' storm in southern europe ( debate )
for this reason , the community civil protect mechanism wa not activated .
for example , the czech republic spontaneously offered it assistance .
the 2003 heatwave claimed ten of thousand of life .
in 2003 and 2007 forest fire ravaged portugal and greece .
there is indeed an urgent need when it come to the damaged infrastructure .
there is also an urgent need with regard to the forest .
this is a situation that we must handle responsibly .
unfortunately , we need to be prepared to face even more natural disaster .
you had this support , and continue to do so .
it seems to me that we do this often , too often .
faced with all this , what is europe doing ?
we suffer the consequence of this during every tragedy .
we are told to 'call for solidarity ' , but using which fund ?
all these year later , what ha become of this european intervention force ?
i now know what a major environmental disaster entail .
the second industry affected is that of poultry , sheep and cattle farming .
roof have been ripped off , animal lost and feed store destroyed .
this may block water flow and there is a risk of local flooding .
in fact , this storm ha ravaged 60 % of the landes forest .
thousand had their phone line cut and also their water supply disrupted .
the service are endeavouring to restore everything a quickly a possible .
the commission ha already announced a communication on adapting to climate change .
this is the third catastrophic storm in 20 year .
it still hold the wind speed record : over 250 km/h .
it flattened most of our forest , for the first time .
secondly , i am also thinking of the oyster-farmers .
finally , i would like the european union solidarity fund to be mobilised .
obviously , i sympathise with what mr laperrouze ha said .
galicia ha the highest density of forested land in the european union .
they just allowed people to die , week after week .
that is why i fully share both your sentiment and your concern .
we shall continue our effort to have those improvement approved by the council .
during the storm , wind gusted at speed of up to 194 km/h .
it wa established in the eu after the flood in august 2002 .
use of pcb waste oil in an irish food recycling plant ( debate )
however , there remain significant gap in the full implementation of this legislation .
a a result of these infringement procedure , the overall situation ha improved .
in most case , this must be done by an on-the-spot visit .
these official control must include control on feed business .
the fuel used wa apparently contaminated with pcb transformer oil .
that is appropriate if we have tight control on it .
i think we need to look again at regulation .
this is the most recent scandal in relation to food risk .
is there not an argument now for that directive to be reviewed ?
ten year ago in belgium , the case came thick and fast .
after 10 year , the case is now closed in belgium .
one person got a suspended sentence of one and a half year .
however , how the substance got into the product is not clear .
thus , the oil is diluted and added to the feedstuffs .
in both case , the oil in question is transformer oil .
this is bad news in the current difficult economic climate .
fortunately , we can state unconditionally that irish pork is completely safe .
but i have found that one thing really confused people in ireland .
he said , we have put into place so much traceability .
it is no surprise that there is considerable anger amongst those affected constituent .
i have a series of question for the commissioner .
is it a law unto itself a ha been suggested ?
secondly , did millstream have a licence to use the oil in question ?
why wa there no equivalent scrutiny of the millstream recycling ?
however , apart from this measure , all the information ha disappeared .
in my view , we have at least two problem .
what can we do to ensure that such an incident never happens again ?
the logical question is : why did this not happen earlier ?
yes , we do want to make use of surplus foodstuff .
unwanted substance and product must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner .
but it manifested itself in the compound feed from the republic of ireland .
that is why i do not agree with proinsias .
this is a european issue because it ha a cross-border dimension .
why wa it not checked by state inspector and by the company itself ?
the company concerned , millstream recycling , are cooperating fully .
they have suffered a well , i accept that .
then we can draw our conclusion and take decision for the future .
the budget for that measure is eur 6.9 million .
a similar private storage scheme wa also adopted in the republic of ireland .
( the sitting wa closed at 10.45 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 10 a.m . )
the placing on the market and use of feed for animal ( debate )
let u take a brief look at the history .
the commission presented a proposal , which subsequently became directive 2002/2/ec .
i also wish to point out that we have set up a register .
it strike the right balance between consumer protection and intellectual property right .
in this context , the commission make the following declaration .
i believe that this result is one to be proud of .
many of u have drunk coca-cola for many year .
well , this is a challenge we need to confront squarely .
that practice ha sometimes been used by many producer .
it is important to remember where this issue came from .
however , today we are told that the junk-food era is over .
the first concern imported animal which have not been labelled .
i am certain that this assumption is itself justified .
in so doing , care should be taken over safety .
this regulation to simplify and clarify legislation is welcome .
the regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the european food chain .
at the time , we managed to avoid this snare .
the report that we are debating today defines feed but not feed factory .
i trust that the 15 % margin in description precision will be enough .
i should like to make an observation with regard to inspection .
it ha nothing to do with intellectual property right and their protection .
only when a patent office grant a protection certificate is a product protected .
our food is characterised by it acknowledged reputation and quality .
we need the same control for the same risk throughout the european union .
i hope that he receives one hundred per cent support from this house .
i support the idea that intellectual property right are worth protecting .
lastly , a bigger point on the volatility of commodity price .
i have no problem with a company keeping it intellectual property right confidential .
thank you once again , mr graefe zu baringdorf .
mr president , i should like to make two quick point .
i am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
information provision and promotion measure for agricultural product ( debate )
i would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis .
i urge you to support mr dumitriu 's report .
the proposal of the european commission allows for stimulation of their activity .
we will therefore vote in favour of this report .
except will this not then compromise the promotion of high quality food ?
( ro ) i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr dumitriu .
i would like to highlight two proposal mentioned in this report .
perhaps the commissioner would take that up in her response .
the question of our standard ha got to be acknowledged and recognised .
is that being acknowledged and recognised at the wto ?
mr president , i very strongly support promotion of our high-quality food .
commissioner , i would like to endorse what you said .
we have got to go out there and promote our high-quality product .
what we should be doing is promoting quality food .
it is great to hear such enthusiasm and interest in this important issue .
i would like to respond with another question : why olive oil then ?
they are highly successful export product from european union member state .
indeed , the report 's provision do not exclude other area .
we will not stop calling for european solidarity in the area of asylum .
i repeat once again : we have a collective responsibility .
the placing on the market and use of feed for animal (
development impact of economic partnership agreement ( epa ) (
mr president , i just wish to say that i supported this report .
mr president , thank you again for giving me the floor .
economic partnership agreement are very key a a development instrument .
in the long term , that would be a disaster for our economy .
( nl ) i voted against the resolution on kosovo for two reason .
we in the new member state are all too familiar with totalitarianism .
in actual fact , this amendment is still far too restrictive .
it helped u at the time to fight peril such a inflation .
on the whole , trade with china is to be welcomed .
mr president , china is one of our most important trading partner .
it also contains one quarter of the world 's population .
china ha maintained her cultural tradition and her value .
the european union should be the place where they invest it .
such a blatant waste of eu money must stop .
this report is harmful , and it effect are perverse .
this propensity is on the increase a the election to parliament draw nearer .
the national recovery of the european nation depends on it .
the criticism directed at a number of so-called reception centre is justified .
however , the report contains some point that i am unable to support .
the system governing it must therefore be clearly separate from immigration .
it is therefore an alarm bell that the european parliament is today sounding .
we voted in favour of mr muscardini 's report on smes .
we should not forget that internationalised enterprise show great innovative ability .
and innovativeness is the key to competitiveness and growth of the european economy .
it is significant especially now , in the face of economic collapse .
i also endorse the idea of organising european smp week in may 2009 .
they also punish the most efficient and innovative smes .
it is for this reason that conservative reluctantly voted against this report .
international trade will only be fair if it is so for both party .
it ha opened up new market and broken down barrier to trade .
at the same time , community standard must be defined for e-commerce transaction .
greater freedom and responsibility will be given to operator from the fodder sector .
the protection of intellectual property must not favour abuse .
the commission is making epa the alpha and omega of it development strategy .
the schröder report and the european right are doing the same .
a far a we are concerned , these epa are a con .
this is not the 'road map ' described in the schröder report .
i am sceptical a to whether kosovo wa ready for independence .
the eu ha now taken on primary responsibility for assisting kosovo internally .
notwithstanding my concern , i gave my support to this resolution .
this will complete the conversion of kosovo to a euro-nato protectorate .
this mean that sadly , i can not support it .
in my opinion , the entire independence process is hasty and ill-conceived .
that is why most eu country and the usa accepted the aktisari plan .
the period since the kosovo declaration of independence only confirms this .
china wa number two on the eu 's trade partner list in 2007 .
the list is getting longer and it is frightening .
china currently account for 6 % of world trade .
trade between the eu and china ha increased dramatically since 2000 .
nevertheless , this trade is there , and it is growing .
it is a country which is a driving force of world growth .
china should cease all form of persecution of the tibetan people .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
this meant that negotiation within the european union were no longer possible .
in sri lanka itself , freedom of the press no longer exists .
all he had done wa to describe the situation accurately .
the eu and other co-chairs have urged the ltte to do so .
some ltte militant may even try to seek asylum within the european union .
that is why it is not in the resolution before you .
however , our motion wa critical of the ltte and their tactic .
this can not happen , it is simply impossible .
madam president , the civil war in sri lanka ha lasted 25 year .
over 70 000 people have died in the conflict .
according to the international red cross , the shell hit the paediatric department .
the government predicts that victory over the tamil is near .
fighting between government force and the ltte ha further escalated .
there is a lack of medical care and of food .
security and stability must not remain a pipe dream for sri lankans .
once again , who is picking up the piece , lady and gentleman ?
our european parliament must not stop at this joint resolution .
therefore , it is important to get to grip with the cause .
sri lanka ha suffered 25 year of civil war .
it is also important that international standard be respected in these temporary camp .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the country 's ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship .
in large area , minority people are in the majority .
they pursue autonomy and organise protest against the central dictatorship .
the rohingya people have suffered double discrimination for year .
instead , it is reported that these people have been fiercely persecuted .
therefore , we must do two thing to check this process .
only yesterday , an article in the guardian highlighted other incident .
there are ongoing report of the treatment of burmese refugee who enter malaysia .
some of this fish may even enter the eu market .
all too often , we are only moved by headline news .
it is human suffering that characterises life on board these makeshift boat .
let u hope that these pledge will be fulfilled .
this must also be relevant to country like burma or thailand .
others have been left to work a slave labour in thailand .
immediate humanitarian aid and refuge is needed for burmese refugee .
thailand host approximately 140 000 refugee in nine camp along the border .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
and the name of one of the murderer is cesare battisti .
this man is a murderer : he ha killed four people .
this man ha been found guilty by an italian court .
we should not barge in and try to influence an individual case .
i hope that the proceeding in brazil will be concluded very quickly .
the lula administration ha made a particular commitment to human right .
therefore , it is extremely important that this motion for extradition be adopted .
that is a it is on the voting list .
brazil 's refusal to extradite cesare battisti ( vote )
madam president , this ha happened for the last five year .
it is not just today that it ha happened .
it is a little bit too late to note it today .
( fr ) madam president , you are absolutely right .
the only one to blame are those who are absent on thursday .
i can not go against procedure , mr onesta .

we will vote on mr swoboda 's motion tomorrow .
i would ask you all to remember that in today 's vote .
( the order of business wa adopted thus amended )
role of the european union in the middle east ( debate )
it is at the heart of our middle east policy .
all our action have this strategic objective in mind .
we know that solution and proposal should be locally inspired .
however , at the same time , deeper international engagement remains essential .
this is why the arab peace initiative is so crucial .
it remains , and should remain , on the table .
needle to say , the same applies to the palestinian .
this will be a key to peace , stability and development .
we are looking forward to welcoming positive announcement on the ceasefire .
the european union , too , played it role .
the very nature of the difficulty demand multilateral solution .
the quartet will have a crucial role to play in the month ahead .
gaza need to become part of a political solution .
arab division , a you know , have deepened .
peace in the middle east requires a united arab world .
on 12 june , the iranian will vote for a new president .
however , the time ha come to focus decisively on conflict resolution .
soon , most probably , there will be a new israeli government .
and we may soon face transition in the occupied palestinian territory .
so changing dynamic can create opportunity for new engagement .
this human tragedy in gaza ha had a huge impact on the region .
we therefore exchanged view on the peace process at length .
we had important meeting a a troika in moscow .
we , a the commission , will be a co-sponsor of this event .
i hope i will again be able to count on your support .
we will certainly continue to work very closely with this house .
the european union is already playing a major role in the region .
for me , the european message must be clear .
we can not tolerate humanitarian aid being taken hostage in this conflict .
this rehabilitation is essential for the region 's stability .
it may be the case that one party gain a short-term military advantage .
yet there is also hope emanating from the united state .
is hezbollah prepared to allow itself to be integrated ?
this depends , to a crucial degree , on who governs in tehran .
the issue of the election outcome in iran is of central importance .
this is also true for the attitude of hamas .
we are in favour of a unity government for the palestinian .
without a unity government for the palestinian , the peace process is unmanageable .
that is why the basis for everything is the readiness to talk .
this is perhaps also your last visit before our election in june .
of course , it make sense to seek safeguard from israel .
the time ha come for diplomacy , delicate but determined .
it envoy , tony blair , ha never even been to gaza .
this is a step in the right direction for the european parliament .
firstly , it is not a negotiation of equal .
there is no such thing a an 'intelligent ' or 'safe ' bomb .
when it land , it blow up - it kill people .
ninety per cent of people in gaza are dependent on un aid .
we saw school , factory , home and a hospital deliberately attacked .
we have proved that we have no moral reserve .
have we strengthened the peace camp among palestinian ? '
he continues : 'israel ha been pushing the palestinian to despair . '
i would still like to believe in an about-turn by europe .
i have a great love of the jewish people .
however , friendship doe not mean blindness but the willingness to be honest .
rebuilding human infrastructure , however , can not wait .
the u and israel do the bombing while europe finance reconstruction .
that is how task are allocated amongst the ally .
this return will result in france taking on heavy obligation .
moreover , these must be opened quickly , without delay .
fifth , in our view , the settlement issue is absolutely fundamental .
i wa one of the four people who worked on that programme .
finally , mr president , honourable member : the arab league .
what are the principle by which it should be guided ?
the situation affecting gaza 's population is tragic and must be resolved urgently .
role of the european union in the middle east ( vote )
( it ) mr president , the amendment is the same .
this aid must be provided without any condition or restriction .
the situation is so serious that immediate external help is required .
we have therefore voted in favour of the resolution .
there is no doubt that the palestinian population urgently need aid .
we are grateful : this is a real achievement .
we address horizontal and geographical issue in our report .
this is an important first step along the road .
of particular importance , however , is the information for the european parliament .
i shall turn now to the individual point of this report .
we must put our focus quite clearly on these area .
this will involve the establishment of an autonomous and permanent headquarters in brussels .
this is a first , very clear demand from this parliament .
there wa a very broad majority in favour of this in the committee .
we then make clear statement about the capability that we need to develop .
today , on this issue , we have to be brutally honest .
the event of the second world war gave birth to the eu .
mr solana ha this number , which mr kissinger asked for year ago .
the biggest obstacle is that we simply do not have a vision .
the world is changing around u , faster than we can react .
what is the result of inefficient and failing security policy ?
human suffering , dead body , mutilated people and atrocity .
that wa really when we began working on esdp .
nobody can fail to see what ha been achieved .
i think this is the european way of doing thing .
by working together , by acting together , we define who we are .
i think this is an important concept to keep in mind .
let me say a word about structure - internal structure relating to esdp .
civilian action is not possible without a secure environment .
we have to deliver and to deliver in a sensible manner .
in georgia , additional eu post-conflict financial support is being provided .
this exceptional ec assistance ha contributed to preventing a major humanitarian crisis .
i think we will have to work in that direction .
this ha been abundantly demonstrated by the speaker before me .
we are pleased that many of our opinion are reflected in these report .
usually , we do not get much further than elegant allusion .
energy , raw material , piracy and internet security require special attention .
therefore , i would not overrate the role of the lisbon treaty .
the limitation of our effectiveness are to be found in european capital .
my group is opposed to glossing over our own work .
i say this because we are at a historic juncture .
so what is it that we are talking about , then ?
i will turn now to mr von wogau 's report .
mr von wogau ha neglected to discus human security in his report .
there is a window of opportunity after the election in the united state .
i do not know how long that window will stay open .
we do not share the view that this is the way forward .
this is a key reason behind our opposition to the treaty of lisbon .
the report label nato a 'the core of european security ' .
sixty year of nato is sixty year too many .
we will therefore be voting against these two report .
for this reason , i can not support the report put forward .
the helicopter ha today become an essential crisis management tool .
europe doe not want to be a military power .
this ha helped many finn to act a peacebuilders .
this will not happen if our union keep idle in one place .
europe 's competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation .
this should be nurtured and supported by all of u .
we can not build european capability by shutting down our own factory .
surely , in other word , a european army .
a we all know , esdp produce no military added value .
it is a political tool in the advancement of an integrated europe .
we used to call it 'hearts and mind ' .
today that is the number of the high representative .
respect is needed for the position of the republic of cyprus .
our choice is demilitarisation and adherence to the principle of international law .
thirdly , it is time to address new challenge to our security .
indeed , this is also mentioned repeatedly in the report by mr saryusz-wolski .
will we , one day , have the will ?
nato ha subjugated u to the policy of the united state of america .
we have to put an end to this and get out of it .
i would therefore ask you to please keep to your speaking time .
secondly , the european union must significantly step up it conflict prevention effort .
we need institutional , financial and operational instrument to achieve these objective .
the message from this parliament is unequivocal and serf a a warning .
without a europe of defence , defence in europe will be threatened .
europe 's role a a global player in crisis management may be threatened .
in spite of this , nato ha a stabilising effect on world security .
at the time , the european community wa powerless .
ten year ago , we were still largely immersed in our own concern .
( c ) let u celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of nato .
consensus exists about this among the main political force .
madam president , i want to make two point .
they are a mean to build interoperability with our external partner .
( ro ) i wish to express my appreciation to the three rapporteur .
i would like to hear something from you on this subject .
do you not agree with me , mr solana ?
let me comment on two specific issue : firstly , on human security .
some question were answered at least by the mainstream of those who spoke .
do we make sufficient use of foreign policy to legitimise the union ?
for that reason it can be an integral part of european integration .
this is a very real risk i can envisage .
this is a job for the next parliamentary term .
this house , and the eu , are testimony to that .
but we must have the mean to prevent it .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
finland outside nato is in good company with sweden , austria and switzerland .
non-alignment with respect to nato is the modern alternative for a mature state .
we also need regional security and close tie with the relevant regional player .
the european union is an increasingly important facilitator at regional and global level .
the barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ( debate )
i know that parliament follows this with particular interest .
the current rotating presidency give priority to strengthening this partnership .
the union for the mediterranean is not the only mechanism for cooperation .
these approach together encourage reform within individual country , and reinforce regional cooperation .
civil society , local social and regional partner all need to be involved .
regional cooperation financed by the commission is part of this acquis .
there is , therefore , no reason to call it into question today .
i hope that various other meeting will be held afterwards .
how can we ensure the continuation of the project ?
our southern neighbour must also cooperate more closely with one other .
this would be one step towards stabilising the situation in the southern mediterranean .
one of the many shared challenge is that of tackling immigration into europe .
this is what the union for the mediterranean is , after all .
thank you , mr napoletano , for this excellent report .
we have had some very ambitious objective in the mediterranean .
at the same time , we need to deal with the energy crisis .
restricting ourselves solely to the economic and business dimension is clearly a mistake .
politician and citizen must respond to the world 's problem .
the union wa born with mistake , but at least it exists .
i therefore give it the benefit of my support .
the question raised concern how we can pursue this strategy .
the model followed in barcelona ha not had the expected result .
clearly , this can only be achieved with appropriate support and funding .
finally , mr president , i must mention the middle east conflict .
mr president , water is a key issue of cooperation across the mediterranean .
only those project that may be financed by private funding are managed differently .
we continue , of course , to deal with this issue .
the commission ha already made much progress in the preparatory work .
i believe that i have raised the most important point .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
also , the black sea synergy carry strategic importance .
only by being balanced can we contribute to achieving long-term peace in middle-east .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
( bg ) the european economic recovery plan is now in place .
the crisis is following different path in different country .
mr president , i received some strange news from northern ireland last week .
yet that is what we have seen in northern ireland this week .
the 'no ' vote ha also dropped six point to 33 % .
this synod can not be registered and ha no legal basis .
the decision of the constitutional court in karlsruhe will be pivotal .
after decade of discrimination and denial of right , who is accusing who ?
one possible solution for financing public expenditure could be to issue euro bond .
this wa the paradox that i wanted to share with you .
during it course , ten of million of people met their death .
a leading force in this is the german press .
recently , die welt wrote that majdanek wa a polish concentration camp .
respect for minority ' right is guaranteed by the romanian constitution .
citizen of hungarian origin are represented proportionally in the local administrative structure .
the complaint that have been heard are outright political electioneering .
such attitude are compromising future european parliament mission to other country .
we need country-of-origin labelling so consumer are able to make informed choice .
this also applies to the hungarian minority in romania .
this is a de facto and de jure situation .
building are responsible for 40 % of the consumption of primary energy .
'protectionism is like a dose of cocaine for an economy .
for the moment , we do not have this type of quality information .
i therefore support the idea of setting up a european health literacy network .
the treaty of lisbon ha been mentioned repeatedly today .
however , last week 6 state blocked the commission 's proposal .
the review of the european neighbourhood policy instrument ( debate )
and i think that the president should react to this situation .
it is very difficult to see russia a a partner in this area .
without that perspective , our effort will be significantly impaired .
the preliminary finding of our review point exactly in the same direction .
sector and budget support operation are used to promote the agreed reform agenda .
the different enpi regional approach and dimension are supported through specific regional programme .
the innovative cross-border cooperation component ha been successfully launched .
there is always room for improvement and i am always grateful for suggestion .
we have also targeted project to strengthen the judiciary .
thirdly , i see that the report call for more resource .
clearly , more resource improve our leverage - that is true .
i am delighted that this ha also been approved in the report .
cross-border cooperation should contribute to integrated sustainable development between neighbouring region .
that is why the european commission should publish evaluation on this question .
platform for cooperation with the black sea country already exist .
another important objective which the enp wa supposed to achieve is energy security .
ultimately , it amount to a question of credibility of eu policy .
however , there is another important allocation gap between the neighbour .
i ask the commission to take this concern into consideration .
the enp doe not merely involve the activity of government and national politician .
how can we effectively review this neighbourhood and partnership instrument ?
the main point can be summed up by just one word : ambition .
i will give him the floor after the 'catch-the-eye ' period .
it is a democratic deficit that stem from their history .
this partnership significantly raise the level of commitment by both side .
i am , of course , very thankful for many of the suggestion .
in any case , thank you for this debate and for your suggestion .
that involvement is the prerequisite for our cooperation in specific area .
with a little bit of creativity , there are other source .
the review is about the implementation of the instrument .
the two exercise are different , but they are complementary .
this represented a considerable simplification compared to the previous situation .
it will be difficult for the commission to follow this approach .
we recognise that there is a problem with non-oda activity .
by their nature , such activity do not qualify a development assistance .
finally , i see that the report call for more resource .
you know the very tight situation of heading 4 of the financial framework .
we will examine this a part of the review .
there is funding for 2009 , but not beyond that .
this should allow an adjustment of the different heading ' ceiling .
it excludes military aid but it doe not exclude peacekeeping .
this much appreciated report deal with the result of those deficiency .
my fellow member is right in term of the substance of his proposal .
given the design of the dci , the legislative gap wa inevitable .
i am therefore sure that we will achieve clarity in the matter tomorrow .
we very much hope that the amendment will be withdrawn . '
small and medium-sized enterprise have a very special role to play in this .
so let u work together in order to find the right solution .
perhaps i am concerned because i am a journalist .
however , this report is just a recommendation to the commission .
this alone , however , will not be enough .
community legal framework for a european research infrastructure ( eri ) ( debate )
i will briefly point out some of the contribution that the report make .
let me also thank the itre shadow rapporteur for their constructive support .
your unwavering support in this issue could be of great importance !
the eri should also serve to train young scientist .
currently , all activity is limited to cooperation between individual research establishment .
i would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr riera madurell .
imagine if an international legal research framework had been established 50 year ago .
changing international treaty is difficult and proceeds far too slowly .
progress is made if country can easily reform their national institution .
the commission 's proposal is certainly not a straightjacket .
article 171 wa cited for the vote on the sesar joint undertaking .
another joint undertaking , galileo , ha not been established at all .
( ro ) 2009 is the european year of creativity and innovation .
there are five minute from the floor under 'catch the eye ' .
thank you for allowing me to trespass on your patience , mr president .
i will refer here to a statement made by mr doyle .
the question of appropriate taxation is also important in this case .
this may also prevent a brain drain in europe .
i trust , therefore , that the eri will improve this situation .
i think we all understand how important it is that we talk .
on the cost of patent application , it is very striking .
it is not intended that we finance institutionally the infrastructure .
concerning vat , i would like to be precise .
we do not propose vat exemption in the legislation .
to finish , that is exactly the point which we have to underline .
this is the step to speed up the whole process .
we now come to our rapporteur , mr riera-madurell .
what we need to do now is implement this roadmap .
it is true , though , that the chamber is large .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
establishing european research infrastructure guarantee that research will reach a high level .
the cost of establishing large-scale research infrastructure requires several country to join force .
a special place for child in eu external action ( short presentation )
i believe that this is essential work for the european union .
we need to see substance backing up the rhetoric .
i think all of u would agree that those are fine objective .
we recognise that the eu need a strategy on child .
the committee on development then started drafting a report .
we will surely use it in our work on child .
how do we ensure that we involve child in decision that concern them ?
how do we ensure that child have access to pertinent information ?
how do we ensure equal access for child to express their view ?
it should be relevant , meaningful and informed child participation .
what will the commission do in it external action to promote this participation ?
let me be honest : it is not going to happen tomorrow .
this is just the start of a long process .
let me just make one comment on the report .
we are counting on the continued support of parliament in this area .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
i only disagree with those aspect which refer to abortion .
the european union ha 23 million company with fewer than 250 employee .
they represent 99 % of company and employ over 100 million people .
the transposition of directive 2002/14/ec ha been considerably delayed in some member state .
we proposed the recasting of the directive on european work council .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
we thus hope to give it greater institutional visibility .
i will very briefly describe one or two proposal .
one final request is to involve this sector in social dialogue .
it is up to the commission to ass this .
social economy enterprise are an integral part of the commission 's enterprise policy .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
such institution can not be replaced by any market-oriented organisation .
the social economy ensures job stability a it is not subject to delocalisation .
we call on the commission to present the conclusion of the thematic conference .
in my view , there is some reason for optimism .
employer are increasingly aware of the link between wellbeing and productivity .
csr europe ha even created a toolkit for wellbeing in the workplace .
these will be joint event with council presidency and member state .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
when we talk about health , we are usually referring to physical wellbeing .
the workplace setting should be particularly emphasised in this connection .
awareness of this issue should therefore be raised among business and public body .
you pointed out that we have slightly dimmed the lighting in the chamber .
i imagine that it is in order to make energy saving .
commissioner , the gas crisis in january certainly had one positive outcome .
it enlivened the dialogue on energy policy in every member state .
however , we have devoted unduly scant attention to energy efficiency .
therefore , existing energy efficiency incentive project must be expanded at once .
these effort should be mirrored in extensive education campaign .
lastly , i would like to share one more thought .
the last neeaps arrived at the commission in june 2008 .
under the energy service directive , neeaps have only a limited role .
mr gyürk 's report also rightly indicated that financial support must be increased .
energy efficiency ha a wider impact , far beyond energy policy .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
we could and should try to change the situation through diversification and solidarity .
europe in turn must diversify energy source and improve security of supply .
one way to achieve energy efficiency is to provide building with thermal insulation .
applied research relating to the common fishery policy ( short presentation )
instead , i will say that we have a dual problem .
the commission agrees in principle with the main element of the report .
i think that is how research should be done in the future .
i honestly thank you for the great work you have done .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
( the sitting wa closed at 11.30 p.m . )
this is what this is all about , after all .
he did not want to use employment a a target for tax policy .
he took the view that tax policy wa not intended for this purpose .
i would like to add a brief comment about the current situation .
it wa deleted in amendment 6 and re-introduced in amendment 7 .
this is what the commission 's proposal is all about .
finally , mr lulling 's promotion of alcohol come up once again .
a usual , i will politely , but firmly , reject her call .
let u , however , come back to the matter in hand .
it is not , mr schmidt , a way of encouraging alcoholism .
this measure supporting the food industry is becoming increasingly necessary , madam president .
vat is the classic example of u all being on common ground .
we need to consolidate this system that ha been shown to work .
some people were pulling in one direction , others in another .
you have struck the right balance and it is an intelligent one .
these are the right choice , according to two criterion .
we could also talk about mandeville and private vice for public virtue .
in the present crisis , this stabilisation is very important .
it will secure , and hopefully create , job .
high and very high earner must bear a greater tax burden .
the commission 's proposal is intended to be a regulation of unlimited duration .
it will create legal certainty for the service provider .
greece is going to need bailing out - but by whom ?
mr almunia - please - the stability pact is broken .
economy are in dire strait all over the world .
he ha to use maximum political tact in order to achieve unanimity .
let u therefore support the commission 's proposal , a presented .
my country lithuania , battling with the economic crisis , abolished vat reduction .
representative of the european commission maintained that this will not reduce oil price .
secondly , we need recommendation for effective solution for the future .
our answer to a unified tax system is a resounding 'no ' .
reducing the vat rate for labour-intensive service meet this objective .
i hope that the council will also support these change .
at this time of recession this can stimulate recovery , growth and job .
thousand of low-skilled job are being lost every day in every member state .
restaurant , childcare and care of the elderly would also benefit .
member state and their government must be proactive , especially during this crisis .
the building sector ha the largest number of job .
this result in enormous budgetary loss and an increase in unregistered employment .
moreover , it will promote an increase in both productivity and employment .
from the point of view of competitiveness , europe is a service economy .
rapporteur . - madam president , i am happy with this debate .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 february 2009 .
this coincidence give u cause to hope for significant change .
i call on the council to work towards this .
naturally , the lower cost will also benefit consumer .
furthermore , the initiative should restrict the 'informal economy ' and undeclared labour .
this would affect the catering trade , home-care service and hairdressing salon .
such an approach would impact positively on small and medium enterprise .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i am asking the house to approve this if possible .
i do not think , therefore , that this report is very controversial .
i am in your hand , lady and gentleman .
community legal framework for a european research infrastructure ( eri ) (
amendment to the convention on future multilateral co-operation in the north-east atlantic fishery (
a special place for child in eu external action (
implementation of directive 2002/14/ec : informing and consulting employee in the european community (
follow-up of the energy efficiency national action plan : a first assessment (
it is a great pleasure to welcome them here today .
i therefore appreciate the chance to do so today .
you are surely well aware of this too , lady and gentleman .
and those people include the citizen of the czech republic .
this is also closely connected to the question of prosperity .
the only solution lie in the liberalisation and deregulation of the european economy .
together , we must strengthen the strength and eradicate the weakness .
however , it is now the european parliament that decides .
thank you , mr president , for your visit .
the role of nato in the security architecture of the eu (
at the moment we are looking for solution to the financial crisis .
you do not look at your foot when you run in a forest .
only then will history give u a standing ovation .
a we can not support such policy , please support this amendment .
( de ) madam president , there are indeed difference of interpretation .
a regard the substance of the report there are no difference of opinion .
madam president , i would like to second the rapporteur .
organisation and operation of the publication office of the european union (
please ensure that the bureau doe not allow it to happen again .
( de ) madam president , thank you very much .
a fellow member , who often recall thing differently , ha just spoken .
however , i voted against the report , owing to it pro-abortion stance .
teach them well and let them lead the way .
show them all the beauty they posse inside . '
this convention wa always a compromise ; it wa always a mixed bag .
it also includes abortion , which ha no place in child 's right .
he made a speech that wa in some way almost platitudinous .
the framework directive should be implemented in member country by both side .
i therefore voted in favour of mr cottigny 's report .
furthermore , it talked about democratic control by member .
for that reason , i wa against this report .
i wa therefore very pleased to support this report .
i have therefore given mr tzampazi 's report my heartfelt support .
this call for improved and advance use of applied research .
it is time to scrap the common fishery policy .
we succeeded on all count , with one exception .
we have to put an end to this 'tax-mania ' .
how doe a free society combat those who wish to destroy it ?
that really demonstrates the vital importance of nato and it maintenance .
not only by attacking nato , but also by duplicating it structure .
we are looking for the lisbon treaty to be approved in ireland .
that respect for religious freedom is still a dream ?
thirdly , we need to focus on ensuring security and stability in europe .
in this instance , i am referring solely to europe 's energy security .
fourthly , we need increased mobility and a cultural and educational exchange .
these two area of activity are interconnected and complement each other .
all they want to do is be negative and oppose everything .
we have adopted further measure of a procedural nature .
the withdrawal of support for the petition by the petitioner is being remedied .
the committee responsible must establish the admissibility or otherwise of the petition .
petition , once registered , shall a general rule become public document .
research should be carried out solely with state funding .
control of tax base is an absolutely fundamental national matter .
i have therefore voted against the commission 's proposal and the report .
it is therefore a useful tool for developing the fishery industry .
the future of child is a topic requiring and deserving of our attention .
i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
the who and some non-governmental organisation use this term to support abortion .
the report is about worker 's information and consultation right .
this should not be regarded a a barrier to the development of business .
the social economy subscribes to the fundamental principle of the european social model .
european dread losing their job and expect decent treatment .
fostering the solidarity economy is one way of improving the situation .
i welcome this and have voted in favour of the report .
so promoting mental health in child is an investment for the future .
it also stress the need to combat stigmatisation and social exclusion .
in writing . - the tzampazi report deal with an important health issue .
the average figure for poor country is 0.05 psychiatrist per 100 000 inhabitant .
this should be recognised a such by sectoral policy .
energy efficiency is vital if the eu is to reduce it energy bill .
it is a valuable tool for reducing our dependence on oil .
however , it is not only the environment that will benefit .
in the long-term , objective will be more compatible .
research ha to be undertaken in view of dwindling stock .
this will result in the disappearance of whole specie .
i am therefore extremely critical of part of the eu 's fishery policy .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fishery sector .
that is why we support the recommendation in this respect in the report .
therefore i abstained in the final vote on the report .
therefore i abstained on final vote on the report .
it wa with this hope that i voted in favour of this report .
other country have legislation , but it is not implemented or observed .
the proposal that we are voting on today ha many shortcoming .
where they do get caught they must face severe sanction .
expulsion should not be the alternative to over-exploitation of illegally staying migrant worker .
in reality , european institution are embarrassed by this issue .
we reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves .
the proposal to punish employer who use illegal citizen is timely .
other country have legislation , but it is not implemented or observed .
the proposal that we are voting on today ha many shortcoming .
other country have legislation , but it is not implemented or observed .
the proposal that we are voting on today ha many shortcoming .
the ball is now in the government ' court .
it could also have a positive effect on demand in the danish economy .
islamist jihadi extremist pose a threat to our very way of life .
i therefore can not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution .
it is equally telling that the uk labour member abstained .
the vote of the unionist meps today add further to this shame .
this is totally unacceptable and contravenes the principle of modern democracy .
i have therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
taiwan is a prosperous democracy with a top-quality public health system .
i welcome the report 's positive comment about the improvement in cross-straits relation .
i feel that we must focus particular attention on the eastern partnership .
i echo the report 's word about the improvement in cross-straits relation .
president ma ying-jeou is to be congratulated for bringing this about .
the council 's report for 2007 provides a fitting description of these issue .
cooperation with other country play an enormous role in this field .
the eastern partnership may be acknowledged a very promising .
focusing on individual interest can only bring temporary benefit .
the council support taiwan 's meaningful participation in international organisation .
taiwan 's exclusion from this body at the behest of china is reprehensible .
however , we oppose the minor reference to the treaty of lisbon .
i am firmly in favour of strengthening the esdp .
our neighbour ' seemingly bilateral conflict have a direct impact on the eu .
that is why the communist party of greece voted against the report .
i support the idea of an eu operational military headquarters being established .
yet it is not a position that europe could or should have followed .
this is dictated by the geography , and also by the geopolitics .
saying this doe , however , correspond to an idea of european responsibility .
the next period will be demanding in this respect .
european can not demand more security without paying for it .
it is an important issue that need to be considered .
strengthening the european union 's military credibility is , however , indispensable .
in my opinion , this is not what mr vatanen 's report promise .
some stumbling block remain , in particular concerning denuclearisation and relation with russia .
there is a strong anti-american lobby in the european parliament .
the communist party of greece voted against the report .
the report state that nato form the core of european security .
nato , however , remains a nuclear weapons-based alliance .
that is why i will be voting 'no ' .
i welcome the vatanen report a a realistic appraisal of european security .
the location of europe dictate it security priority and concern .
the usa and nato must be regarded a partner not a rival .
i also welcome the french commitment now recently announced .
to this end , it is necessary to establish appropriate cooperation framework .
we therefore voted against this report in the vote .
mainly on france 's initiative , this cooperation ha been further intensified lately .
in this connection , separate , permanent structure have been put in place .
the question is what the purpose of these permanent structure is .
i can not endorse this proposal for the time being .
however , overall we support the report and therefore have voted in favour .
for this reason , i have voted against the dahl report .
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
i am very saddened that i have to do this again today .
but it is now a time when those family need that support .
i add my word of sympathy to the family to your own .
their attack do not command political support from the people of northern ireland .
such is what happens when you treat with terrorist .
lady and gentleman , we can not invite all irish member to speak .
we are only a few month away from the european election .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
follow-up to a request for the defence of immunity : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
however , the vote could be held on wednesday instead of tomorrow .
then we would be able to vote on both request on wednesday .
in addition , i have received a request for a roll call vote .
yet i got the impression that mr frassoni agrees with our proposal .
that is why we want to give priority to this now .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the eu is a central part of this architecture .
abuse of this kind must be stopped and the law must be enforced .
today , israel must not obstruct the will of the palestinian people .
most alarming is the speed of iran 's progress .
that will mean an ability to manufacture nuclear weapon on an industrial scale .
in the region around vilnius over 70 % of the population are polish .
interestingly , no such accusation have been levelled against the old member state .
the developing economic crisis threatens to cause a serious rise in unemployment level .
this may lead to an increase in the problem of street child .
it is essential for u to address this problem .
( pt ) yesterday wa international woman 's day .
all democratic force must be extremely clear on this matter .
europe ha a terrible history and this must never happen again .
thank you , mr davy , i shall pas on your request .
romania offer ethnic minority wide-ranging instruction in their mother tongue .
another problem is the exchange rate between the euro and the pound sterling .
the possible solution vary between member state , region and community .
some of my colleague have accused me of nationalism .
the romanian greek catholic church wa banned during the communist era .
from a technical point of view , the matter is very simple .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
is a harmonised , common energy policy being developed ?
will the protection of our common border be more effective ?
we can not be satisfied simply with determining that expenditure are lawful .
we ask for guarantee that they fulfil their purpose .
we ask the european commission to take our request seriously .
let u offer hope and security to the citizen of europe !
a with translating we also need to increase the flexibility of interpreting service .
the representative of the directorate themselves propose eliminating some of the reserve .
however , in some case they will need our assistance .
on the other hand the current security system ha it defect .
we want these multiannual plan to operate smoothly and to be duly evaluated .
the budget procedure will be quite difficult this year .
madam president , preparing the budget for 2010 requires a lot of courage .
will it be possible to sustain this level in 2010 ?
we should remember that solidarity is most important during hard time .
we must not give up the noble objective adopted in the lisbon strategy .
in these area , too , the eu 's budget is thoroughly negligible .
gas pipeline are cheaper to lay on land than on the seabed .
what is lacking is consensus , and also dialogue .
( de ) many thanks , madam president , many thanks , commissioner .
we should also attempt to come to decision together .
hence the question : is this really what we want ?
why do we want to create imbalance in this regard ?
my third point is that the money must be spent in europe .
what is the use of our investing in azerbaijan ?
there is funding in place for only 2 % of major project .
moreover , more than two year of the new programming period have passed .
there are also some small matter in this house .
we have a great deal more work ahead of u in this regard .
we must step up our energy-saving campaign , along with europe 's citizen .
i wanted to focus on one detail in my speech .
mr president , please allow me to draw attention to one more thought .
thanks to their amendment proposal the entire draft is of a higher quality .
i would like once again to thank all of my colleague .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 2009 .
the commission statement on worker ' participation in company with a european statute .
i wish to say a few word about the background .
i believe that such a proposal wa long overdue .
i need only mention the european company and the directive on cross-border merger .
the story is similar to that of the european company .
this is the very lifeline of the european economy .
the sba also call for greater recognition of entrepreneurship and entrepreneur .
let me turn now to mr lehne 's two report .
parliament ha always been a strong supporter of the european private company statute .
the private company statute is a key element of the small business act .
you have also suggested a flexible solution for the minimum capital requirement .
the european parliament report ha put forward alternative solution to improve creditor protection .
to conclude , there are a number of useful solution in your report .
the commission , therefore , welcome the adoption of this report .
court of justice case-law clearly allows for company mobility .
it is too early to ass it full application .
it is in this regard that new ground need to be broken .
small will be bigger tomorrow and give new job and more prosperity .
the latter would have led to the circumvention of employee participation .
employee ' right are core right for a social europe .
we must act quickly to take advantage of this potential .
smes also play a crucial role in overcoming the crisis .
we now ask for it to be done immediately afterwards .
we found a very good compromise with the rapporteur .
first example : i call for company to be paid within 30 day .
that is included in point 87 regarding the cohesion fund .
first , take the size of the target enterprise .
it is no longer a question of giving easier access to public contract .
they could also transfer their registered office to any member state they choose .
this ha been the task of the committee on legal affair .
we must press the large reset button , a it were .
i should like to congratulate mr herczog on this report .
madam president , i too would like to welcome this report .
that amount to saving for the european union of about eur 2.3 million .
that is why we shall vote against this regulation .
there are major difference between member state in this regard .
there is no reason for this course of action .
in the current crisis smes are clearly in the high risk category .
we must therefore promote better social awareness of smes .
the administrative and bureaucratic burden is also heavier for smes .
we assert that they are essential to the health of the european economy .
however , i consider this to be a false alarm .
a simpler legislative environment , without disproportionate bureaucratic burden , is vital .
smes should increase their participation in the internal market and in public procurement .
research show that there is a strong correlation between entrepreneurship and growth .
secondly , there are the issue relating to technological innovation and applied research .
i would just like to comment on one point .
i share the view that mr becsey ha just expressed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , at 12 noon .
however , those study are wrong on three count .
i wish to respond to some of the point raised .
it is a process of many issue around access to finance .
this will also help facilitate subsidy for the production of green product .
mr karas spoke on the small business act ( sba ) .
some member state are already monitoring and reporting on sba implementation .
one real problem lie with application of the rule by public buyer .
i want to underline one important thing , which is the legal basis .
there wa no reason to launch a specific consultation under the former article .
follow-up measure will be considered when the full assessment is completed in 2010 .
europe could be more innovative and creative in supporting smes .
madam president , commissioner , i should like to make four comment .
it is practically only abuse that are being recorded .
last year , the largest member state , germany , abandoned this theory .
some colleague asked why it is not legally binding .
it is not legally binding by nature for many reason .
i would just like to highlight two absolutely essential aspect .
access to funding is vital , along with the legal and administrative facility .
the second aspect is linked to the status of woman running small business .
in many respect , they do not differ significantly from employee .
they do not even benefit from the social insurance which employee enjoy .
suddenly , 150 employee are required in order to obtain employee representation .
in most other eu member state , the situation is even worse .
perhaps the commission 's proposal will be improved slightly in the forthcoming negotiation .
perhaps the text that is finally adopted will not be so bad .
in any case , we should ask ourselves the question 'why ' ?
could it perhaps be that there is something fundamentally wrong with the eu ?
future of the european common asylum system ( debate )
asylum seeker are vulnerable people who require appropriate reception condition .
i am pleased to learn that parliament fully share the commission 's philosophy .
frontex really need to be able to undertake this training task .
where , if need be , could they ask for asylum ?
i would really like to thank parliament for it support .
we must make the european union a true united common area of protection .
it is indeed my intention to include this in the stockholm programme .
in 2007 , the eu received more than 200 000 asylum application .
this is causing shopping-around by applicant and pass-the-parcel by state .
people should not be detained just because they apply for asylum .
the question of asylum is a very delicate one .
in summary , our eu procedure should be unified , transparent and fast .
this development is worrying , to say the least .
almost every week we hear horrific report from refugee camp in southern europe .
this is the issue we should instead be discussing here in parliament .
for what crime other than people trafficking is cooperation a requirement for asylum ?
all this is a recipe for chaos and gridlock in national asylum system .
commissioner , you will discover that the solidarity you seek will elude you .
the harmonisation of standard is definitely worthy of support .
we are currently in discussion with the member state on this important issue .
these same country are very often those sought by asylum seeker .
force can only be eliminated by striking at it root .
this is the subject of the report before you today .
i wish to thank you for your report , mr kósáné kovács .
if anything , it is a reason for concerted action .
the unusual reaction which we have seen in italy are a warning .
we can think about solution to problem or find the culprit .
a a representative of the left , i would rather we find solution .
commission action plan towards an integrated internal control framework ( short presentation )
in comparison , the amount recovered in 2007 wa 288 million .
vice-president kallas had the opportunity to discus this in parliament in january .
our last report show you that the commission ha completed the various action .
at the same time the institution need to have le complex legal requirement .
the challenging task is to find the right balance .
this is what the member state have done up to now .
in addition , their aim ha also been to maintain law and order .
3. cooperation between member state should be strengthened significantly ;
5. we need more research in the area ; and finally
it wa voted through with 32 vote in favour and 10 against .
however , this report provides some particularly useful clarification .
i am not a supporter but rather an opponent of internet gambling .
ensuring food quality : harmonisation or mutual recognition of standard ( short presentation )
the commission welcome the support for it policy of simplification toward trading standard .
the commission ha always been in favour of simplifying legislation where necessary .
a for geographic information , the commission share your view .
the procedure should be simplified or , at least , speeded up .
guideline might be sufficient and would avoid too many administrative constraint .
this is a first step towards a true quality policy for agricultural product .
but simplifying standard doe not mean le quality or authenticity .
eu food is distinguished by it high quality and correspondingly high standard .
the same can not always be said of imported good .
the ideal solution would be to use physical mean .
on the other hand , the whole area of training judge is vital .
what could we do to help them to achieve this ?
i think the task is quite a difficult one .
i want to carry on and briefly examine the outlook .
a request for the taking of evidence should normally be carried out quickly .
the report wa drawn up according to article 23 of the regulation .
however , it is imperative that it operation be improved .
obviously the courtroom will still need to be fitted with videoconferencing equipment .
the economic crisis ha taught u that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
mr doorn 's report ha certainly facilitated such an improvement .
i thank parliament for it support for these two initiative .
three or four point are mentioned in this regard .
that wa a brief summary of the substance of this report .
the question of transparency on oil reserve must be raised in this context .
the reorientation of energy policy is therefore the only way forward .
supporting nuclear energy or new mine in africa is not the solution .
commission report on competition policy 2006 and 2007 ( short presentation )
the brief presentation of her report will not therefore take place .
this is a problem of particular importance in ireland .
( the sitting wa closed at 10.55 p.m . )
i declare the 2008-2009 session of the european parliament closed .
i declare open the 2009-2010 session of the european parliament .
( the sitting wa opened at 9.05 a.m . )
i therefore encourage you to confirm this approval in this morning 's vote .
wednesday 11 march is the european day for the victim of terrorism .
it wa the day of the tragic attack in madrid .
type-approval requirement for the general safety of motor vehicle ( debate )
the cost to manufacturer will be far outweighed by the overall economic benefit .
that is , therefore , a really very noteworthy contribution .
not every issue wa covered , but that is the way with compromise .
the introduction of mandatory safety system for vehicle is something i particularly welcome .
we therefore have to see safety in another light here , too .
her car wa destroyed , but she walked away relatively unhurt .
that is the context in which we are discussing this report .
lane departure warning system and electronic stability control are also important .
the committee wa clear with regard to noise and health .
energy efficiency and co2 emission clearly play a very important role in this .
the alde group will be voting against this proposal for reason of principle .
madam president , i want to raise a related matter .
that is why it is so important that this is now quickly rectified .
please allow me to say something about the issue that mr doyle mentioned .
one part of these additional measure ha now been regulated .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
new technology will enable u to have safer , greener car .
at the heart of the compromise is the european safety network .
this concept introduces community-wide limit value for pollutant emission by industry .
these define clear requirement for the licensing of industrial installation .
this approach allows sufficient room to manoeuvre to set individual requirement .
that - and i will put this somewhat carefully - is an exaggeration .
best available technique is currently seeing judicious use in three member state .
where there may be danger , a closer look should be taken .
where nothing happens , there is no need for constant monitoring .
for many in this chamber , soil protection is a sore point .
analysis are required where relevant quantity of hazardous substance are actually handled .
it would be better left to the member state .
the calculation of threshold value for poultry farm is too bureaucratic .
the same applies to power generation from waste gas in steel production .
this process is very efficient and produce energy from an otherwise useless by-product .
furthermore , it is distorting competition between european industry .
the effort required in order to draft and approve them is considerable .
the best available technique are anything but correctly applied in this specific sector .
that is why the proposal merges seven current legislative act into one directive .
the system of control and testing ha become too diverse .
a mr krahmer said , it need to be amended .
greater effort is also required from the european commission , however .
personally , i am prepared to see a trade-off .
this also strengthens our supplier of green technology in europe .
you have negotiated all these compromise with u in a good way .
to conclude , i welcome the limitation and inclusion of provision on incinerator .
this is an important directive and i hope it will be adopted .
sometimes , it seems that this is the only environmental problem .
this is precisely where the greatest environmental gain are to be made .
i have tabled a couple of supplementary amendment , therefore .
recent case law ha shown this not to be the case .
the legislation is in need of repair , therefore .
in germany , we call this kind of nitpicking 'counting pea ' .
there must be efficient national law to deal with it .
we would also like to see a clear limit for carbon dioxide emission .
this directive is not the place to regulate small farm .
that is realistic and affordable and observes the principle of subsidiarity .
that amendment will save money at a critical time for health budget .
people have enough to blame the eu for without that !
i do not think this is a good idea .
i would ask all member to consider these point carefully before voting .
it implementation will get u where we need to go .
in practice this would even impair standard of environmental protection .
i am pleased that the amendment tabled by my group clear this up .
the amendment find a compromise on a large number of the hardest question .
the proposal is technology neutral and can be achieved by different mean .
i would like to thank mr jackson for her proposal for an amendment .
mr president , i will stick specifically to agriculture .
we already know that agriculture is under huge pressure .
we have heard many time in this chamber the question of food security .
please reconsider the amendment which are particularly damaging to it .
commissioner , you talked in your presentation about distorting competition .
mr president , i want to keep this short .
to conclude , i just have a couple more thing to say .
the problem is that that is exactly what we have not done .
at no point in the last four month ha this conversation taken place .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 2009 .
the 'best available technique ' principle should be reinforced in future .
public access to european parliament , council and commission document ( debate )
that will not happen and can not happen under my report .
parliament , council and commission are much more open now than ever before .
for this reason , a complete overhaul is not necessary .
having said this , even a good tool can always be improved .
the use of the recast technique meet the objective of better lawmaking .
we can not and will not prejudge or anticipate discussion or negotiation .
i look forward to an interesting and thought-provoking discussion to come .
mr president , transparency is the basis of democracy .
unfortunately , the european union can hardly brag about it transparency .
directive need to be changed , but so do attitude .
outsider , citizen if you like , should not be given them then .
i can not understand how european union citizen can be outsider .
that really is something that go against transparency and access to information .
together , we have pushed the current transparency legislation through .
what is on the table today will probably be modified after the election .
will the ppe-de group lose the three minute , or what ?
with this very interesting report , parliament is doing three thing .
first of all , it is taking reality into consideration .
public access must be the main principle , secrecy must be an exception .
commissioner wallström said that a good tool can always be improved .
we are not getting through , and new snow keep on coming .
rather , such people are often just people who ask question .
when we vote , everyone can look up how individual meps have voted .
all meps must also bear responsibility for the way they vote .
we will clarify the final position of our group tonight .
vice-president and commissioner wallström ha also fought hard and long .
mr president , access to information is one of the cornerstone of democracy .
accessing document is also a question of finding them .
the european union is undergoing systematic change and transformation .
they thought i wa the commissioner - perish the thought !
is this post-it note a document , for example ?
sometimes it is not helpful to make a definition too broad .
so we clarified and helped with the definition of document .
what about the record of political group meeting or preparation ?
commissioner , it is official document which are accessible .
go back and look at the report . the space to think .
openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government ' .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 march 2009 .
european citizen have every right to know what these argument and intervention are .
agreement between the ec and israel on certain aspect of air service (
commission action plan towards an integrated internal control framework (
implementation of directive 2006/43/ec on statutory audit of annual account and consolidated account (
equal treatment and access for men and woman in the performing art (
type-approval requirement for the general safety of motor vehicle (
he might like to have a word with mr corbett before answering .
at this time , we are still getting used to the recast rule .
we do not understand why some amendment are inadmissible .
could you clarify that a we proceed to the vote ?
we now have amendment 106 , 139 , 88 and 89 .
you all have a note to that effect in the voting list .
it chance of influence is in amending legislation put before u .
you can declare 'adopted ' or 'not adopted ' .
guideline for the 2010 budget procedure - section iii , commission (
i would ask parliament to support this oral amendment .
you could not hear this when mr surján read his text .
we would like to have that semi-colon between 'terrorism ' and 'immigration ' .
the oral amendment wa incorporated in the first of the four vote .
that is what it say on the voting list .
it wa incorporated in the first of the split vote and wa rejected .
i am not complaining if the pse group is not complaining .
i asked if there were any objection to the oral amendment .
ensuring food quality : harmonisation or mutual recognition of standard (
and mr beazley is a very devout member of the ppe-de group !
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
thank you , mr zaleski - the applause speaks for itself .
i would particularly like to highlight the issue regarding detention policy .
it is for that reason that i voted against the report .
we have concern in ireland about road safety issue .
better safety and more environmentally sensitive and sensible proposal are always welcome .
this mean competition on an equal footing throughout europe .
that should be the responsibility of the national government .
that is very confusing for people who have to deal with this legislation .
however , when it come to recasting , we have a difficulty .
maybe we should , a ha been suggested by one of our colleague .
i recently met with some producer in my constituency .
( nl ) mr president , i voted against this report .
however , this doe not mean that we must turn to protectionism .
yesterday i met a pensioner named ugo rossi , a retired craftsman .
a little later i met a retired lady , lucia annone .
these are not issue that the european parliament can underestimate .
mr president , we all know that gambling is a very emotive subject .
but it production requires a fair and competitive return .
this is what it seems to have come down to .
( sk ) mr president , i voted for mr herczog 's report .
we have 23 million smes in the european union .
smes are dynamic and have a great ability to innovate and develop .
the make a significant contribution towards implementing the lisbon objective .
credit and loan are the main source of finance for smes in europe .
99.2 % of my region 's business employ fewer than 49 people .
this initiative can curb unemployment and restart our economy .
i am sure it give you much le pleasure than it give u .
it is that sort of attitude that we need to tackle .
i agree with the rapporteur 's proposal that the agreement be signed .
romania must enjoy all the right and obligation of an eu member state .
this is what the u experiment show , in any case .
this view is shared by the european data protection supervisor .
creating the electronic system of travel authorisation is not justified financially .
the use of personal data is beneficial to public safety .
mr president , i supported giusto catani 's report .
we have supported this report today on that basis .
thank you , mr president , i voted in favour of the report .
we have therefore voted in favour of this report .
however , this is a 'yes ' vote with a clear proviso .
i voted for this report and mr gibault and i cooperated very well .
i am delighted to support this report which will benefit u all .
in writing . - we strongly support the original ippc directive .
on poultry , the ippc already control 40 000 poultry place .
i therefore warmly support the commission 's initiative and the rapporteur 's suggestion .
this afternoon , we voted on the statute for a european private company .
how is circumvention of useful national legislation to be prevented ?
i actually think this a much better idea than the european private company .
this is particularly true for smes , which have smaller structure .
moreover , the degree of employee representation within management is poor .
we would like to issue the following explanation , however .
worker participation is a cornerstone of a democratic and social europe .
the stipulation that a european private company really is active across border .
new firm mean new workplace , and hence economic recovery .
it will provide an attractive alternative to national regulation .
sector that have performed poorly must also be subsidised .
this is not a necessary cost given the current situation .
in writing . - i support a more open gaming environment in europe .
online gambling offer a new way for consumer to enjoy their gaming experience .
i believe that the alternative resolution would have addressed those concern more effectively .
consumer protection is vitally important to all the member state .
many people in the european union enjoy online gambling .
we must ensure that these people are safe from harm on line .
i have therefore chosen to wholeheartedly endorse the schaldemose report .
i believe that conducting an information campaign on this issue is essential .
these system should not be made uniform or merged into one .
the promotion of specifically european agricultural and food product .
that way , regulation and quality control for agricultural product will become easier .
only , the term 'healthy food ' doe itself appear to be paradoxical .
can anything that is not healthy to human be described a 'food ' ?
food product must also be properly packed , transported and stored .
ultimately , consumer have to be able to rely on labelling .
huge progress ha been made in the field of competition over recent year .
these element make it impossible for ukip to support this proposal .
therefore , implementing the sba strengthens the aspect of competitiveness .
these element make it impossible for ukip to support this proposal .
they account for almost 99 % of all enterprise in the eu .
i also support the idea of having a specific budget line for smes ...
that is something which i can not and do not support .
if the big company fold , the little one will inevitably follow .
we must also examine the current financial condition faced by smes .
that is why there is a need for anticyclical policy at european level .
the south-east of england should benefit from such an approach .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
lastly , i will move on to my own report .
in my opinion , all this form a successful whole .
we have spent 10 year working on this , then .
this time , we are doing so without the pressure of a disaster .
i should like to express my warm thanks to him posthumously .
until recently , it wa managed through various set of regulation .
the establishment of these rule wa absolutely not an end in itself .
others attempt to exclude the possibility of maritime disaster occurring .
however , despite all technical measure , large-scale accident can occur .
the establishment of objective investigatory commission clearly ha a place here .
unfortunately , the incident that set the process in motion made it clear .
i would like to thank mr tajani and the commission .
that , lady and gentleman , is why we have succeeded .
at the time of first reading , parliament adopted some amendment .
my own proposal and that of mr savary remained to be agreed .
my participation in this process wa a great honour .
they are capable of sending out a message to guarantee safety .
they are capable of sending out a message to protect the environment .
i want to thank the french presidency and the slovenian presidency .
other device will be applied to the port state .
shipping company must take out adequate third party and passenger liability insurance policy .
so i believe that this is our common goal .
that is something we should say in the election campaign , too .
mr vice-president , all eye are on you , now !
these report have been modified , but not for the better .
in fact , there is now contradiction between them .
finally , the fernandes report endorses various imo recommendation .
in other word , the mountain ha brought forth a mouse .
there is already a great deal of experience with this in aviation .
the rapporteur ha done an excellent job in this regard .
the framework for dealing with problem involving hazardous waste is important .
what we have now is more transparency and stricter inspection .
( ro ) the third maritime package is extremely important .
will the commission be able to ensure they are complied with ?
that will ensure that the decision made are rigorous , right and fair .
we should be pleased at the fact that parliament ha shown this leadership .
if their quality is below par , you must take action .
i would like to thank everyone who ha collaborated on this package .
fortunately , some of the rule will immediately come into force .
of course a soon a one chapter close , another one immediately open .
we could say much more , but there would not be much point .
we hope that they will be adopted in their current form tomorrow .
i also thank everyone for your comment and contribution .
no one ha yet been made to answer for this .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
this should bring u one step closer to a more sustainable transport system .
i wish to add straight away that this is no miracle cure .
it wa not easy ; point of view differed very widely .
firstly , which externality are to be introduced into the system ?
we opted for the area of air pollution , noise and congestion .
fourthly , there must be the possibility of further action in future .
overall , the impact of all of this is actually limited .
it must then apply to everything from the railway to marine transport .
you know , it is the same story with the eurovignette .
so help u do this - propose something really tangible !
we are staunch supporter of investment in sustainable transport .
the council will not accept that - so much is already clear .
the cost incurred by traffic congestion are rising to 1 % of gdp .
the revenue thus generated must be used to reduce the external cost .
this is an essential component of parliament 's position .
if this doe not happen , we no longer have a compromise .
in my view , this would be very important in resolving the problem .
the cost are not new - they have been around for some time .
the burden are well enough known to all of u .
the government ha created a dense network of ever wider motorway .
this encourages even more transport and increase the environmental impact still further .
decision taken on this in 2006 have yielded insufficient result .
europe must not repeat such error by member state .
we can not allow member state to introduce a kind of punitive tax .
amendment 40 will therefore have to be removed from the report .
this is essential to my support for the eurovignette directive .
in addition , this proposal must not remain isolated .
this is a fair way of encouraging haulier to clean up their act .
the imposition of such regulatory charge is a national competence .
we , the commission and parliament , want to do that .
we improved the proposal in the committee on transport and tourism .
europe can not and should not regulate everything and in every detail .
tomorrow , this item will be voted on again a amendment 40 .
mr president , i will speak on the el khadraoui report .
until recently , road and other infrastructure were paid for only by taxpayer .
the present eurovignette applies the 'user pay ' principle .
the commissioner said that mountain region are opposing the single market .
and what is this about it being a single market ?
you ca n't have it both way , however .
everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true cost .
it is wrong to continue to promote the unhealthy and bloated transport economy .
the 20-20-20 target will otherwise grow ever more distant .
we must be clear that this dishonesty jeopardises the future of our grandchild .
he ha achieved a workable compromise under really difficult condition .
i hope that we will receive the necessary majority to achieve that breakthrough .
the sectoral driving ban in austria are a good example of this .
a few tricky point remain under discussion , however .
road freight transport is an important driving force for our economy .
transport ha always been the lifeblood of the whole economy .
let u not make them pay for the upkeep of the country .
the eu ha had a mandatory rail toll since the mid-1990s .
we have not chosen measure that encourage more sustainable carriage of good .
they need to have a range of tool at their disposal .
it should remain a matter solely for national and local determination .
internalising external cost for pollution and noise is a positive measure .
a mr lichtenberger put it , 'there is documented evidence ' .
mr o'neachtain expressed reservation and concern about ireland and other peripheral country .
he seems not to understand that this is optional on member state .
it will only apply in ireland if his government actually decides it .
it is important for u to support this when we vote tomorrow .
we must explain to them how this initiative came about .
consumer will see how product price will rise when these charge are implemented .
modal change remains a dream and is far from becoming reality .
otherwise , we will always have imbalance in this regard .
i therefore think that this will be a beneficial text .
the question of job is a completely different issue .
this directive , however , ha absolutely nothing to do with that .
in any case , the eurovignette is not compulsory .
however , different stance , different idea naturally emerged in our discussion .
having said this , i believe that the council will make amendment .
mr president , i wish to make a couple of comment .
with all due respect , that is completely wrong .
we should not be deterred by this one bit .
let u simply go for a position we support 100 % .
to make business pay for congestion caused by the member state is nonsensical .
another way to prevent congestion is through intelligent traffic system .
there are lot of modern technology capable of preventing congestion .
you see , you said you do not want any new tax .
the following question have been submitted to the commission .
is this something that can be considered , and where are we heading ?
mr president , what mr rack ha just proposed is an interesting idea .
subject : more flexible interpretation of the stability and growth pact
the pact doe not provide an explicit definition of these special circumstance .
the ecofin adopted it opinion on these report this morning .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , i have two brief question .
should this question not be linked to a certain level of success ?
ha there been a change in the rule of procedure ?
mr doyle , we will actually finish at 8 p.m. a intended .
doe the honourable member not have a supplementary question ?
do you wish to pose your supplementary question mr doyle ?
i understood you were only giving it to the questioner and one other .
they only exist because the eu allows them to do so .
these are her word : 'a resolute policy against tax evasion ' .
incitement to racial hatred is a crime in all eu member state .
this year , it will present a recommendation on medium literacy .
i know you have looked into it in great detail .
the evidence so far is that they are increasing a we speak .
do you feel that we should take further action ?
however , there are also more and more site being constructed .
now to the murder question which the honourable member underlined .
crime ha to be fought and it ha to be fought very strongly .
subject : information and communication technology ( ict ) and information society
for instance , only 15 % of older people use the internet .
in 2008 , the commission adopted two other initiative .
you can see a lot of the work they do .
i am referring in this case to the public key infrastructure .
is the commission able to do anything about this ?
question no 37 and 40 will receive answer in writing .
i would recall the convention on cybercrime and it additional protocol .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her reply .
i could have printed that off from the internet myself .
i will state very plainly what i wa getting at with my question .
we have established permanent , close contact with him .
the commissioner ha rightly said that this is a criterion for serbia .
we know that that is the case for croatia .
question no 43 and 44 will receive answer in writing .
subject : turkish-funded usurpation of greek cypriot property in the occupied territory of cyprus
what view doe the commission take of this policy being followed by turkey ?
is it acceptable on the part of a country seeking eu membership ?
what , at long last , is to be done ?
how are we supposed to put up with this situation year after year ?
subject : opening of the 'energy ' chapter in the accession negotiation with turkey
will the commission take step to ensure that this negotiating chapter is opened ?
question no 47 and 48 will receive answer in writing .
our point of view ha not changed on this matter .
thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer them together .
we have already introduced private storage earlier than we normally do .
export refund for the dairy sector were further alleviated recently .
i do not underestimate the difficulty in the dairy sector .
thank you for your very detailed reply , commissioner .
many dairy farmer are hanging on by their fingernail .
i would like you to clarify that for me , please .
however , a she understands , milk producer are having major difficulty .
farmer can not continue to produce milk under the current condition .
and yet time is the one thing we do not have .
is it not time to be bold with the export refund ?
because , commissioner , our industry is dying on it foot .
i completely agree on the three reason for the situation .
there seems to be unanimity now in the council on this issue .
the next item is the commission statement on childcare facility - barcelona objective .
the aim is to offer this option to parent who want it .
childcare facility also contribute to child 's development , of course .
in this way , we can also ensure well-prepared and competent labour force .
( the president asked the speaker to speak more slowly )
in parliament , the subject of child is spread across all the committee .
far too little attention is paid to this at present .
yet , commissioner špidla , you have said that there are funding opportunity .
what else will the commission do to encourage the member state ?
you have also hinted that there are possibility of co-financing .
are these possibility being used by the member state ?
i think that , together , we should bear this in mind .
woman have been a wonderful addition to the workforce .
their inclusion and equal treatment is a matter of fundamental right .
there are always consequence when we go against nature .
it also brings advantage for child in term of their healthy development .
the situation with childcare in slovakia is rather complicated .
they are also a requirement for the promotion of equality .
yet woman have the same right a men to professional fulfilment .
in addition , the number of single-parent family is on the rise .
when parent emigrate for work , these child are also left alone .
this is where it is vital for staff to have professional training .
it is the question of which social model we wish to promote .
my country , bulgaria , offer a high level of childcare .
will we then invest in the child of europe ?
in this case , i recommend the following action :
1. increase the involvement of national government in this problem ,
we need , like never before , to invest in our child .
i urge the commissioner to keep the pressure on .
( pl ) madam president , nursery are an evil .
they may be a necessary evil , but they are an evil .
it all sound so logical and modern , socialist , even .
in this area , there is no progress or revolutionary change .
there are even organisation that seek to defend them !
it is that which our society also need to do .
let u move forward with a fair view of the family !
in the new perspective , it is explicitly possible for the first time .
it is starting to be documented and it ha also attracted medium attention .
member state must reinforce preventative measure and focus on the most vulnerable family .
we know that country which have bilateral relation can have the family connection .
one such film wa shown here in parliament and we saw the situation .
it is therefore hypocritical of u to say that we have no evidence .
if one part of the body hurt , the whole body hurt .
it is about time this issue wa discussed in parliament .
an impact assessment is an urgent and necessary requirement .
better information must be produced on child 's right and schooling .
madam president , the european commission should focus on this issue .
so we expect concrete action from the commission in such an important field .
i believe that this situation could be improved through adopting the following measure :
these service should be accessible to every migrant worker segment .
( ro ) i would like to highlight one thing .
it is a topical subject which is hugely important for the future .
however , these were migrant living in condition of extreme poverty at home .
it is often not extreme poverty that motivates parent to work abroad .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 2009 .
the commission would like to raise several point in connection with this situation .
leaving qimonda to it fate will have extremely serious consequence .
we hope that the commission will focus on that .
nonetheless , that could mean that not all the job are retained .
this is where the european globalisation adjustment fund come in .
there is not much time left , just a few day .
lady and gentleman , let u help save qimonda .
a for u , we will continue this fight .
mr president , i commend the priority given to this debate .
this ha to be treated seriously by policy maker .
that is also what we expect from the commission .
it is essential that the commission not shy away .
overcapacity ha been identified for some time a a key driver of overfishing .
the introduction of the fishing plan i have already mentioned is another measure .
furthermore , the derogation to minimum size are adjusted .
indeed , only bait boat still benefit from previous derogation .
in the mediterranean , the artisanal coastal fishery now benefit from a derogation .
mr president , the time ha come to speak clearly .
however , there are two point in the new regulation which bother me :
perhaps the possibility of community assistance in this direction could be examined .
i hope that we will be able to deliver on this plan .
( the sitting wa closed at 11.20 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9 a.m . )
the policeman who wa killed wa married and had child .
terrorism is a direct attack on freedom , human right and democracy .
it is a direct attack on our citizen , on all of u .
we can not repeat often enough that there is no justification for terrorism .
we would like to express our solidarity with them .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
on the contrary , their importance is obvious to u all .
we have avoided a meltdown of the financial system .
our top priority now is the restoration of credit flow to the economy .
cross-border bank hold up to 80 % of europe 's banking asset .
strengthening supervision is , therefore , important in itself .
of course , deficit inevitably swell in time of economic recession .
automatic stabiliser can , to some extent , play a positive role .
some member state have already made effort towards consolidation .
this will also be an important message from next week 's meeting .
the financial crisis is now affecting the real economy .
of course , member state ' response are different .
the european council will ass the state of implementation of this programme .
which lead me to the g20 summit meeting in london .
they will also be looking at the particular challenge facing developing country .
it mean taking adequate measure to improve energy efficiency .
we must create a fully fledged internal market for electricity and gas .
we remain committed to a global , comprehensive agreement in copenhagen next december .
the commission 's january communication is a very helpful basis .
finally , the european council will also launch the eastern partnership .
the partnership includes a bilateral dimension which is adapted to each partner country .
we are facing many serious challenge , not least the current economic crisis .
it destroys job and test the resistance of our social model .
it also put strong political pressure on all the leader .
the european union is not immune from such tension .
this will be the mission for the european council next week .
yes , we need immediate action to address immediate problem .
the money ha to come , essentially , from national budget .
the single market is the best possible platform for recovery .
we will also carry more weight on the global stage .
bankruptcy are still occurring and unemployment is continuing to rise .
never before ha the european project been subject to such a tough test .
the problem at the moment is the lack of ability to act .
they must , therefore , be integrated into the discussion .
i think that we have done too little , too late .
you have mentioned them and they are particularly important .
i would also like to say something about young people .
young people are currently becoming unemployed straight from education .
otherwise , we are storing up problem for the future .
thank you , mr president , mr vondra and mr barroso .
i would like to dwell on the basic message conveyed in this report .
the analysis of the mistake made and experience gained must continue .
in addition , the process of simplifying the procedure must continue .
we believe that the unused margin should not be used .
social cohesion mean being integrated into the labour market .
europe is obliged to innovate if it is to survive globalisation .
european are expecting concrete signal from it , a is my parliamentary group .
however , a strong europe must not be a protectionist europe .
this is the europe of jean monnet and of all the founding father .
our fellow citizen sometimes ask what the purpose of europe is .
this would give a real industrial boost to the economic recovery .
this is the meaning of the lisbon and , now , post-lisbon strategy .
this prevents u from engaging in demagogy and populism .
this obliges u to speak honestly to the people of europe .
i hope that the next european council will take inspiration from this approach .
this also indicates the nature of his attitude to the current situation .
we have heard many of the old familiar phrase being repeated .
mr daul , i would like to congratulate you on your wonderful speech !
it is really wonderful and it all sound excellent .
however , now we actually need to deliver something .
the crisis is deepening and job are being lost .
this mean that people 's livelihood are being destroyed .
this mean that company are being threatened with closure .
this mean that national economy are being threatened with collapse .
you must tell the absent president-in-office of the council this .
mr barroso , you have made a wonderful speech .
solidarity between people in society , but also solidarity between state .
and their underlying message is this : job , job , job .
nor should we accept heel-dragging over the need to protect the planet .
mr barroso , nothing wa done in response to this request .
my view of this is slightly different to that of my fellow member .
every year , we hear many comforting assurance on this subject .
despite all of the measure adopted to date , unemployment is rising .
i am not the only one who think that something is wrong .
this is one of the historical fact in this area .
we should not discus this until we are blue in the face .
please do not paint too rosy a picture of europe . '
however , that is exactly what you are doing .
when you talk about automatic stabiliser , it is already in the prognosis .
how could you imagine respect for the european union ?
if we do not do that , we will lose .
this is precisely what is needed to recover from a recession .
if not , the eu will lose it credibility .
now is the time for u to show solidarity and innovation .
first , we should not squander these eur 5 billion on state aid .
instead , we should concentrate the money on the european investment bank .
we need higher minimum wage and better social service in europe .
i believe that social justice is now the only sensible economic policy .
it is the only way of bringing this disastrous crisis to an end .
the lisbon strategy is a good idea that ha been botched .
the euro is a bad idea that ha exacerbated the problem .
is it a case of european solidarity or support for the state ?
i welcome these move towards a more intensive approach and flexibility .
this applies to all the region across all the member state .
mr president , i would like to start by responding to mr farage .
we will commit fund to save knowledge throughout ipr policy .
this is what people in the street are waiting for from u .
the number of employee taking so-called voluntary redundancy is increasing .
they are left without a job , without social or financial support .
i urge the commission and member state to unite on this important matter .
therefore , the proposed economic stimulus instrument should certainly receive our support .
even investment in ailing economic structure seems to be a possibility .
what you are offering in the new document is unacceptable .
after all , economic growth and low inflation provided scope for reform .
that wa an agreement between you and me , wa it not ?
i appreciate the consensus in parliament that your policy wa wrong .
mr president , what we need now is stability .
that is the way we can achieve more job .
( nl ) mr president , this crisis is a test for europe .
europe is not the sum total of 27 time the national interest .
the objective of the lisbon strategy should not be put on ice .
only with actual european and future-oriented solution can we meet this crisis head-on .
for that strategy to be effective , it must fulfil the following condition .
do a delors and use this work a a basis for implementation !
the european consensus that we have sought for year ha therefore been found .
support based on eu fund should now be aimed at the targeted area .
the committee ha taken full account of our amendment .
this mean that we , the 27 member state , must act together .
secondly , we need to develop genuine solidarity between the 27 member state .
we said that should take place in all new car model from 2011 .
this , of course , is not by chance .
the recovery plan is essentially a toolbox to promote restructuring .
europe must act to define a clear , innovative economic strategy .
doing nothing and letting the market decide ha failed .
we want to act and we want to act decisively .
the task is therefore great , and we must not err or procrastinate .
we can not accept that country should run up national debt without limitation .
in europe , we agreed to the so-called stability and growth pact .
we also need to increase our reserve of oil and natural gas .
this is particularly important for the european union 's poorer member state .
what is the cost of borrowing they would have to pay ?
the lithuanian litas ha already been pegged to the euro for 4 year .
this will mean real kilometre of road , modernised railway line and airport .
i would like to respond to the comment made by mr lehne .
will you vote for or against the ferreira report ?
( de ) madam president , thank you very much .
firstly , of course , the socialist are not responsible for the crisis .
the question is simply at which point we vote in favour of it .
therefore , i have no problem with the question that have been mentioned .
we intend to address that issue at next week 's meeting .
it is a key part of the lisbon strategy .
graham watson asked how much we will have to pay .
however , it would be premature to give an estimate now .
to open the account now would not be the correct tactical move .
i am sorry for once to have to contradict mr juncker .
at the moment , we do not even know that .
we must take the appropriate political measure in this respect .
this really is not about dividend for shareholder or bonus for manager .
the financial measure that we take must support these objective .
this mean that we must help them to obtain funding .
however , it ha now reached the limit of what it can do .
however , what is parliament asking of the council ?
the downturn is becoming larger than we thought at the start .
there will be higher unemployment and greater social consequence .
this is like shooting the pianist if you do not like the song .
it is now that we need to do this .
we can not wait until the summit in may .
the employment issue must be top of the agenda right now .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 11 march .
secondly , priority ha to be given to three strategy :
increasing investment in human capital through enhanced skill and better education .
this simply prof that europe ha to learn to use it potential .
indeed , solidarity is an absolute must to get through this crisis .
i represent romania in the european parliament , a country in south-eastern europe .
at present , solidarity between member state is of paramount importance .
reducing very large imbalance is , fundamentally , sound .
but how this is done doe matter to the utmost .
pro-cyclicality ha to be averted both during an upswing and a downswing .
just remember the lesson from the asian crisis a decade ago .
just cutting budget deficit drastically would not help much in this regard either .
hopefully , future ecofin meeting would enhance better approach regarding financial assistance .
we are living in a period of economic uncertainty .
country which help bank financially are not eliminating the cause of the crisis .
it is necessary to create incentive to attract capital investment .
these are the root cause of the irreparable capitalist crisis .
all member state need to be involved equally in decision making .
protectionism can not be the answer to the economic crisis .
however , the mutually felt pain mobilises resource and intention .
the ghost of protectionism doe not offer good advice !
we must make effective use of every opportunity available to u .
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very creditable report .
it is an opportunity to reorganise the whole pan-european and global financial architecture .
europe can not just be the sum of 27 national interest .
it is important that the eu should make condition more flexible .
it is now difficult to get loan to make those expenditure .
regional policy is the primary source of european investment in the real economy .
in other word we produce document which we do not then implement .
the deadline for tabling amendment is 3 p.m. this afternoon .
i am conscious that there are many differing view across this house .
there are 150 000 people trapped with no way out .
vat exemption on the final importation of certain good (
europol staff : adjustment of basic salary and allowance (
common rule and standard for ship inspection and survey organisation ( recast ) (
the liability of carrier of passenger by sea in the event of accident (
the charging of heavy good vehicle for the use of certain infrastructure (
public access to european parliament , council and commission document (
the commission confirms it willingness to seek a compromise with parliament and council .
we then voted on amendment 27 , which ha been adopted .
madam president , a very brief amendment to the original text .
at the moment , it read 'reducing emission for deforestation and degradation ' .
i want to change the word 'for ' to 'from ' .
we never use the word 'the disabled ' in english .
( fr ) madam president , this is a purely technical amendment .
until a few minute ago , thing looked quite different .
( applause from the left and protest from the right )
( de ) madam president , one item relating to the agenda .
or did he speak a the chairman of the group ?
( it ) madam president , i would like some clarification .
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
we must also make sure that we avoid protectionism in europe .
lorry transport provides a service to the whole economy , including the citizen .
the basic assumption we have to make is that decision making is transparent .
transparency must apply at each administrative level with regard to document .
were we able to debate these in an open and transparent manner ?
i believe that my country should withdraw from the eu 's social chapter .
however , at least this save our taxpayer some of the unnecessary waste .
i can assure them they are missing very little .
we have previously made commitment in this house to reduce emission .
this is unfortunate because there are some good proposal .
much more could have been done for the aviation sector , however .
then we might achieve this objective perhaps by 2020 or 2030 .
i am always reticent when it come to these sort of report .
it is just that we never seem to arrive .
it is about time we were honest with ourselves and admitted that .
it is time the looter of government stopped draining the life-blood of company .
i do not normally speak here just for the sake of being negative .
however , across europe we still face a chronic skill crisis .
we have a perfectly good chamber back in brussels .
we are here for only three or four day per month .
they travel and cause carbon emission while they are getting here .
we are possibly the least green parliament that there is .
or let u put that the other way around : pluralism guarantee competitiveness .
but those good year have come to an end .
i just wonder if this report is actually heading in the right direction .
having read it , i am pretty sure that it is not .
however , thing have changed now , and the money is running out .
integration rest on their sufferance , and they have now seen through this .
they are not responding any more to the unspoken appeal to historical responsibility .
i believe that the environmental disaster that struck romania can not go unheeded .
fortunately , that disaster did not have the same destructive power or scale .
nonetheless , i fully endorse this tangible evidence of european solidarity .
substandard vessel sailing under flag of convenience are slashing transport price .
a such , i confirm my vote in favour .
i agree with the objective of the 3rd maritime package .
for these reason , we abstained in the final vote on this report .
i agree with the objective of the 3rd maritime package .
i agree with the objective of the 3rd maritime package .
this is why i voted in favour of the report .
ireland is an island that is situated at the edge of europe .
these are issue that we can not afford to ignore .
in the final vote , i voted against adoption of the directive .
moreover , it will not contribute to environmental protection .
during this time of financial crisis , it is kind of absurd .
i am voting in favour of the reasonable compromise on the new eurovignette .
i will introduce this proposal again during further discussion on this subject .
a a result , a higher brenner toll will be possible .
i believe it is counterproductive to penalise someone who is stuck in congestion .
soon , it will be the polluter who pay .
it is good to revisit this regulation after seven year of practical experience .
accordingly , document on trade negotiation are deemed confidential .
ultimately , this is a choice between the devil and the deep-blue sea .
i am very concerned for my country , italy .
we must join force : a coordinated european approach is crucial .
that is why i voted in favour of the report .
in other word , there is a forecast loss of 3.5 million job .
we must do everything we can to avoid mass unemployment .
for this reason , i have voted against the report .
the current crisis is more than just an economic and financial crisis .
it is , above all , a crisis of confidence .
it most dramatic sign is the high level of unemployment .
in this respect , our vote can only be against this decision .
i am very concerned about the recent event in italy .
the italian government is engaged in an obsessive security campaign .
we have therefore voted in favour of this report .
we welcome cooperation between member state in dealing with these huge problem .
the rom community is europe 's largest and most disadvantaged minority group .
oil demand management must not be limited to the eu alone .
we must ensure that these measure are applied in an equitable manner .
with these reservation , i am pleased to support the report .
this is a small step towards a major objective .
the jarzembowski report , however , would weaken the commission proposal .
a such , i have voted against this report .
in writing . - i support measure towards a greening of transport .
this will help u in our fight against climate change .
however , specific measure need to be strengthened and i had to abstain .
it is essential to halt the current rise in unemployment in the eu .
a a result , what wa needed wa a break with these policy .
who can be against such a simple and effective measure ?
we must also keep to the barcelona target on childcare .
needle to say , such action will strain financial resource .
i voted in favour of the european parliament resolution on combating climate change .
this resolution contains positive aspect , which we value .
i agree with some point of the resolution on combating climate change .
i have therefore decided to abstain and not to vote on this matter .
this must be a priority during the financial crisis .
in writing . - ( sv ) this resolution contains many deserving exhortation .
i voted against the motion for a resolution on employment policy guideline .
member insist that all financial aid must be timely , targeted and temporary .
the bail out of the bank wa a necessary but not sufficient step .
data from the last few week do not engender optimism .
in writing . - ( fr ) exceptional situation call for exceptional resource .
the same can be said for the european commission .
transparency , open bookkeeping and supervision must render tax haven impossible .
in writing . - the financial crisis is the first test of globalisation .
i urge the commission to initiate the relevant procedure a soon a possible .
insisted on increasing the structural fund and the cohesion fund ;
i would like to make this statement now with your consent .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the problem is therefore not technical , but political .
now let me turn to the subject of our debate today .
firstly , we are grateful for the opportunity to have this debate .
this is an important issue , a you all know well .
this wa incorporated into article 19 of the council regulation of 24 october .
mr president , i wish to confirm what mr vondra ha said .
we are therefore able to continue this feasibility study into an alternative solution .
a copy of this correspondence ha also been sent to mr coelho .
romania 's external border is 2 000 km long .
all this indecision may have consequence in term of meeting this deadline .
i know this , because i am from poland .
i should like to close with a very small remark .
we have always kept the citizen of europe informed .
i have participated in these debate from the very beginning .
the council , under our leadership , did what it could in january .
no - the system must be operational a soon a possible .
i shall limit myself to these few concluding remark .
it is not , a mr vondra said , a political problem .
that , then , is the commitment : eur 68 million .
the information technology , however , ha to be in place .
the next item is the council and the commission statement on :
former yugoslav republic of macedonia : progress report 2008 .
your report rightly state that croatia made good progress over the past year .
the presidency will continue to take forward the negotiation .
we had a lunch just before the sitting to discus this in depth .
that said , despite good progress , much remains to be done .
a professional , accountable , transparent and independent public administration is also key .
work on ensuring the sustainability of refugee return must continue .
this also go for legislation to improve the right of minority .
you have rightly highlighted the issue of regional cooperation in your report .
let me now turn to the issue of turkey .
the ratification of the protocol to the convention against torture is vital .
despite all these difficulty , progress continues in a range of area .
finally , let me turn to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
at the same time , it face a number of significant challenge .
both these point are brought out admirably in your report .
personally , i hope that positive development can be achieved soon .
these point will be evaluated by the commission in it next progress report .
we look forward to this report , and to further development in skopje .
mr swoboda 's draft resolution address the main challenge which face croatia today .
that wa the message i took to both ljubljana and zagreb in january .
we agreed to continue the talk in the near future .
there are two equally important conclusion to this statement in the un charter .
the commission 's initiative is , without doubt , among these method .
i sincerely hope that this will happen sooner , rather than later .
croatia ha made progress in a number of area .
there have been dispute about different chain of command and the corresponding document .
thirdly , croatia ha also made some move towards economic reform .
it ha not been easy , but the important foundation have been laid .
i have sent you the document and you have failed to respond .
it is clear that movement is needed on both side .
the wording of your original proposal wa not ideal .
this would perhaps have allowed u to achieve more by working together .
the key issue of the debate is how we can make progress .
the two side must agree to move in this direction .
i hope that we will then achieve positive result .
political reform and meeting the copenhagen criterion are absolute priority .
mr president , more must be done in those area .
mr president , turkey should not prescribe these political criterion on our behalf .
this is why the political criterion are now central in our report .
this , too , ha been included in the report .
moreover , i very much appreciate turkey 's positive role in the caucasus .
i should like to make a few more point , mr president .
in 2011 , croatia must be able to be a fully-fledged member state .
i wa present at the election and they were exemplary .
there were difficulty with a tiny minority within the minority .
the border problem is exactly the same a when slovenia joined .
i would in any case like this wording to ... .
i should like to mention a few point from this excellent report .
we are still not happy with what is happening over there .
recently , there wa an internet campaign concerning armenia and the genocide .
i should like to finish off with one last remark .
commissioner rehn ha spoken in somewhat optimistic term about the negotiation in cyprus .
for this to happen , however , further effort are necessary .
it is still possible that we can keep to the original timetable .
that is how i understand the turkish statement on nabucco .
in that respect , all credit to the rapporteur .
the will to reform from 2004 will need to return .
then , and only then , can we talk about their accession .
the main problem is the matter of the name .
there is a problem with the stabilisation of political institution in macedonia .
we in the european parliament are going to monitor these election closely .
let u resolve this outstanding issue promptly and sensibly .
development in turkey are a matter for concern to liberal and democrat .
i should like if i may to say something else about this debate .
i think we should restructure this debate , and soon .
we would lose credibility and the credibility of europe would be set back .
this ha even become the subject of occasional ridicule in turkey .
the balance sheet of more than three year of negotiation is positively lamentable .
the remaining reform in the judiciary referred to are being tackled .
with slovenia , there is the question of bilateral border dispute .
commissioner , you suddenly referred to 'european border dispute ' .
the candidate country macedonia ha also made huge progress .
( c ) i would like to make a few comment .
( sl ) we in the alde group support mr meier 's report .
what this country need is a date for the beginning of negotiation .
they deserve the opportunity to show their merit during the accession process .
in fact , you could say that time is money .
allow me also to say a few word about croatia .
turkey ha not taken step either to strengthen the impartiality of judicial institution .
domestic violence and forced marriage continue to be common .
conflict broke out recently in school in struga between albanian- and macedonian-speaking parent .
we have to stop the hypocrisy and the pretence .
turkey is not a european country , either geographically or culturally .
the people of europe do not want turkey in europe .
let u respect our people and show respect for europe !
what happens , though , to those woman when they leave the shelter ?
i should also like to draw your attention to the fight against fraud .
i salute croatia 's many new achievement on this occasion , too .
i would like to see this happen a soon a possible .
secondly , it must respect freedom of speech and thought .
in so doing , turkey will itself facilitate it way towards accession .
mr panayotopoulos-cassiotou , i think that the commissioner ha heard you .
i will have the opportunity of meeting the turkish negotiator tomorrow in prague .
i think that joost lagendijk , rightly , said this .
we are working on that in order to facilitate such an agreement .
i should like to thank you for your support for this initiative .
the vote will take place tomorrow , 12 march 2009 .
i congratulate mr oomen-ruijten for this excellently drafted report .
enlargement is one of the great success of the modern european union .
the turkish question ha always been surrounded by misgiving and mistrust .
promoting diversification is most urgent in the area of gas supply .
to sign and ratify the european charter for regional or minority language ,
the mandate of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( debate )
it is also key to strengthening the rule of law in the region .
yet it wa clear that they had to be addressed .
no contract , no agreement , no society can be sustainable without justice .
a central element of that policy is cooperation with the icty .
sap conditionality is monitored through the annual progress report prepared by the commission .
the next progress report will be published in october 2009 .
that will take place in brussels in early april , next month .
i look forward to continuing to work together with parliament in this regard .
nobody can claim any longer that the guilty get off scot-free .
this applies to all country from which suspect hail .
we would not be credible if we did not hold firm to this .
this is , after all , one of the copenhagen criterion .
the socialist group ha proposed two amendment to plenary .
i thank the rapporteur , and i commend these amendment to the house .
that ha led to confusion and a consistent postponement of deadline .
this is something that is also stressed in mr neyts 's report .
certainly , this tribunal will not be able to continue it work indefinitely .
that wa all the more reason to come forward with these proposal .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , 12 march 2009 .
simply voting against this despicable report doe not suffice .
the greek communist party ha abstained from the vote .
the next item is question time ( b6-0009/2009 ) to the council .
subject : improvement of quality , availability and financing of long-term care
priority attention will also be paid to independent living in the community .
the conference should contribute to the exchange of best practice .
let me conclude with the recent development in the area of taxation .
unfortunately , in reality , there are not enough relative to do so .
on the contrary , we need an increasing number of highly trained staff .
i think member state could provide training and counselling opportunity to family carers .
finally , social protection for family carers is also important .
the committee 's finding are being passed on to the council .
the presidency support the implementation of the flexicurity principle .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his response .
what is the council presidency doing to counter this ?
we have the european economic recovery plan and we need to implement it .
the european community imposes high-level standard through which we protect our consumer .
the forthcoming european council is also expected to agree key political message .
it is most important that we have a record of such important declaration .
yes , of course , we need to find common ground .
there is the economic crisis ; there are those ambitious environmental goal .
at the same time , a lot of public explanation lie ahead .
what plan doe the presidency have to tackle this issue ?
traffic intensity and the related danger are a top priority for u .
( ro ) the eu ha not done enough to reduce road accident .
it is also and primarily the responsibility of the driver behind the wheel .
green paper on the european workforce for health ( debate )
the next item is the green paper on the european workforce for health .
i also look forward to receiving contribution from the member of this parliament .
those will really facilitate our work and serve our common objective .
i refer to directive 2005/36/ec , which is now in force .
furthermore , an extension of imi to all regulated profession is envisaged .
if i may say so , i think that is half the question .
the other half is why so many are leaving .
i think we have to look at the career structure that we provide .
we have to see how promotion is seen a a potential .
we have to ensure that the work environment is pleasant .
it is going to be tough but it can be comfortable a well .
perhaps , above all , we have to listen to the sharp-end professional .
i think that is something we need to look at more .
therefore , they do not go back to work there .
we need to look at the safety of health professional .
it is precisely the economy of scale that come into their own here .
anyone you talk to will convince you that their system stand out .
in each case , people and well-intended interest are involved .
i can understand very well that this will meet with resistance .
health is a social value , not a commercial commodity .
however , in some country , this is not the problem .
commissioner , it is not a question of attracting young people .
it is a question of allowing them to train .
we need them more every year , not le .
finally , our health force is more important than ever .
i initiated written declaration 0095/2008 on this issue , which is ongoing .
however , we feel this most acutely in our own back yard .
it is therefore very important to regulate the principle of cross-border medical care .
europe face a number of challenge in sustaining and improving our healthcare service .
we can not allow doctor to be on duty for too long .
i would also like to draw attention to the question of health promotion .
the rest of their doctor are all in the united state of america .
5th world water forum in istanbul , 16-22 march 2009 ( debate )
water shortage have spread beyond the traditionally arid area .
the scandal is that the first victim are always the poorest .
we are fighting for access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all .
public intervention is indeed able to resolve this problem of access .
this goal can be achieved only if we all contribute to it .
it ha also improved water governance and management in acp country .
member state are invited to participate with additional funding .
three year have passed since that statement and what ha happened ?
i have here with me a unicef brochure which date from 2001 .
'that access to water ha an enormous influence on development ' ;
we need to reach a real turning point on the water issue .
appropriate finance will then , of course , be required .
these are practical matter , but they also have enormous moral importance .
this mean that one child dy every 15 second .
this lead to armed conflict , migration and destabilisation .
in other word , it hinders development and increase developmental inequality .
politician will also be present at the forum we are debating .
take the example of water a a fundamental human right .
a right can not be bought or sold in a free society .
a right is only bought in a society of slave .
a special role and special task in this area await local authority .
in recent year , regulation in this field ha been significantly extended .
all that is fundamentally important for this water forum .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 march 2009 .
firstly , the budget for healthcare must be increased .
secondly , better and efficient use should be made of budgetary support .
fourthly , the healthcare sector must be better coordinated .
it might not be the health sector but education or water and sanitation .
however , commissioner , i want to come back to the people .
child mortality in swaziland wa 78/1000 in 1997 , compared to 86/1000 now .
the figure regularly published at international level constantly confirm this .
it is the issue of health condition for the tuareg people in niger .
i am putting this request again today to the commission .
implementation of the single euro payment area ( sepa ) ( debate )
we now realise that these question were probably justified .
we think it is undoubtedly time to do so .
this is precisely the difficulty we have with this issue of interchange fee .
furthermore , the sepa direct debit will only be launched later this year .
however , for many member state this remains a very sensitive question .
this guidance should be provided by november 2009 at the latest .
in the commission 's opinion , this should not happen .
here , clear communication by bank will be important .
this situation will have benefit both for the banking sector and for consumer .
it is legitimate to cover cost and keep a profit margin for participant .
on the other hand , opacity or arbitrariness should be avoided .
obviously , we hope that they will be taken into consideration .
i believe that the required degree of transparency is not present here .
it is precisely during a crisis that we need commensurate support for business .
i think that the sepa would be a good instrument here .
let me , however , recall three important point .
we will relentlessly continue our effort a a sepa catalyst .
the vote will take place tomorrow , 12 march 2009 .
we have had another example of this today with these testimony .
the european union appears to have the ability to help in resolving conflict .
there can not be any impunity for such crime .
an inclusive dialogue is required , leading to a political settlement .
then i turn my attention to amendment 3 , 4 and 5 .
i doubt that anyone would suggest that this is fabricated .
i do not believe that he would be fabricating .
again , i suggest they are genuine and not fabricated .
everybody round the chamber would support the work of the humanitarian organisation .
i therefore genuinely call upon you , please , to act wisely .
can we allow ourselves to leave people to be evacuated ?
therefore , they want to return to their land .
i know how the people long for peace after 25 year of violence .
the game is up ; they can not carry on like this .
it is the fundamentalism on both side that is demanding so many victim .
without a compromise on a peaceful solution , the future look gruesomely violent .
we have to revert back to peace mediation without winner or loser .
( de ) mr president , thank you commissioner for speaking so plainly .
mr president , this is not a point of order .
i want to thank mr meijer for his remark .
lady and gentleman , i strictly applied the rule of procedure .
in any case , this process unfortunately broke down .
it wa once a paradise and could become a paradise again .
the vote will take place tomorrow , 12 march 2009 .
( the sitting wa closed at 11.35 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9 a.m . )
the eastern partnership is a key tool to accomplish that .
nevertheless , i welcome the recent thaw in relation .
we are lagging behind the u . that is terrible .
however , it is absolutely vital that we make this clear to ukraine .
the same applies to georgia and to all other country .
we know that both of these seem distant goal at the moment .
i would like to emphasize that this cooperation must also convey value .
i would appeal for caution in the case of belarus .
this country 's current promise that it will achieve democracy remain groundless .
young people who support the opposition are being conscripted into the army .
if that happens , remember not to grumble about moscow 's policy .
we have the necessary instrument available to u today .
that is key for the stability and security of the european union .
in this multilateral dimension i see the value added of this new project .
i hope it will be approved in march by the euroepan council .
energy security , a wa said , is a key issue .
there were question during the debate on whether to have third country involved .
the visit took place and not a word on democratic value wa uttered .
there should be no carte blanche for the lukashenko regime .
mr president , the eastern partnership is a project which cover six country .
belarus ha little in common with , say , georgia .
could the eastern partnership stand in for a black sea strategy ?
in other word , we are dealing with a common neighbourhood .
russia look to that neighbourhood a being it reserved sphere of interest .
this make that neighbourhood an area of conflicting interest and rivalry .
otherwise we will not achieve security and stability there , but the opposite .
the eastern partnership should not be limited to cooperation between government .
what then , is , left for the black sea synergy to achieve ?
each of these country is faced with a choice .
they can follow either the russian or the european model .
instead , it is an agreement which will clearly benefit both side .
the community will guarantee greater energy and political security for itself .
we know perfectly well the effect of this membership on russia .
we are looking for stability and energy security from this eastern partnership .
the problem showed itself in fact when the new country gained accession .
mr president , catch-the-eye is a good opportunity for polemic .
he would admit a droit de regard in zone of influence for russia .
let me say at the outset that it is based on value .
it give support for both political and economic reform .
a lot can be said about this eastern partnership .
it is a young policy and one ha to give it a chance .
we can not implement a strategy in just one year .
i am very grateful to mr saryusz-wolski for his support .
the eastern partnership is a project for many year .
this effort can bring tangible political and economic benefit .
eu-brazil strategic partnership - mexico strategic partnership ( debate )
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
the strategic partnership must be substantial in scope and of a gradual nature .
brazil is also a country of decisive importance to mercosur .
action also need to be taken to protect and manage water resource .
migration is one basic issue on the european political agenda .
honourable member , what doe the strategic partnership mean for u ?
we would like to complete the negotiation on two major aspect .
finally , let me mention the role of the european parliament .
this new scenario lead u to intensify and diversify our relation .
the strategic partnership should be accompanied by regular yearly summit .
i hope such a summit may be held with mexico this year .
bilaterally , there is ample potential for the relation to grow .
however , this strategic partnership can not avoid certain immovable point .
there are other risk , however , which we must not forget .
firstly , it recommends putting an end to economic protectionism in brazil .
that , despite the positive point , lead u to abstain .
firstly , we believe that the report ignores negative consequence in economic term .
in itself , this doe not trouble me much .
firstly , europe can not declare every country a strategic partner .
the question of tangible result is frequently left unanswered .
the subject of market access is a salient issue for both camp .
with this point , i shall wind up my speech .
more ambition is needed , both for europe and for latin america .
we have to set a target : for example , 2025 .
malinche needed no visa to go and teach quechua or mayan to cortés .
it promotes free competition in the area of air service .
this is key to communication ; this is key to doing business .
it is good that we are also concluding bilateral agreement .
mexico will also be affected by the dramatic fall in oil price .
mexico wa considered a shining example to be followed .
naturally , it is a political decision based on certain criterion .
these include particularly the question of climate change and the financial crisis .
i think it is very important to carry on with these special dialogue .
i hope it will happen in the latter part of the year .
i think that the lula government ha taken important step in this direction .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
i feel that the eu-brazil strategic partnership is beneficial for both side .
this memorandum ha been published and contains their demand .
there are two conflicting position : one of the party is lying .
the eu can be decisive in the search for the truth .
i therefore ask myself : what is our task a the european union ?
we need somehow to bring about the resumption of the sino-tibetan dialogue .
however , it must take place on a different basis .
we are being called on at home to enter into dialogue .
the eu policy vis-à-vis china is one of engagement .
in your resolution you stipulate the future of a sino-tibetan dialogue .
i am thinking of a paragraph on culture , education and religion .
i think this is important in order to bring this dialogue further .
let me conclude by sharing with you a personal conviction .
it is a principle that ha served u well .
ever since then , tibet ha been under the control of beijing .
in doing this , we do not seek to provoke or antagonise china .
nevertheless , the socialist group wa opposed to this debate and resolution .
why is it necessary to revisit the issue again ?
the problem is it is beginning to be resented elsewhere within china .
madam president , i have been following the case of tibet for year .
what make it great is the magnanimity of it act and it generosity .
a year ago , the violence escalated once again .
what is the response to this show of power ?
the dalai lama ha urged his people to maintain the path of non-violence .
his call for dialogue ha had no positive response in beijing .
he said , 'we must build a great wall against separatism ' .
two day ago , the european parliament displayed flag .
there were peaceful protest in all part of the eu .
the memorandum must form the basis for further negotiation .
we must have an answer to 600 imprisoned tibetan .
this is a request that parliament should be proud to support .
in the run-up to the game , china gave foreign journalist some space .
all the medium have to submit to the censorship diktats of the party .
what is more , the government also block website .
internet user inform one another quickly of political development a they happen .
i saw then how much the inhabitant of tibet need help .
we do not want dialogue , we want negotiation .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
in fact , quite the opposite is the case .
china ha not been singled out in any way .
this is because we believe that it is the right approach to take .
better career and more mobility : a european partnership for researcher (
employee participation in company with a european statute ( vote )
former yugoslav republic of macedonia : progress report 2008 ( vote )
this is mentioned in order to distinguish it from the serbian orthodox group .
for all final translation i propose using the original english version .
the mandate of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (
- before the vote on paragraph 1 ( h ) :
5th world water forum in istanbul , 16-22 march 2009 ( vote )
mr president , the zaragoza 2008 international expo closed on 14 september 2008 .
hence we propose the following recital , which i shall read in english :
ec development assistance to health service in sub-saharan africa ( vote )
implementation of the single euro payment area ( sepa ) ( vote )
i also request roll-call voting for the final vote .
( for the outcome and other detail of the vote : see minute )
therefore , i welcome the outcome of this vote .
croatia should be allowed to accede when it is completely ready .
at this moment in time , that is absolutely not the case .
we can resolve dispute by listening carefully to all of the party involved .
this is why the parliament of both country should ratify that outcome beforehand .
just imagine how it will comply with european regulation .
indeed , turkey paid for monument to be erected for these terrorist .
this is modern turkey , governed by a fundamentalist , islamist party .
now , in reality , that is not the problem .
that is true , but that is a foreign policy matter .
the fact that we need strategic partnership is not a criterion for accession .
however , i do have some concern about turkey 's progress towards membership .
we need an eu which is wider and not deeper .
in spite of this , accession negotiation have not yet begun .
coexistence between national and ethnic community ha also been well organised .
the naming of the country must not be an obstacle !
bilateral talk about the name can be held simultaneously .
mr president , i wa very pleased with the vote today .
i hope that the greek member will see the sense of this .
sri lanka deserves to live in peace , a we in europe do .
but after that we have to allow the army to continue their campaign .
we penalise our producer where they do not meet those standard .
mr president , italy is suffering a real brain drain .
four priority area were identified where progress is essential namely
that is why we abstained from voting on the report .
mr president , doe an academic career depend on mobility ?
the next stage involves higher education and graduate and doctoral study .
it is essential to make the selection and promotion process open and transparent .
video game for minor are associated with many disturbing cultural and social problem .
lecture from eu institution have almost the opposite effect .
for these reason , i voted against this report in the final vote .
it is therefore our duty to protect consumer , especially child .
the video game market is a fast-growing global market .
child imitate the game which can lead to tragic result .
therefore , with this reservation , i have voted for the report .
i believe that playing video game is very important for educational reason .
last tuesday wa a fairly typical day at the gaza crossing .
despite claim to the contrary , this is not simply a technical report .
i regard it a wholly inappropriate for parliament to approve this agreement .
in writing . - i welcome today 's resolution on sri lanka .
what purpose doe it serve in finding a long-term solution ?
civilian are constantly being killed or wounded in attack by this army .
hundred of thousand are confined and many have no access to humanitarian aid .
the agricultural land of southern europe are cry out in warning .
soil deterioration is a problem which can not be ignored .
this prof that immigration is a human drama which creates inhuman situation .
the problem of immigration will not be solved like this .
these result must be constantly reinforced through the adoption and implementation of reform .
and we must not consider only croatia in this resolution .
the report unfortunately comprises both serious lack and misdirected demand .
this is important for the many european of turkish origin .
mr oomen-ruijten 's report is much too weak in this regard .
we sincerely believe that the eu ha a tremendous potential to effect change .
under no circumstance can these be dealt with superficially or lightly .
i welcome the clear majority in favour of the resolution on turkey .
religious minority continue to be discriminated against and harassed .
justice must be applied in the same way for everyone .
support is needed , mainly to increase regional decision making and cooperation .
i voted against this resolution in the final vote .
the provision of water must be , and remain , in public hand .
yet even in developed country we are seeing serious water shortage .
half the population of sub-saharan africa is still living in poverty .
indeed , this must include access to sexual and reproductive health service .
there is nothing more human and , at the same time , european .
we in the june list are opposed to this .
this fee is uncompetitive and raise cost for consumer .
this relationship will help to build other bridge with latin america .
the doubling in murder related to drug violence is a worrying situation .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i would like to speak on the subject of china .
we did intend to move it in the march ii session .
it is clear that this is not the answer .
this is therefore also essential for our own european security .
at the same time , a cocaine-smuggling route pass through the country .
i would like also to send condolence to their family .
the presence of drug-dealers and so much crime are more than worrying today .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
they were constructed from the top down and by outside influence .
those guilty of murder and abduction are neither tracked down nor punished .
foreign attempt at mediation have been repudiated and eventually ended .
it is therefore important to understand the multiplicity of response .
secondly , however , there is also a need for a political response .
according to the government in manila , abu sayyaf is collaborating with al-qaida .
peace talk were suspended in august of last year .
we support all action which intends to achieve a fair and lasting peace .
most unsettling is that the majority of the perpetrator remain at large .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
author . - madam president , the situation in darfur is desperate .
can you imagine the human suffering behind the united nation statistic ?
the aid agency in darfur run the largest humanitarian operation in the world .
the government ha now taken an interest in this conflict .
in practice , that is not a solution that can be implemented .
i fully support the international criminal court 's decision .
madam president , commissioner , we find ourselves in a very complicated situation .
the instigator is the sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir .
we will need to react to such a move .
we must not therefore give in to this blackmail .
i would , however , like to put a question to the commissioner .
we are aware of the african union 's position on the al-bashir case .
author . - madam president , i have two oral amendment .
one is on recital b and the other is on paragraph 4 .
concerning paragraph 4 the amendment is in two part .
they are small thing so that we better understand and everybody can agree .
mr roure , it is the word 'yesterday ' .
- ( fr ) madam president , i agree .
so we are calling for the deletion of paragraph 2 and 6 .
( de ) madam president , i have a request .

( el ) mr president , the next few day will mark :
they have mobilised considerable army and police force to deal with demonstrator .
mr president , intergroups have a long and distinguished history in this parliament .
twenty-three of the twenty-seven member state supported hungary against the commission .
in this way we will have proof of their usefulness .
this is happening in 2009 in two neighbouring eu member state .
we know the risk that these ship bring in area such a this .
he ordered his men to shoot at people helping wounded palestinian .
we must break the silence which exists in this chamber regarding this matter .
no nation is better or worse than any other .
today , the palestinian people need our help and support .
we should rise to the challenge and address this problem .
in germany a young man killed 15 people and then killed himself .
are we doing enough to protect ourselves and our child ?
are we doing enough to protect those who are at risk ?
are we doing enough for peace in our own land ?
the bombing ha stopped , but the blockade continues .
i would like to remind you of this fact .
i need hardly say that neither power plant will be using cc .
it is an attempt to destroy any palestinian presence whatsoever in east jerusalem .
the first public hearing is due to take place on 31 march .
the russian have now deferred these important talk indefinitely .
it wa only the approach that wa wrong in this case .
secondly , there wa a clear lack of communication .
therefore , i would ask the commission to submit a new proposal .
we need a new wave of enlargement : that of europe 's conscience .
we are facing challenge which are unprecedented in european history .
the next item is the joint debate on partnership agreement :
there ha been real tension between trade and development objective .
they did not necessarily aim to get the best development outcome .
the third assurance i want is on the most-favoured-nation ( mfn ) status .
we only have the choice of voting yes or no .
there are two difference with respect to the cariforum agreement .
the final agreement will not be negotiated for some time .
please allow me therefore to name some of the most important point .
doing so would increase the likelihood of a corresponding positive response from parliament .
my final comment refers to the point concerning parliament .
of course , the commission is in a good position .
there wa a lot of criticism regarding the content .
there are serious fear in relation to the negotiation on comprehensive epa .
they reflect certain conflict within the blocked doha development round .
finally , there are also question regarding mode 4 .
let me finally make a brief , personal comment .
the collaboration wa successful and i think we have achieved a great deal .
this is essentially what the interim agreement are all about .
some people claim that these agreement go too far and are too comprehensive .
quite the contrary : trade lead to development , duty lead to poverty .
i wa responsible for the interim agreement with ghana .
trade can provide an excellent contribution in this case .
in this regard , i hope that our negotiation will be fruitful .
so , what is to be said about the situation today ?
on this point , i want particularly to emphasise public procurement .
is the commission prepared to propose similar measure in other region ?
so we have to do that ; that it is the first thing .
only two of the 14 have actually signed up for the interim agreement .
it is in there because i tabled an amendment , which wa accepted .
the epa thus operate in a way which conforms to wto rule .
significant progress is now being made in negotiation with various region .
each region ha it own characteristic and is proceeding at it own rate .
this will send an encouraging signal to all acp country .
in addition to these we also took other step .
i inherited this file at an advanced stage of negotiation .
i have heard them and i have listened to them .
epa are , if you like , where trade meet development .
this look and feel to me like the beginning of successful partnership .
we also said we are in a particularly difficult financial situation .
congratulation , and all power to your elbow again .
the text contained in the sadc-epa resolution present a good compromise .
i would very much like your support for this initiative .
we plunder everything there is and take all the rich .
that , therefore , is the reason for our misgiving and our questioning .
what guarantee do we have with regard to this ?
no one can claim that the cotonou system wa entirely satisfactory .
this mean ensuring that company operating in the eu are child-labour-free .
you can also read about the right to establish fund for individual inhabitant .
at this time of global recession , that may not be easy .
the or are at the heart of a 'living basin ' .
guyana even ha one of it main border with suriname .
we have to really work much more towards fulfilling those objective .
that is a recent comment by a new president .
if that is the case , how will you do it ?
this agreement includes all the measure necessary to establish a free trade area .
a regard côte d'ivoire , we would like very clear assurance .
we meet with ngo , we meet with smes .
today , therefore , i think that we must not close our eye .
it is a failure and i think that ha been said already .
allow me to respond to two of the point that have been raised .
the agreement make provision for monitoring and review that will involve parliament .
their implementation will be supported by the aid for trade financial package .
i look forward with personal interest to your vote tomorrow .
in my view this is a key moment in the development of epa .
we all know that it will help the development of these country .
so please just tell me what you want me to do .
he ha been doing all the work with sadc .
we have had very positive contribution from both the council and the commission .
for some of u in this chamber , that is also extremely important .
i wa pleased that she also made commitment on most-favoured-nation status .
let me turn to a separate issue , which is the resolution .
a couple of my conservative epp colleague have made comment about this .
this is an agreement which really fulfils what we are asking for .
that is something we do not want to see .
this wa the case regarding banana and on cotton for other country .
there are other aspect involved which are important for developing country .
i know that sometimes it is against his belief with regard to trade .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
we simply want to ensure that they present no danger .
we also ought to examine them and bring them up to date .
i am very grateful for the excellent cooperation with the czech presidency .
that , too , is not always the case in this chamber .
i would just like to say something about the issue of labelling .
label allow consumer to make free and informed choice .
i should just like to address a few point .
this is something we already have for pharmaceutical product .
mr roth-behrendt ha already spoken on the subject of nanotechnology .
a i said , this regulation is also part of our simplification programme .
there are probably few people around who could really understand it .
transposition of the directive wa causing problem in the 27 member state .
therefore , it is important to be concerned about cosmetic .
we still have much to do in that area .
yet , i find that the critic often tend to stop short .
and we have a directive turned into a regulation .
will they stand up and say , 'we were wrong ' ?
i do not think they will do any of these thing .
she wanted to support clear labelling of product about the content of nanomaterials .
now , it ha clearly stated that we do indeed need specific regulation .
it wa brought onto the market without sufficient explanation of the risk .
the same generally also applies in the field of nanotechnology .
there , too , we need consistency between cosmetic and foodstuff .
the biggest stumbling block in the negotiation with the council wa precisely nanomaterials .
in fact , we still do not know very much about it .
more knowledge and information must be obtained on nanomaterials .
- ( sk ) i would like to thank the rapporteur .
it is a highly important document for protecting consumer health .
these can have both positive and negative effect on human health .
we have taken the first step with this regulation .
the use of nanomaterials ha forced u to address the issue again .
it work on one person , but doe not work on another .
therefore , we should not take the matter quite a seriously .
therefore , i ask you not to prolong this procedure too much .
( da ) mr president , we all use cosmetic product .
there is , of course , no point in scaring consumer .
it wa obvious that the cosmetic directive needed to be redrafted .
claim about nanoparticles and cosmetic product are a good example of this .
real democracy listens to everyone , but reflects the majority view .
no-one ha expressed a wish to take the floor .
there is only one thing left for me to do at this point .
i would like to sincerely thank you for your agreement and support .
we have , indeed , succeeded in banning animal testing .
label have never , at any point , been warning .
all product on the european market have to be safe and harmless .
i have tried to make the process very transparent .
the vote will take place tomorrow , tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the use of biocides ha made a significant contribution to these achievement .
however , why ha this proposal appeared so late ?
important area now have to be urgently harmonised and regulated .
no-one want u to lose our high hygiene standard .
we must keep them in order to meet new challenge .
permit me , however , to offer a reflection .
that would accelerate the development of alternative safer material .
can the commission or the rapporteur give me an answer to that question ?
any carelessness on our part may have irrevocable consequence .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
one year after lisbon : the eu-africa partnership at work ( debate )
the first point is on the role of parliament .
secondly , involvement in drawing up the annual progress report .
flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund .
this is also important from the point of view of demographic trend .
we have common problem , we face common challenge .
africa deserves our support , and not only for that reason .
i will conclude with one more question for the commissioner .
i know that the commissioner is familiar with this famous quotation .
they taught u how to pray with our eye closed .
down there , there is a shortage of everything .
there is a shortage of manager , doctor , teacher and technician .
down there , they do not even manage to feed their population .
we should continue with the effort to involve those country more intimately .
the rapporteur , mr marten , ha clearly stated this fact .
how can we ensure that financial aid from different country is properly distributed ?
this is an issue we discussed a few month ago .
we also spoke about the step china is taking .
a number of doubt emerged back in 2007 , however , regarding funding .
will the fund be found to achieve this joint strategy ?
what is the future for the acp state and the cotonou agreement ?
let u work together to make these institution more democratic .
the council and the commission should make this a key priority .
i also have a comment to make to the rapporteur .
in paragraph 46 she refers to african food security and food sovereignty .
furthermore , these investment do not provide any job .
secondly , i would like to thank the institution involved .
i would like to comment on what mr hutchinson said .
yes , many bad thing are happening in africa .
back then , it would have been business a usual .
however , not much progress wa made in this field last year .
the leading global financial institution are making the following prediction for 2009 .
it will be the first time that this ha happened in 50 year .
there were three fact that brought about this strategy .
three hundred million people live on le than eur 1 a day .
let u take the fight against climate change a an example .
certain country are aiming to draw african country into their sphere of influence .
being on an equal footing foster a greater degree of commitment .
i still remember the struggle for the billion for the food facility .
that wa not easy , but we obtained good condition .
i am therefore , naturally , entirely in agreement .
( fr ) therefore we have no intention of reopening that debate .
moreover , i must say that i am very cautious .
that said , we still need to know what we want .
that profile ha not been used to set the budget for the initiative .
i shall miss out everything to do with china .
we can not criticise them for doing it , but we can wonder .
i am not saying that these are bad contract .
i am simply saying that a whole series of issue merit response .
african country have the right to make partnership agreement with the chinese too .
there is even competition and it is not always useful competition .
i must tell you that there are some really interesting lead .
i will come to parliament with that in april .
i have had the opportunity to do so in three different country .
this is the first debate about the implementation of the strategy .
we have made a start , but we are still at the beginning .
there is still an exceptional amount left to do .
the commissioner ha made the necessary remark in that regard .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
these effort will obviously be made using a combination of multiple instrument .
these programme were presented to and awarded by the member state last december .
the others will be finalised in the next few week .
collectively , these seven programme represent approximately eur 1.8 billion .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
social responsibility of subcontracting undertaking in production chain ( short presentation )
common european problem have to be solved with common rule .
we have already seen how country-specific system also act a preventive force .
it will hold it first meeting on 25 march .
we therefore need to study it economic and legal repercussion in detail .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
allow me to give you a brief progress report on these negotiation .
however , we are still far from an agreement .
the commission eagerly awaits other opportunity for effective cooperation with parliament .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
i want to stress that the fta must help :
achieve growing bilateral benefit for an ever-increasing number of citizen
the eu is india 's biggest foreign investor and trade partner .
we must also ensure that social and environmental agreement and standard are respected .
for the milk and the yoghurt or for the bottle and the tub ?
today , therefore , where ( among other thing ) :
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
food price have seen a very sharp rise recently .
i also support the idea of a european competition network .
artistic study in the european union ( short presentation )
historically , artistic study were linked to education during the earlier year .
this issue is occupying an increasingly important place at european level .
artistic education is a vector of well-being , creativity and social integration .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
greater and more specific attention must undoubtedly be focused on artistic study .
active dialogue with citizen on europe ( short presentation )
it is important for u now fully to implement this agreement .
the commission appreciates the unfailing support it receives from parliament .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
the european population doe n't feel that they are european citizen .
there are two approach which can not continue to exist in parallel .
gyula hegyi 's report shed light on an important contemporary problem .
we need to know that decision making is in our hand .
one reason is obvious : the union ha a very male face .
at least one woman should be appointed to these .
combating female genital mutilation in the eu ( short presentation )
we do not want palliative proposal such a 'pricking ' .
we are obviously in full agreement with the report .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
genital mutilation is a social problem that concern u all .
multilingualism : an asset for europe and a shared commitment ( short presentation )
i also highlight the importance of language a a factor of social inclusion .
i indicate the need for policy supporting translation , both literary and technical .
i do not feel that this alternative should be accepted .
i therefore urge this house to be very careful .
i welcome the general support parliament ha given to our approach to multilingualism .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 march 2009 .
it can help achieve unity effectively in a world of diversity .
in writing . - ( de ) linguistic diversity is important .
( the sitting wa closed at 11.05 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9 a.m . )
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
no other part of the world ha generated so much mutual cohesion .
it also add a third component , namely that of territorial cohesion .
we deal with these matter in this green paper .
that is not the europe that this parliament expects .
territorial cohesion also complement the existing policy of economic and social cohesion .
all our citizen need a policy of solidarity and european integration .
the second part of my report concern best practice in cohesion policy .
it is logical that our attention is focused on city .
city generate more than 70 % of europe 's vat .
however , many city are facing a range of serious problem .
i would like to thank everyone who assisted me in drafting this report .
what constitutes a rural area ha yet to be defined with any precision .
i will finish at the end of this debate .
but how should we approach these layer of society ?
for this reason i do not support introducing an interest-rate cap .
your message is also clear on the need to strengthen the urban-rural relationship .
in other word , we need to target the policy at functional area .
good governance practice must be disseminated rapidly across europe .
this may help also to overcome difficulty in implementing cohesion programme .
i share your view that we must continue to reform policy delivery .
it requires action to be taken at all level .
however , there are certain consideration that we want to state .
secondly , they must also be used to bring in private finance .
at it worst , this could even appear counterproductive .
firstly , the existence of geographical and demographic peculiarity in region ;
they enabled a broad consensus to be achieved within our committee .
cohesion is one of the most obvious success of the european project .
my colleague from the alde group will deal with the other item .
yet this is of fundamental significance for the future .
the nuts3 data show up the problem far more clearly .
we should take this into account when allocating funding .
it should mean that everyone is given an equal opportunity .
today we have six very good report before u .
it is a pity that we are discussing them all in one go .
why not , given the climate crisis that we are currently facing ?
the structural fund should be used only to support sustainable project .
the second question concern the implementation of the partnership principle .
local , grass-roots knowledge is an asset for u .
you have not taken the partner ' report into account .
thirdly , so-called territorial cohesion must contribute to economic and social cohesion .
seventhly , land management and planning are the responsibility of each member state .
i thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation and hard work .
i welcome the fact that we are having this debate now .
i believe this must be active through the second pillar of the cap .
first , that territorial cohesion involves promoting polycentric development across the european union .
this mean eliminating disparity within , a well a between , region .
a higher degree of consistency requires transparency in relation to data and payment .
we are saying that we are facing a wall of silence .
we have already come to a consensus on this .
i would like to thank all the rapporteur for their hard work .
regional development within capitalist framework can not remove class conflict in the system ;
we need more project which are supported by several ministry at once .
we must make the european requirement for cross-departmental cooperation binding .
perhaps we should even seriously consider setting a minimum project amount .
this discourages the beneficiary and fuel criticism from the inspection body .
mr van nistelrooij stressed that the cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity .
so then , the benefit can not be denied .
madam president , i wish to speak about urban and city funding .
commissioner , you have visited belfast a number of time .
in truth we moved away from urban without a practical substitute in place .
the discussion on territorial cohesion is fundamentally a debate on integrated action .
the first of these area is long-lasting public eu funding .
the eu budget must include a budget for these micro-credits .
these micro-credits are primarily granted at the local level .
we can not agree with solution and result of this kind .
the green paper ha arrived at last , and we are pleased .
we need the white paper a soon a possible , commissioner .
here , in cohesion policy , we must strive for this harmony .
i would like to single out two of these measure and reinforce them .
this regulation imposes an excessive bureaucratic burden on small project in particular .
it is right that this period should now be reduced to three year .
it is essential that a different process is used in this case .
( bg ) what are the basic objective of the micro-credit initiative ?
the french presidency made an attempt to do so , which i welcome .
territorial cohesion is not meant to focus exclusively on region suffering permanent handicap .
to finish , i would of course like to thank all our rapporteur .
all these issue require a strong , consolidated response from the european union .
i would particularly like to congratulate mr van nistelrooij for his extraordinary effort .
there is also a significant disparity among these area in individual member state .
if we compare rural and urban area , these disproportion are even greater .
romania ha a considerable number of such populated settlement .
we must increase the fund available for these micro-credit support structure .
in ireland some commendable work ha been done in this regard .
the project also includes training for nearly 50 000 people .
this morning , a very important event wa launched in this house .
i only regret that none of them refer to cultural policy .
widespread use of micro-credits is a good instrument for cohesion policy .
finally , let me say that i back mr becsey on his microcredit .
a specific european response to the crisis for the outermost region ...
this is important not only in a time of crisis .
i know there is going to be a battle here .
the risk we run is that the fund will be misused .
you are welcome to continue this dialogue with u in the commission .
i very much appreciate your support for financial engineering .
we are on track , but much more can certainly be done .
culture also play an important economic role in the development of regional development .
we have recognised this in the framework of the european cohesion policy .
this will be presented publicly at the end of april .
the public ha a very ambivalent view of european structural policy .
this is why we must change how thing are done .
this will allow european added value to be created for the european union .
we really must concentrate on the task in hand .
these people are our fellow citizen and our constituent .
we must therefore welcome all attempt to simplify the achievement of this objective .
in my view , mr baco 's vote is more of a misunderstanding .
i am pleased by mr nicholson 's support on this issue .
another point i would like to address is the matter of financing .
i hope that this will begin in the second half of the year .
i consider it important that we continue to encourage people in this regard .
i think this , too , is of great importance .
that is a really good thing , including for everyone here .
we must not fritter that away in the subsequent period .
finally , there must be a white paper on territorial cohesion .
a micro-credit can be accessed by company with fewer than 10 employee .
micro-enterprises account for 91 % of europe 's commercial company .
secondly , the procedure relating to this service must be examined .
that wa a joint failure by all of u .
territorial cohesion play an important role in this respect .
in this context , we should highlight the agricultural industry .
this includes a contribution from the eu of pln 11.4 billion .
structural fund are public fund which are subject to national public procurement legislation .
this legislation must create a simple and effective procedure for selecting contactors .
excessively long tender procedure can delay realisation of structural fund .
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
agreement between the ec and nepal on certain aspect of air service (
the eu priority for the 64th session of the un general assembly (
one year after lisbon : the eu-africa partnership at work (
rapporteur . - mr president , i will be very brief .
the work of the acp-eu joint parliamentary assembly in 2008 (
regional policy best practice and obstacle to use of structural fund (
complementarity and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measure (
structure and rate of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco (
multilingualism : an asset for europe and a shared commitment (
this contradicts everything that this parliament and the other european institution have upheld .
my report doe not attack or harm so-called minority language .
it is our responsibility a meps that is at stake .
there is a request to speak and there may be others .
mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
so this is a point of order concerning clarification .
member are voting on what he asked them to vote .
but , if we did not listen before , we should listen now .
it talk about something very fundamental in the way we disburse our aid .
the european union owes it success to the gradual raising of economic barrier .
china and all of those country will be very powerful .
it is not well coordinated and it ha high administrative cost .
this is an opportunity to democratise access to culture .
art education develops sensitivity and open up creative potential .
mr president , i have always considered all good sport to be art .
this all-ireland team won the six nation - the grand slam .
we need active dialogue between european nation and citizen .
we also need that in this house , in the european parliament .
we should be prepared to listen to different point of view .
the people still look to their national government to save them .
the list of demand should be given serious consideration .
it is time that we genuinely engaged in active dialogue with citizen .
so i do reject the insult of this report .
it ha failed to actively engage and connect with the citizen .
mr president , i voted for this report and i welcome it .
we do not just want to listen to one side of the argument .
they only want to listen to those people who vote 'no ' .
mr president , i fully support recital 5 to this report .
enlargement ha contributed to the linguistic diversity of the eu .
i consider the commission notification in this area to be exceptionally important .
it will lead to the opposite of adaptation and assimilation .
that is the opposite of what is actually required in all european country .
this is a very serious risk that must be addressed .
we must not forget the right of local language .
we heard mr lo curto speak a moment ago .
i do not attack any of the right of minority language speaker .
this is of paramount importance to my country , bulgaria .
in order to achieve territorial cohesion , this is a prerequisite .
member state and the commission are not shouldering their responsibility .
we in this parliament must continue to insist that they do .
i would particularly like to talk about the krehl report .
this wa the package agreed on by the czech presidency and the commission .
at this stage , let me pay tribute to two organisation in particular .
i agree with the proposal of the rapporteur to conclude this agreement .
reliability and timeliness of data should be cornerstone of the amended regulation .
on that basis i felt it appropriate to abstain on this report .
in particular , where is the security council representation for asia ?
on the other hand , like-minded country can unite if they so wish .
i am happy to give my support to it .
i am pleased that these recommendation extensively touch on these concern .
the report say nothing about how that can be reduced in reality .
i repeat that i am opposed to the report on those ground .
furthermore , nowhere doe this report even mention the issue of illegal immigration .
i wish to abstain on the report by mr hutchinson on mdg contract .
giving child a chance in life is an important mdg .
such decision should be taken by the member state themselves .
we have therefore chosen to vote against the report .
the problem is to remain an artist a we grow up . '
with those word pablo picasso described the problem associated with artistic training .
we have therefore voted against the report a a whole .
it is true that artistic subject are taught in school throughout europe .
that body of knowledge is very large , and it is constantly growing .
then we can talk about an active dialogue with the citizen .
i supported mr hegyi 's report on active dialogue with citizen on europe .
the eu wa created for economic reason and that remains obvious .
for this reason i have abstained from voting on this report .
that is the essence of their work : dialogue ending in compromise .
it is therefore hard to speak of dialogue and compromise .
nihil novi : nothing new without the common consent .
what we need is to reach the poorer and le educated citizen .
it would be a great success if this figure reached 80 % .
since the action far more resemble propaganda than dialogue , i oppose them .
since the action far more resemble propaganda than dialogue i oppose them .
this added value must now be recognised and honoured .
let u be honest , what difference have they ever made ?
lack of transparency in decision-making process and co-financing scheme ;
delay in payment , cumbersome centrally managed administration in member state ;
all these aspect are recognised in mr krehl 's report .
we also think that some wording pre-empt the rural population 's own choice .
without this , individual measure are doomed to failure .
this is why i have voted against the roszkowski report .
unfortunately the amendment proposed by the polish side were not accepted .
therefore , i did not endorse mr roth-behrendt 's report .
the other important goal is to increase the safety of cosmetic product .
the regulation also introduces more stringent requirement for detailed product description .
another objective is to increase the safety of cosmetic product .
i generally support the roth-behrendt report and the compromise reached with the council .
now the rule are being tightened up , and that is only right .
that is why this proposal for amendment is appropriate .
either it is health that take precedence or it is the market .
for certain product , it can not be the market .
i regret that certain very sensible amendment were rejected by a narrow margin .
division within the various group were large , including my own .
for these reason i therefore voted against mr becsey 's report .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
the report also put forward various proposal for way of achieving this .
in ireland fgm is viewed a an expression of gender-based violence .
visiting the doctor should be something that is done voluntarily .
we have therefore chosen not to support the alternative resolution .
i welcome cooperation between the member state in this area .
the measure and decision taken in the past must be combined and extended .
i consider the practice to be discriminatory against these woman and girl .
i consider the practice to be discriminatory against these woman and girl .
i believe that enforced medical check-ups constitute a massive invasion of privacy .
visiting the doctor must be something that is done voluntarily .
however , the resolution also call for support for sexual and reproductive health .
for this reason it is exploited by some group in support of abortion .
i am sorry , but i have abstained from voting for this reason .
language is in fact a fundamental factor in social inclusion .
this aspect is also mentioned in mr moura 's report .
i therefore believe that we should have a handful of working language .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report .
we can discover in europe the value which we have in common .
i consider this procedure to be very unfair to the rapporteur .
since this proposal went through there wa no vote on the original report .
that make it responsibility in this all the greater .
a feature of a good multilingual policy would be to protect these language .
the issue of multilingualism is vitally important in the european context .
the europe in which i believe is also the europe of linguistic diversity .
for these reason , i identify with mr graça moura 's original report .
this is not and must not be the nature of our debate .
they are also more creative and have broader horizon .
in writing . - multilingualism is a great asset of the european parliament .
i definitely support the multilingualism of the european union .
i firmly believe that europe 's linguistic diversity represents a major cultural asset .
it ha an enormous impact on the life of european citizen .
integration of territorial cohesion in the future development of all community policy ;
development of a comprehensive european strategy for region with specific geographical feature ;
the eu 's cohesion policy is badly thought out .
naturally , the june list voted against the report a a whole .
land management and planning are the responsibility of each member state ;
measure must be adopted to cancel out the so-called statistical effect ;
this is one of our objective , which must be clearly pursued .
i live in poznań , the regional capital of wielkopolska .
urban development ha nothing to do with local centralism .
some of these task involve close collaboration with local government at other level .
urban cohesion is essential in delivering sustainable economic and social progress .
the eu institution and member state should do more to support such scheme .
welcome , prime minister , to the european parliament .
prime minister , we strongly welcome your determination to play such a role .
they talked of a hard , long and bitter cold war .
there is only one europe , and it is our home europe .
we are uniquely placed because of what we have achieved in our union .
i want to thank the member of this european parliament .
you should be proud that this is an achievement of the european union .
yes , we can see unity advanced by official meeting official across frontier .
yes , we see unity when leader meet leader .
today , a you know , an international hurricane is sweeping the world .
we will do all that we can to be on your side .
ten and a half million child is not just a statistic .
how do we build this global consensus for the global change we need ?
seldom ha such cooperation been so obviously of benefit to the whole world .
the people of europe need not be mastered by event .
no matter what they are , we can be master of them .
this is more than a moment of change in our common history .
the initiative for a global response to a global crisis came from europe .
europe ha , therefore , a particular responsibility in the current g20 process .
europe will be united in london and with a unified message .
only in this way will confidence be restored , and confidence is key .
we must not give up on doha and must reach an agreement soon .
solidarity and responsibility are europe 's two major principle .
the eur 400 billion european aid programme will help u overcome the crisis .
mr brown , it is not enough to condemn protectionism abroad .
thank you very much for this , mr brown .
it is not greed , individual greed , which wa the decisive factor .
this ha been a permanent feature of human history and will always exist .
you are having difficulty in keeping up with what is happening .
this is indeed the right road to take , prime minister .
the economic crisis will pas , but climate change will remain .
above all we need an effective struggle for a better climate policy .
this struggle will also provide opportunity for creating many new job .
combining these two thing is exactly the right approach .
can it assemble more asset with increased access to crisis fund ?
we need a new and sustainable economy enshrined in a global social contract .
so let britain be a positive partner , cast in the european mould .
you designed five byzantine test that prevented british entry these past 10 year .
so let u look at the credibility of this crusade against tax haven .
we must stop , not regulate , the action of speculative fund .
you spoke of the ecological rehabilitation of the environment .
the european union ha followed others in succumbing to this temptation .
i do not get the impression that we are on such a path .
however , i am convinced that the problem lie elsewhere .
the doctrine applied over the last 20 year ha failed spectacularly .
this speaks volume of the nature of the challenge of our time .
my goodness me , you showed that this afternoon , prime minister .
shame on you , prime minister , for doing that .
the reason why is that we would have voted 'no ' .
you can not continue to build this european union against public opinion .
please let the people of europe decide their destiny .
do not have it done in parliament like this and parliament like westminster .
at today 's valuation , that would be usd 10 billion higher .
the truth is that you have run out of our money .
the country a a whole is now in negative equity .
every british child is born owing around gbp 20 000 .
once again today you try to spread the blame around .
you spoke about an international recession , international crisis .
the issue is not that you are not apologising .
like it or like it not , the world is changing incredibly fast .
more manufacturing is being done in asia than in europe .
statement are being made that would have been unimaginable a year ago .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
the new decision is to be taken by 6 november this year .
it is , nevertheless , a good end result .
the european investment bank mainly got what it wanted .
i am sure this will be a good decision for all concerned .
people can come in here and speak at all sort of great length .
member of parliament introducing report on behalf of parliament are shortened without notice .
both the eu and china would benefit from increased trade .
the recent eu-china follow-up summit is a welcome sign of hope .
we got into a mess because we were not focusing on the issue .
i think this will be a very useful development .
what we need is more transparency and more accountability .
i also want to congratulate mr mitchell and thank him for his report .
we are asking both bank to make a huge effort .
the first question , sticking to keywords only , is that of duplication .
i am cautious with regard to this question of turning outward and inward .
mr mitchell 's report ha two area of emphasis .
therefore , i would like to thank mr mitchell for his good work .
the bank have a very good rating , better than triple-a .
this enables them to obtain and provide financing on relatively favourable term .
this is especially important in the current financial and economic crisis .
these project require large amount of machinery and are highly capital-intensive .
we need a sustainable socio-environmental policy for both our citizen and the environment .
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial trick .
it seems that now everyone know what the european investment bank must do .
your answer to me have been very evasive , which i find regrettable .
in the present difficult time , this constitutes invaluable support for entrepreneur .
it is timely and welcome in particular for three reason .
should we go further towards a formal system of banking supervision ?
mr bullmann pointed out that thing were perhaps not that simple .
i say again that we are open to such initiative .
a word in conclusion on cooperation between our two institution .
a word in conclusion on mr seppänen 's report .
we are taking our eye off the ball again .
i have raised this issue on a number of occasion .
the vote will take place on wednesday 25 march 2009 .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
the result also show how efficient management and administration are .
let u take the structural and cohesion policy a an example .
abb and abm put the emphasis on and promote efficiency .
with a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility .
management ha a face , at both the lower and the upper level .
there is no need for inessential report and planning .
there have been clear example of this virtually every five year .
for example , we will not achieve our objective in research and innovation .
the common foreign and security policy is also chronically under-funded .
we are only prepared to negotiate about how we achieve our objective .
taking that into account , i would like to thank parliament personally .
the commission ha agreed to present an evaluation of this area .
our credibility and our ability to be an effective partner depend on this .
this relates both to the european development fund and the athena mechanism .
the 300 or more contribution are worth following up .
they are committed proposal which will help u to move forward .
to make it entirely clear , i come from a neutral country .
therefore these consideration must be taken into account in future .
we are the only political level which ha a zero budget .
it is very important that we put these foundation in place .
furthermore , we have just had a debate on the european investment bank .
there are new global challenge present with a significant territorial impact .
these are the rule that we have agreed with one another .
we already have the current screening report - thank you .
we will study it and become familiar with it .
two amendment have been tabled which our group can not accept .
so we have got to be careful about that .
on the other hand , there should be no more long-term subsidy .
it is right for there to be a ban on eu public indebtedness .
this is an excellent policy and must be retained .
the same applies to the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework .
i cordially congratulate mr böge and mr virrankoski on their very good report .
mr grybauskaitė , i wish you the greatest success in the coming election .
all three institution must find the political courage to do this together .
at some point we must put a stop to this .
i would like to mention three point very briefly .
at the same time , the report fails to propose any cost-cutting measure .
this is not budgetary efficiency ; it is quite simply an accounting trick .
we can not allow ourselves any more failed financial perspective in the future .
no , we can not carry on doing thing this way .
firstly , our aspiration for the budget review itself .
currently , all of these area are significantly under-funded .
thirdly , we need to make a number of necessary technical change .
it would be a failure for all of u .
it is not our current parliament that will carry it out .
where do we set the limit , the measure of our ambition ?
we shall have to address two important difficulty in this major negotiation :
secondly , the question of flexibility is very , very important .
flexibility alone is not the solution to the problem .
i wish you all the best during the next few week .
the vote will take place on wednesday 25 march 2009 .
the crisis is not restricted to the european market .
throughout the world the car industry is under pressure .
there is no prospect of improvement in the remaining month of this year .
a you know , the commission ha responded quickly to this situation .
in the case of structural overcapacity , this is a worldwide phenomenon .
on the political side , the commission ha made it position clear .
we have made good progress with the measure that we have taken .
we can also do something on the demand side .
a number of member state have introduced scrappage incentive to stimulate demand .
the process will be painful , but it is inevitable .
more than 200 000 job throughout europe are dependent on the company .
there can only be a transatlantic solution which involves the parent company .
the time for talking about the severity of the crisis ha passed .
it is now time to act and to implement these plan in full .
we have drawn up a joint resolution which cover the most important point .
i would like to repeat some of what you have said .
on this basis we can adopt the joint resolution .
these mean of transport must become le polluting and more energy efficient .
the european automotive industry is the sector 's world leader in technological term .
it is strategic for the whole of europe 's industrial fabric .
million of job depend on it directly and indirectly .
the socialist group in the european parliament want to protect job .
in this respect , i completely agree with mr verheugen 's remark .
this crisis ha hit one of our key industry very hard .
however , the eib need to be better equipped .
i would like to look more closely at general motor .
therefore , we should avoid taking shareholding in the car industry .
i would like to thank the commissioner for taking such active measure .
the key word for european business must be cutting-edge research and development .
it is not doing the same with the economic crisis .
can we extend the scope of the european fund without increasing them ?
my group ha tabled amendment on all of these point .
however , scrappage scheme can resolve the crisis only in the short-term .
this also applies to our neighbour , slovakia , and many other country .
we always visualise the very large company and have little sympathy for them .
we have a large general motor manufacturing site in vienna .
today , unfortunately , the fact prove u right .
in that respect , it is hopefully a problem that will pas .
we need to support those people engaged in the car industry .
it is indeed time for sustainable and robust action .
hence this call , commissioner verheugen , to you and to the commission .
commissioner verheugen , it is not too late for action .
please , let u not allow the situation to go to the dog .
the 27 finance minister should make a joint effort .
i will fight for the future of their job .
in specific term , it result in thousand of worker becoming unemployed .
the most important of these have already been mentioned .
i am asking the czech presidency to begin negotiation on this matter .
this kind of industry will simply not tolerate protectionism on a national level .
i expect community policy to take account of that .
company are not able to obtain the loan that they need .
the european investment bank is now our all-purpose tool .
what about finance for our highly ambitious climate-protection objective ?
all of this is being provided by the eib .
i very much share mr groote 's opinion on co2-based vehicle tax .
i find out more from him than he doe from me .
however , i hope to be able to return the favour in future .
therefore , i believe that we have met all the requirement .
in the 'catch-the-eye ' procedure there were several reference to scrappage incentive .
in this respect , i believe that it ha fulfilled it purpose .
the incentive have also had a positive cross-border impact .
i can promise you that we will do so .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 25 march 2009 ) .
the primary responsibility for handling the crisis rest on the industry itself .
ensuring the competitiveness of the single market is most important for u .
therefore we welcome decision which aim to establish pan-european framework of action .
the first of these is the functional airspace block system coordinator .
the new specification issued by easa must integrate with the existing one .
she wanted a real single sky for the benefit of european citizen .
today we have been able to realise this reform .
the main contribution of the committee on industry relate to financing .
the european sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centre .
when the amount of traffic double , the safety risk increase fourfold .
this led u in 2004 to initiate the single european sky concept .
it is a real step forward , which many of u welcome .
i believe that we can now make significant progress in this area .
the council ha opposed this right until the end .
to conclude , i also welcome the objective of optimising airport management .
we should also continue to focus on important issue from the past .
it provides a few people with employment in the security check at airport .
we are waiting impatiently for the regulation to be abolished .
these two report represent the right way of achieving this .
it is essential that flight in europe should be better coordinated .
i agree , and that is the purpose of our work .
it profit are set to drop by 12 % .
we have raised the problem during several meeting with the competent transport minister .
to conclude , i am grateful to you once again .
i thank you once again for your great commitment .
rapporteur . - ( ro ) just some brief reply .
commissioner , i would like to congratulate you on this success .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 25 march 2009 ) .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.00 and resumed at 21.00 )
the technical reason for this difference : there is none .
even different model from the same manufacturer do not use a standardised charger .
mobile phone could overheat or even explode during the charging process .
i am confident that the industry will act quickly .
we should under no circumstance exclude the possibility of introducing legal regulation .
this is good , but it doe not go far enough .
this is a good thing in an economic crisis .
of course , this is not a easy a it seems .
it will be straightforward to establish a technical standard for this .
i think that we need above all a common technical standard .
i therefore think that this is an excellent solution .
you have succeeded in that , and you have my congratulation .
usb 2 port can transfer not only energy but also data .
the standard you are asking about is in fact already in existence .
my final remark is directed once again at mr rübig .
i think this is a subject which could be taken much further .
common consular instruction : biometric identifier and visa application ( debate )
i have been negotiating with the council for quite a long time .
on fingerprinting the commission proposed to start fingerprinting child at six year old .
thirdly , the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up .
unfortunately there wa not a majority in favour of this in the house .
she is one of the few rapporteur for whom nothing is impossible .
you know that my group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics .
we also oppose the charging of an additional service fee .
therefore , we can not support parliament 's position at second reading .
the regulation on outsourcing also cause me some concern .
a further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing .
i believe it is wrong to pas this charge on to the applicant .
since 1997 , about 6 million migrant have entered the uk .
this is equivalent to a new city the size of birmingham .
most of these migrant enter legally , because they are eu citizen .
in addition to that , we probably have one million illegal immigrant .
what we do not need is a system devised by the european union .
look at another example of eu legislation championed by the liberal democrat .
we have surrendered the right to protect our own citizen .
all this wa voted for and welcomed by the liberal democrat .
firstly , i disagree with the use of external service provider .
secondly , there should have been better data protection .
this will particularly apply in the case of family with several member .
in my country we have had very positive experience in this respect .
for this reason , i am supporting this more citizen-friendly approach .
it will also result in an overall improvement in the eu 's image .
i respect the position of m kaufmann and m ždanoka .
i think that wa part of the ukip election campaign .
i thank all the other speaker who made constructive contribution .
i must also mention the cooperation with the czech presidency .
that wa never really made clear in the commission proposal .
it therefore need to come within the scope of the regulation .
i fully agree that it is essential to uphold the precautionary principle .
however , i do not consider the draft report to be very satisfactory .
we also believe that any regulation should be proportionate and practical .
would not some existing product also be banned under such an edict ?
this is an extremely important issue and it importance is growing .
we need a definition of nanomaterials and clear labelling .
we have traceability on paper , so it will be possible .
we should make this very clear in this regulation .
my final point is that animal should not be subjected to unnecessary suffering .
therefore i recommend that my group vote in favour of the amendment .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
nevertheless food must be included in this regulation , because otherwise ...
to avoid misunderstanding , this report doe not address genetically modified food .
a major consideration is the strict regulatory system of labelling .
there is also a significant debate concerning cloned animal .
it would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in a separate regulation .
we need to make this absolutely clear to consumer .
after all , cloning cause great distress to animal .
why do we distrust peer-reviewed science to such an extent ?
the same question can be asked of national parliament .
we must base legislation on thorough , serious science and accept that .
if not , our credibility a legislator is in question .
there were some critical comment too , of course .
substance that deplete the ozone layer ( recast ) ( debate )
i would like to briefly mention nine important result of that agreement .
this also applies to the gassing of container to control vermin .
fourthly , hcfc may only be used in government-designated business .
the european commission ha undertaken to investigate these substance further .
all in all , we have achieved a satisfactory result .
it thus became necessary to amend the weak point in the treaty .
it will not cut global emission and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness .
i thank mr blokland for his labour-intensive and relevant report .
that is fine , mr doyle , please do so .
these substance , we must remind ourselves , also have a global-warming potential .
mr doyle , you were a good a your word .
in that way we will be obtaining precise information about this substance .
our mutual cooperation ha been excellent , in committee and in the negotiation .
i have one more comment to make , in conclusion .
i am not very happy with the recasting system .
recasting remains a difficult issue for the work of this parliament .
our health is maintained through a clean environment and the atmosphere around u .
( the sitting wa closed at 11 p.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9.10 a.m . )
conclusion of the european council ( 19-20 march 2009 ) ( debate )
i will quote one figure : eur 400 billion .
it is not enough simply to pour money into the system .
we tried that and the bank are still not lending .
the liquidity that is available to them ha not solved the problem .
market are nervous , reacting immediately , excessively and negatively to every signal .
the plan is allegedly deficient , slow and unambitious .
we made significant progress both in energy security and climate protection .
it is more than clear that we need this .
we are trying to find a joint position at the european level .
i would like to pre-empt question about the participation of belarus .
people must be re-installed at the heart of the global economy .
it point out that we are in favour of a social market economy .
however , the european council also looked beyond the crisis .
it ha put the brake on investment in renewable energy .
it ha also put research on clean technology on hold .
therefore , we need to have a clear european response .
we also need to continue to deepen the work of coordination .
we also have the instrument of the lisbon strategy that remain in force .
the same spirit should inspire u a we prepare for the employment summit .
unemployment is rising and most likely will go on rising .
worker all over europe must know that european leader care .
we have invited the social partner to come to the commission .
you have a wealth of knowledge about action on the ground .
but it wa in no sense the end of a process .
we need to keep up the momentum of the process .
lady and gentleman , we do not need any more socialist economic measure .
we need more job , and this package of measure will allow this .
climate change will not wait for the end of the crisis .
what gordon brown said yesterday wa the opposite of what you said here .
that is what you said here a few moment ago .
that is the big mistake that you are making here .
the president of the commission said something very important today .
we must still be able to demand a minimum of institutional respect .
the long term and the short term : both must be addressed .
our leader must be clear about that at the g20 summit .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
see to it that domestic difficulty do not sap your stride .
mr topolánek and his entire cabinet have proved that it is possible .
however , because we are among friend , we must speak sincerely .
i will start with support for the eastern partnership .
it seems to me that absolutely nothing ha been decided .
at the summit eur 5 billion wa also allocated to the anti-crisis package .
therefore i propose extending the time frame of availability for these fund .
the participant of that summit unanimously opposed economic protectionism .
i appeal to mr topolánek to put an end to this .
what are the four element of trust which roosevelt won ?
this is exactly what we have to do at the g20 in london .
the war we have to win today is the war against the planet .
second , we have to bring the city of europe into the game .
i would like to comment again on the eastern partnership .
the conclusion of the summit in this regard are very vague .
he said that the economy of europe are too different for the euro .
i also welcome the postponement of a decision over financing climate move .
all concern about the irresponsibility of the czech republic are therefore completely unnecessary .
i will not be responding to the comment of party leader mr schulz .
i think it is not necessary to respond to some attack .
we proposed a full format to the european council , of course .
it wa not our decision that this summit would be a troika .
i think that 17 day would give u enough time for the debate .
further discussion related to question about regulation versus stimulus measure .
in my opinion this is the only option for tackling the situation .
we are under time pressure to limit any possible future problem .
there wa also discussion about the role of the imf .
i think it would be good to say something about the eastern partnership .
it mark a significant step towards stabilising the situation .
i wa recently in azerbaijan where i spoke with president aliyev .
the eu must remain a sort of lighthouse for these country .
in conclusion i would like to say something about social impact .
we did not talk about how much money we would give to people .
i would like to say in conclusion something about the eu-us summit .
i would finally like to say something about the remark of mr bobošíková .
the czech administration is managing the situation very well so far .
- thank you mr president-in-office of the european council .
with these good wish we thank you for your presence here this morning .
he ignored the enormous debt burden he ha placed on the british people .
i am sorry , but i have not seen any concrete measure .
yes , eur 5 billion , but what is that ?
that is 0.04 % of this union 's gross national product .
please , we can not do it in this way .
we are on your side and will support you in getting that .
this unemployment crisis will not disappear because we refuse to have more meeting .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
supervisory legislation must be amended and precaution for crisis management improved .
the european union must hold fast to it principle .
mr brown ha not a shred of credibility now .
he say that the path taken by the u ha been historically discredited .
the european union must take a lead in that regard .
where is the eu 's leadership when it come to tangible funding ?
that is not the leadership that is needed in the run-up to copenhagen .
however , i do not want to focus on czech domestic politics .
the economic and financial crisis ha of course already been mentioned .
in conclusion i would like to comment once again on the lisbon treaty .
people 's life do not wait , we have to take decision today .
however , we must not depart from our guiding principle of solidarity .
we should be especially sensitive to the problem of new member state .
my honourable friend wa right ; we are living on credit .
we are not managing the economy in a sustainable manner .
unfortunately , the european council is not currently mustering up that much courage .
we are all sinner - some more than others .
this will require proactive intervention by member state government .
free-market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by worker .
obsessive deregulation and privatisation of public service will equally end in tear .
it is a charter for the policy of failure .
we need a new treaty for a new time .
they resemble a victory statement of routed army everywhere .
however , we are not dealing with any of that today .
this aim can not be achieved without ratifying the lisbon treaty .
you can participate in the g20 summit and represent europe at the summit .
a mr merkel ha said , what matter is implementation .
it is increased unemployment and the wider gap that it entail .
absolutely no strategy for dealing with rising unemployment wa established at that summit .
they say that they have already done what need to be done .
i would like to say something briefly about automatic stabiliser .
thus , it is not quite so wonderful any more .
finally , i would like to say a few word about mobility .
mobility is important within the eu and so is the fight against protectionism .
then we can also work to promote increased mobility and to combat protectionism .
we have definitely got thing the wrong way round there .
in that regard i am entirely behind the commission 's approach .
i will conclude with a quick word about the treaty of lisbon .
we , parliament , must set out our position clearly .
this sort of investment is furthermore especially suited to our time .
unfortunately , the summit wa unable to convince people of this .
this must also be the outcome of the meeting of the g20 country .
it is worrying that renault is moving it production from slovenia to france .
we must not allow the spectre of protectionism to wreak havoc once again .
history will punish those who fail in their responsibility .
there is every reason to welcome the proposal by the de larosière group .
the european central bank will have an even more important role .
policy must be appropriate even in time of crisis .
this measure will help stabilise country like hungary and latvia .
the conservative here and in member state are like naughty child .
president in-office topolánek chose sweden a a comparison to america .
let u have an employment summit for all member state on 7 may .
why do i begin with these perhaps unpleasant remark ?
not only ha financial credit contracted but also social credit .
this global crisis is aggravated by a crisis of european integration .
the former are member of the euro area , the latter are not .
the european union can not survive with new demarcation line .
- ( pt ) the summit 's response wa not ambitious enough .
where is the firm commitment to abolish tax haven and offshore financial centre ?
where is the decision to moralise the salary of banking executive ?
this is not the way to restore people 's trust .
lastly , i heard someone say that they do not need socialist proposal .
however , economic depression is not a time for moral depression .
and , most importantly , the crisis is no excuse for protectionism .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy project and broadband internet .
i see three main priority that we should focus on .
the third point : the key is to restore confidence in the market .
- ( et ) several important matter were agreed upon in the council .
is it a match for what is at stake ?
the european economic recovery plan introduced in november 2008 ha remained just word .
the decision we took there were fundamental and important .
many of you ask how we will tackle the problem of unemployment .
the summit will put forward concrete measure for the june european council .
many of your comment were concerned with the issue of eu openness .
it wa jiří paroubek , leader of the czech social democrat .
i would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution .
whenever i conclude , i see crowd coming in to listen !
american are coming closer to the need to reinforce the welfare system .
i consider this an important step towards a common energy policy .
i believe that the debate around the nabucco issue were unseemly .
- ( de ) madam president , it is perfectly simple .
common consular instruction : biometric identifier and visa application (
the performance and sustainability of the european aviation system (
i am referring to the two report which follow .
aerodrome , air traffic management and air navigation service (
substance that deplete the ozone layer ( recast ) (
the abb-abm method a a management tool for allocating budgetary resource (
mr guardans cambó , we will take this a a test case .
- madam president , the answer is 'yes ' .
ec-côte d'ivoire stepping stone economic partnership agreement ( vote )
- ( fr ) i agree to this procedure .
i believe that the rapporteur , mr ford , is in agreement .
ec-sadc epa state interim economic partnership agreement ( vote )
- madam president , i am quite happy to carry on .
ec-eastern and southern african state economic partnership agreement ( vote )
the fact that she is here for this vote say much about her .
have no fear , i shall not read the entire letter .
i should like this to be recorded in the minute .
what you have stated will therefore be dealt with .
a we seem to be in agreement , we can proceed .
stepping-stone agreement towards an economic partnership agreement between the ec and côte d'ivoire (
rapporteur . - madam president , i will be very brief .
- we have agreement , so we will continue with the vote .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
- madam president , defined external frontier are the essential attribute of nationhood .
i believe in equal treatment , and we can deal with an opinion .
that is perhaps a sign that he should reconsider his position .
on the marinescu report , i deliberately voted for the marinescu report .
they are late coming , but at least they are coming .
this issue is still regulated on the basis of the 1944 chicago convention .
that is an important step for a comprehensive guarantee of food safety .
the problem exposed is one that , actually , we have created .
there is now a new industry that ha been built in brussels .
it is not a manufacturing industry , although it doe create some job .
it is an industry driven by lobbyist and especially ngo .
yesterday we approved another report about dialogue with the citizen in europe .
- madam president , i voted against this report for two reason .
so for those reason i voted against this report .
we do not prioritise new issue which do not have sufficient resource .
the amendment call for the phasing-out of export subsidy without delay .
we all know that this is a vast overstatement of the case .
she is to be applauded for finding consensus on this issue .
this resolution suggests much to counter the negative provision of the original text .
the eib ha signalled that more monies are available .
i hope my word meet with your seal of approval .
we all know that the car industry is having some serious financial problem .
they are documented on a daily basis in all our national newspaper .
the car industry can not cope with the regulation that we have enforced .
i know the bit at the beginning perhaps cost me some second .
- and you managed to get daventry in there .
across europe it represents over 20 % of manufacturing .
our approach to industry during this economic downturn must be holistic .
however , this is only possible if the biometric data are recorded correctly .
in this sense , i agree with this report .
an update to reflect this wa therefore urgently needed .
the commission expects saving of between 7 and 12 % of co2 emission .
i support the rapporteur 's initiative which considers full transparency of charge .
an update to reflect this wa therefore urgently needed .
this will help significantly in seeing u through this economic crisis .
furthermore , novel food must not endanger or mislead consumer .
for these reason i voted in favour of the liotard report .
i have voted in favour of mr liotard 's proposal on novel food .
one thing is certain ; we did everything to make our air unbreathable .
in writing . - ( it ) i am voting in favour .
the review process must therefore take account of this new context .
that is why parliament can not now refuse to accept responsibility .
besides , this had been common knowledge for many year .
for this reason , i have voted against this agreement .
the profession in question can be perfectly well filled by our own worker .
food security and the protection of the fragile industry of acp country .
however , the progress made in just a few week is considerable .
so there will be no 'blank cheque ' : i abstained .
these fund represent additional resource and not merely repackaging of edf funding ;
these fund should be used efficiently to compensate the loss of custom revenue .
there are in fact several point of the proposal with which i disagree .
sale are down , stock are increasing , and redundancy announcement are multiplying .
they point to a further fall in sale of new car .
among them are fund to assist training through lifelong learning .
this must be balanced with environmental and social condition .
yet writing a blank cheque is , of course , no solution .
we must not subsidise old technology that are on their way out .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the report 's second objective is to strengthen cooperation in practice .
in fact i arrived only this morning from washington .
this is the best possible agenda for the 21st century , too .
i think that we can fully understand this kind of statement .
when we agree , we can set the term of the global agenda .
this is because the choice of u president matter to european .
president obama ha indicated a new approach to the challenge we face .
many in europe were attracted to this change and the spirit of change .
high expectation were created on both side of the atlantic .
all these initiative are what many in europe have been calling for .
i welcome the pragmatic approach which ha characterised these early contact .
your report is a valuable contribution to that process .
these interconnected topic are of concern to a great many european .
we must also secure backing from advanced developing country such a china .
we must also coordinate our policy for enhanced growth and employment .
thirdly , afghanistan is a key issue for both europe and the u .
there is much that we can do together here .
the initiative taken by the czech presidency serve to underline this point .
we have a new opportunity this year to develop the relationship further .
that is also why i appreciate this timely debate .
we are looking forward to a busy eu-us calendar .
i believe we should focus initially on a limited number of priority .
protectionist element on both side of the atlantic need to be resisted .
the last european council in brussels made a great step in that direction .
your report very rightly place a heavy emphasis on this issue .
we should concentrate on getting a deal at copenhagen in december .
the eu also play a major role in our eastern neighbourhood .
the first aim is to recover from the crisis .
either we recover together , or we will not recover .
it will allow better burden-sharing in observing both party ' international responsibility .
in this light , we support the recommendation of the report .
u abolition of the death penalty would similarly represent global leadership .
but such cooperation can only be supported if it delivers fair treatment .
i am not only talking about iran , iraq or afghanistan .
the very principle of international order are wavering because of international terrorism .
mr millán mon 's report brings up all these important issue .
the same applies to issue such a torture and rendition .
in other word , it make it impossible to prosecute them .
that can lead u to underestimate the significance of this all , however .
the position taken in the report is unaccountably circumspect .
the job wa well done and there is no need for fundamental change .
he is right to refer to truly shared political and social value .
what of the common area of concern - china - mr millán mon ?
let u just do a quick comparison with europe .
china 's gdp is catching up with that of the u .
we need to remind ourselves of what we want to achieve .
i am thinking about a change in our attitude towards the usa .
europe 's ambition is to be a significant international actor .
i am thinking of european institution , european university and european foundation .
the negotiation with iran must be transparent in all aspect .
europe 's high expectation of president obama must now be backed by action .
- ( sl ) the new transatlantic agenda wa new in 1995 .
we are not dealing with a financial or economic crisis alone .
we are also dealing with a global leadership crisis .
we need to advance on a number of front simultaneously .
take for example afghanistan , which several member have mentioned .
this is something that we must discus very specifically .
now the question is how to implement it without losing time .
this report once again prof this , and i therefore congratulate the rapporteur .
europe is extending an open hand to the united state .
first of all , cooperation in the area of security must continue .
then came the eight black year of mr bush 's presidency .
he fundamentally divided european government , although public opinion not so much .
in conclusion , i would like to add the following reflection .
obviously , the primary impetus for this must come from the law-makers themselves .
let me also speak briefly on the transatlantic economic council ( tec ) .
we will , therefore , continue to raise this issue .
this will be very advisable and beneficial for both side .
europe , on it turn , ha no better partner than america .
interim trade agreement with turkmenistan - interim agreement with turkmenistan ( debate )
- the next item is the joint debate on :
we look at central asia differently than we did a few year ago .
we would probably then move for a postponement of the vote .
let u remember that certain positive social sign have appeared there .
i would just like to comment on what the previous speaker said .
freedom of information in this country leaf a great deal to be desired .
there have been numerous false report by so-called non-government organisation over recent year .
however , we can see that the new president ha started numerous reform .
for a long time it ha been a very inward-looking country .
there are many aspect to the union 's relation with turkmenistan .
the fact that turkmenistan border afghanistan make it also a strategically important country .
turkmenistan is critical to regional security and the fight against drug trafficking .
this dialogue ha also been matched by some important development within the country .
all this is evidence that turkmenistan is moving ahead .
the current contractual arrangement with turkmenistan provides for only a rudimentary bilateral dialogue .
such agreement already exist in the case of kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan .
indeed , the new leader are demonstrating a more open attitude .
however , the interim trade agreement is clearly not a cure-all .
clearly , turkmenistan is crucial to the success of this project .
speak in your mother tongue , if this is possible .
explain abbreviation that you use in what you say .
remember that joke are difficult to translate , and talk to the interpreter .
i welcome this report and congratulate mr caspary on it .
turkmenistan 's energy and foreign policy are closely linked .
monitoring doe not mean that we want to sit at the negotiating table .
by the way , i think you have done great work .
so , between these two extreme , what should we do ?
we know that negotiation are under way , but they are not completed .
my group 's proposal is both ambitious and realistic .
we can not sabotage our own policy by renouncing our value .
well , we should take two pencil , one in each hand .
thank you , a always , for your understanding .
i freely admit that the government under president berdymukhamedov ha made progress .
at the very least a position statement should have been made on this .
i hope that we shall together unanimously document this tomorrow .
thirdly we have asked for the release of all political prisoner .
it is interesting that both the council and commission concentrated on internal travel .
we said there had to be external travel freedom a well .
is this really a country that we can do business with ?
why have thing changed since the trade committee passed it resolution in 2007 ?
it is to do with self-interest at european union level .
journalist and defender of human right there have been gagged .
woman and child continue to be raped and trafficked .
yet we maintain strategic relation with both these large country .
therefore i generally support better relation between the eu and central asian country .
so let u avoid being hypocritical , let u make it plain ...
now the final speaker , mr martin , ha the floor .
- mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
how practical will a human right clause actually be ?
some of u also touched on cooperation with the red cross .
he engaged the president in ashgabat in exactly that kind of conversation .
so we have to help turkmenistan to help itself .
let me also say a few word about suspension , or possible suspension .
the commission can make a proposal to that effect .
it ha taken u much further down the line .
it would not have been a good idea to postpone the vote .
this ha been acknowledged by some representative of civil society in belarus .
se we can not deny that the picture is mixed .
this should be the way forward in our relation with belarus .
these were the consideration which lay behind our decision on 16 march .
we hope that the dialogue will continue over the coming month .
we are convinced that we need to be constructive with minsk .
we remain realistic and do not expect any dramatic change .
belarus is one of the six eastern partnership country .
belarus ha taken measure that are unquestionably along the line of more democracy .
but political repression still remains a serious problem in belarus .
minsk think that it is not acceptable to support the opposition like that .
there are a couple more point i would like to add .
more must be done from the country itself and in the country itself .
my final comment is on a somewhat more personal note .
it turn out , however , that this ha not happened .
participation in the european union 's partnership programme offer such opportunity .
i am convinced that the people of belarus increasingly want this .
i will give the floor to just three member .
that is not in accordance with our rule of procedure .
mr beazley , the point of order ha been clarified .
- ( lt ) today the people of belarus are marking independence day .
i hope that repressive measure will not be used against them .
i repeat : intervene when citizen ' right are violated .
- ( hu ) european policy on the belarus issue wa unambiguous .
human right and the process of democratisation were the most important .
the eu institution have succeeded in killing off their own set of condition .
it should not stab the democratic force in the back .
this ha nothing to do with what wa said earlier .
i firmly believe that president lukashenko should not come to prague .
i am therefore unable to give him the floor .
naturally , other issue remain , not least the university issue .
on the issue of visa , the situation is equally clear .
the vote will take place during the next part-session .
it wa a turning point for u and for europe .
the european union stand for everything that is the opposite of totalitarianism .
it is something to be valued and never taken lightly .
thirdly , we owe it for the sake of our child .
there are lesson to be learnt from our totalitarian past .
human right and freedom can not be taught in a vacuum .
it is about value more important than party difference .
the study will be completed by the end of this year .
is the commission providing funding from the europe for citizen instrument ?
those crime must never be forgotten and we must honour the victim .
what are the dividing line between politician and historian ?
what do we want to commemorate , and how ?
we , a a group , will certainly get involved .
pacification is not possible without processing the past and acknowledging the truth .
yesterday in parliament we celebrated the european day of home-made ice cream .
it is intolerable and unbearable that in twenty year this ha not happened .
the radical right need it also because of the forthcoming election .
it ha nothing to do with objective , genuinely independent assessment .
there are already enough historical institute and centre dealing with that .
yes , it is necessary to investigate and justly condemn the crime .
for that poem osip mandelstam wa sent into exile .
he died near vladivostok , on the way to his destination .
in december 1938 his body wa placed in a common grave .
osip mandelstam symbolises the million of victim of 20th-century totalitarian regime in europe .
the europe of today should remember the victim of 20th-century totalitarian regime worldwide .
at the same time we see the entire history of the 20th century .
we want to face up to this problem seriously .
half-truth , one-sided interpretation and the denial of historical truth weakens european .
it poison our common future if we fail to acknowledge this properly .
that is why it is hitting out at communist and ruining socialist/communist prospect .
they have defended their ideology even with their life .
we will not be signing any declaration of repentance for the imperialist .
their overthrow is a social need and we shall serve it consistently .
china is therefore the first country of which i think .
may a many of u a possible support the prague declaration .
this is important , because the shadow of the past have not disappeared .
left and right are both found in a democratic system .
the inhuman face of communism wa leonid brezhnev and his predecessor and successor .
but , minister , your country suffered : jan palach lost his life .
'do n't forget u ' is what your brave countryman said .
this evening , commissioner , we do not forget those who suffered .
i wa never a communist and i have always condemned communism .
it wa a totalitarian , criminal regime , just like nazism .
. - ( ro ) communism is a deceitful philosophy .
communism must be condemned with all the mean at our disposal .
democracy ha provided freedom of thought , expression and movement .
- madam president , there is a further dimension to this debate .
that is a symptom of having been sent to siberia .
those who survived know what that suffering wa like .
i think we should speak openly about both of these form of totalitarianism .
the greatest crime wa ignored because of due process .
even at that time , the west capitulated morally to the soviet .
but there is no reason to stay limited of mind and fearful forever .
that is the aim of the platform of memory and conscience .
why is it important to have such a platform at the european level ?
this is also a chance to combat the relativisation of past crime .
secondly we must retain historical awareness a part of european education .
last but not least is the question of where the debate should lead .
the presidency is short , lasting just six month .
this debate is just one step but other matter will follow .
we must do much more at the member state level .
the vote will take place during the next part-session .
this is precisely the principle on which the parliamentary election must take place .
however , the problem in bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite .
a a result , this make them much le willing to vote again .
i urge parliament not to sit back and do nothing .
this is not a matter of celebrating the suffering of million of people .
strengthening security and fundamental freedom on the internet ( debate )
today , every time i read a newspaper , i leave a trail .
i look forward to it being approved by plenary .
indeed , these two objective can and should be pursued in synergy .
again , these two goal are not mutually exclusive .
we already have a number of binding international instrument on this subject .
this constitutes support precisely for strengthening the right of user and consumer .
this will be an important basis for the monitoring of civil right .
the report brings necessary measure not a moment too soon .
their proposal weaken civil right and the privacy of citizen .
up to the present day , the internet doe not forget .
there is a clear connection between this report and the telecom package .
it provides greater opportunity for citizen to scrutinise the decision-makers .
if this amendment should get through it would represent a setback for democracy .
it is a democratic right to be able to express different political view .
these restriction have resulted in a security risk for citizen .
i urge you to give great backing to this report tomorrow .
allow me to give you a couple of example .
another issue that is close to my heart is file sharing .
this is a matter of particular concern to parent .
i appeal to manufacturer to respond to our suggestion .
i wish briefly to pick out a couple of point .
unfortunately the report remains more ambiguous and even dangerous on other point .
law must apply to the internet a they do everywhere else .
the rule of law in our democratic society is at stake .
i therefore believe that the lambrinidis report cover these concern .
i come from estonia , which is a world leader in internet availability .
these term are often infiltrated by slang , cynicism and even vulgarity .
it is an aspect of the internet that need our attention .
we have to make sure that minority also feel protected .
yesterday 's trialogue give a lot of hope for final agreement .
rapporteur . - mr president , i would like to thank the commission .
the amendment , however , are anything but balanced .
they call on u to totally abandon fundamental right to protect something else .
political speech ha to be protected , especially when it is controversial .
this reference in the report doe not talk about 'criminal ' speech .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
in writing . - i congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
i believe the internet ha enhanced european ' life in countless way .
we spoke during the last part-session on the need to tackle child pornography .
we have gladly taken on board the profound change the internet ha wrought .
this white paper on sport is making good progress in implementation .
it started in football and i believe it will continue in other sector .
there are two approach to the specificity of european sport :
firstly , the specificity of sporting activity and sporting rule and
the european minister for sport repeated the request to the commission in biarritz .
can it tell u when they will be available ?
this brings me to another , closely related , point .
dynamic change in society are being accompanied by change in sport .
we are going through a specific crisis in sport .
among other thing , doping and trade in youngster are on the increase .
there are , therefore , a considerable number of threat and doubt .
there always remains , however , a question about detail .
there is a clear link with the question tabled by mr batzeli .
the question is which interest and which principle prevails here .
commissioner figel ' , what is your view on this ?
but sporting organisation and many governing body think this is a bad thing .
are we looking at a wider range of sport ?
member of the commission . - mr president , that is true .
there is a shorter version and also a version with annex .
it should be adopted by the council of health minister .
we can not have one large specific set of guideline for everything .
europe need to be more active and more united .
we have spoken to m bozkurt about this code of conduct .
we have the council of europe , we have a convention on this .
in 2001 we adopted decision or agreement on international transfer .
of course it is not an absolute rule but it concern specific arrangement .
we give preference to , or promote , specificity under certain rule .
in substance we can not say that we agree with the study .
on this specific matter of 'six plus five ' we will continue further .
they do not want to get into formal dispute .
we agreed to make room for more expertise and for more exchange .
i spoke about transfer under 18 year of age .
safe and environmentally sound recycling of ship ( debate )
this go not only for bangladesh but also for other asian country .
i have already remarked that the effort of individual state will not suffice .
a global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed .
continuing to debate the definition is not in the interest of environmental protection .
secondly , running ship aground for on-site dismantling must be regarded a unacceptable .
fourthly , certification of dismantling yard is to be welcomed .
however , the european commission appears to be reconsidering this position .
regarding funding , there is no fund or mechanism for the time being .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
this applies in particular to the taking of evidence and cost .
the directorate-general on competition and the commission have gone straight for litigation .
we are convinced that the european commission urgently need to rework this question .
now competition law is going off and creating such an instrument .
consumer protection is coming along on the same issue .
we are also pleased that this report strongly support the white paper .
to this end , therefore , collective redress mechanism must include appropriate safeguard .
this solution is very important for case of lower and fragmented damage .
so , please - a european system a soon a possible .
among other thing , it requires effective antitrust legislation .
we should not create regulation based on wishful thinking .
the rapporteur intends u to avoid an 'americanised ' compensation culture .
on the contrary , the risk of such a culture occurring are high .
there is no objective analysis of what is required by the subsidiarity principle .
paragraph 7 and 11 together instil a sense of misgiving .
europe must have a european system , not an american one .
if we do nothing the situation will only get worse .
last - but maybe not least - what wa said about out-of-court settlement .
i think that we all pulled together and achieved a good result .
i think the commission should consider this very seriously .
you spoke earlier of convergence with the work of the directorate-general on competition .
why doe this not apply to the european commission ?
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .
( the sitting wa opened at 10 a.m . )
this is all the more significant because of the current economic crisis .
much controversy ha surrounded the legal basis of the programme .
the commissioner can count on the support of parliament in this matter .
by adopting the report parliament will send a positive signal to our citizen .
the programme confirms that the eu feel responsible for it most needy citizen .
often they are people with disability , or even child .
until now , the programme ha been financed exclusively by the community budget .
you suggest that storage cost should be covered a well .
i hope minister have used the waiting time constructively .
austerity , yes , but not where the poorest people are concerned .
the eu wa itself supposed to be a region of general prosperity .
madam president , commissioner , the food aid programme is essential today .
the programme ha helped one in six of the people in need .
the sustainable european model of agriculture of 1997 is a propaganda myth .
it is high time that these policy were changed .
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
i have here some statistic which list the price of food .
it would be a disgrace for europe if we did not rectify this .
the commission proposal can and must , however , be improved .
in 2006 in the european union 13 million resident received food aid .
the commission 's proposal really doe not match economic reality .
madam president , feeding the hungry is a basic precept .
it would be very hard to find a better and more nourishing food .
therefore i reject those amendment aimed at altering the legal basis .
that mean there are eight member state not participating .
keeping food price a low a possible ha great social and humanitarian significance .
the rapporteur , mr siekierski , is now proposing the removal of co-financing .
the european union must be clearly focussed on the well-being of the people .
however , we must ensure a clear allocation of responsibility .
change to the content must always be seen in the overall context .
the economic crisis threatens to increase the size of that group .
direct supply of product will ensure a varied diet .
i hope that amendment 17 , 18 and 19 will remove this flaw .
the distribution programme is helping many of these european .
there are two thing i would like to ask of the european commission .
she ha made her mark on the history of european agriculture .
family from small town and rural area are hardest hit by poverty .
unfortunately , it is an issue that all member state have to face .
i think the provision are reasonable and well balanced .
so i look forward to the vote of this extremely responsible parliament .
let u give ourselves time and not do this during the crisis .
finally , i would like to go back to source .
according to official statistic around 80 million european live below the poverty line .
our system of social care is also far from perfect .
the next item is the commission statement on collective redress .
this is the very nature of redress that we are aspiring to .
we have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue .
i think that remains at the heart of what you are discussing today .
for this reason , it is very important that we address this issue .
that in our opinion mean that we must not disregard this model completely .
france , sweden and poland have reported similar case and injury .
we need an instrument to deal with this problem .
in my opinion , it is right to consider something like this .
we have often seen such example in the past .
the commission should not make the same mistake again in this case .
it should advocate a horizontal approach right from the outset .
i know that is one of your most important preoccupation .
a m mccarthy also mentioned , this is about damage .
in this respect , i would like to stress the following .
discouraging unmeritorious claim , a referred to by mr rack : yes .
each of the two initiative ha a distinct focus .
the option presented in the green paper must be discussed in detail .
white paper on damage action for breach of the ec antitrust rule (
therefore i ask for a vote in favour of this report .
we are in the european union , not the soviet union .
the report deserves a proper debate in which all opinion can be heard .
it is unacceptable that our new rule prevent this .
i ask you to reject the two alternative resolution .
although they are based on my report , they are not impartial .
the state of transatlantic relation in the aftermath of the u election (
the procedure asks whether a speaker wish to speak for or against .
i shall put the request for postponement to the vote .
we in the service were not in receipt of this information .
only the final vote shall be postponed , then .
can those member who oppose it please stand up ?
( parliament approved the request by mr goebbels to hold the vote again )
there is just one slight point of confusion for me .
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
your comment will be passed on to the competent body .
this is to say nothing of the economic implication of counterfeit good .
i drew up the opinion in the committee on foreign affair .
these are not the aim of a social and free europe .
i am concerned that the cost of input have risen .
the price for fertiliser and feed have gone up .
healthy food is what must be made the heart of the matter .
that is the real signal that must be sent out .
we serve nobody by failing to recognise that essential point .
this is the game that we came here for .
'because [ he ha ] nothing else here for you ,
and just because it 's easier than the truth ,
oh if there 's nothing else that [ he ] can do - '
'luck ha left [ him ] standing so tall . '
and praise ring in the heaven , for spandau ballet have re-formed !
this report is about the united state and us-eu relation .
of course america remains fundamental to europe 's security and prosperity .
sadly , in this house there are many example of anti-american sentiment .
we support president obama 's commitment to multilateral engagement with the european union .
that is one of our fundamental right and freedom .
the other half of that money would be better spent on poverty reduction .
perhaps that is a way of reconciling the european public with 'europe ' .
poverty is one of the most serious problem currently facing the european union .
the agricultural budget should not be used to implement social policy .
forging an economic alliance is therefore vital to both .
it is also a particularly significant sign in the current context .
however , some of the wording in the report are too far-reaching .
small and medium-sized food-processing company have also suffered severe consequence .
farmer generally receive around 8 % of the final retail price .
traditional romanian product must be supported on the european market .
this is necessary in order to make european agriculture profitable .
in our opinion , this is certainly not the most elegant of report .
many point are worded in a long-winded way or duplicated .
this may sound like a nice idea , but is impracticable .
in agriculture , we consider this an important point .
we have voted against this report on food price in europe .
the consumer is ultimately the one who pay the product 's overrated price .
the rise in food price in europe is clear for all to see .
it is a terrible problem requiring immediate action from the european union .
i feel that the power in question should be immediately transferred to euskadi .
this ha caused people to have reservation about the spanish justice system .
i have a nagging worry that such intervention may not be the solution .
we must tackle these problem together , with determination and creativity .
on account of this bias , i voted against this report .
transatlantic cooperation must not ignore the role of nato .
freedom on the internet is the best guarantee of freedom of expression .
in a word , the internet ha become part of our daily life .
this is particularly the case where political action is concerned .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the role of culture in the development of european region ( debate )
we implore the commission to do it part , too .
the commission regularly organises conference with representative from local and regional authority .
it is also the centre of , certainly the british , cultural industry .
economic revival always follows the year of cultural event .
and i think that his characteristic self-criticism could be a signpost for u .
i am glad that this subject ha been raised .
in my view multilateral support for the european region is very important .
there are many more example of this in central europe .
in my region lie the historic county of northamptonshire .
i hope that it will receive the support of member .
her speech wa the intellectual foundation document of the european parliament .
border , at least on the continent , are mostly rather artificial .
these are element of production and commerce which serve to meet fundamental need .
culture is an expression of the soul of the region .
maintaining culture is expensive , and our role is to support culture .
the culture of the region need support and protection .
regional culture should therefore be supported if only for this reason .
madam president , i rise to support my colleague , zbigniew zaleski .
they say that 'the hand that rock the cradle rule the world ' .
i would , however , like to express some general point and reaction .
the vote will take place during the next part-session .
written declaration included in the register ( rule 116 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
( the president declared the sitting closed at 3.50 p.m . )
i declare resumed the session suspended on thursday 26 march 2009 .
these boat were carrying people from north and sub-saharan africa .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
recommendation to the council on the new eu-russia agreement ( debate )
the report highlight the need for meaningful dialogue on security matter .
that would involve agreement on the status of abkhazia and south ossetia .
the crisis and it implication continue , certainly , to overshadow our relation .
our support for the territorial integrity of georgia is clearly one of them .
we should not be discouraged if it only move slowly at first .
in general we share many of your concern a well a objective .
this is particularly important in relation to our common neighbourhood .
it need to be pursued through both political dialogue and joint initiative .
but of course the devil is in the detail .
mr president , russia is and will remain an important partner for u .
this is right at the top of our list of priority .
our treaty should emphasise respect for these shared commitment and interest .
we can not permit the creation of new sphere of influence in europe .
this report should have served that purpose , but it doe not .
the socialist group agrees that parliament should express it rightful criticism of russia .
the socialist group firmly condemns violation of human right .
we demand that democratic right and fundamental value be respected .
the russian law on ngo endangers the independent operation of these organisation .
so our concern is not with the criticism , but with the style .
it is not didacticism that is needed , but justified criticism .
my group commends it content and congratulates janusz onyszkiewicz on his work .
election , a we know , are no exception .
the eu 's leader were conspicuous by their absence .
mr solana and commissioner ferrero-waldner were nowhere to be seen .
this lead directly to political pressure by moscow on individual member state .
and what do we , the eu , bring to the negotiating table ?
that is not , a you will surely admit , a proper game .
another example is last week 's renewed imbroglio in ukraine .
they are not about dictatorial demand and harsh condemnation .
this entail both party engaging in mutual consultation on difficult issue .
the united state ha a different strategy at present .
contrary to the impression given , the copenhagen criterion do not apply here .
i am in favour of a pragmatic approach based on interdependence .
we must conduct these in good faith whilst also respecting russia 's interest .
we want to avoid at all cost fighting over sphere of influence .
not everything is hunky-dory in eu-russia relation , of course .
we have condemned russia 's invasion of georgia and continue to do so .
unfortunately , he ha yet to fulfil this promise .
therefore , the core element of the agreement must be energy partnership .
russia is a very important partner for the european union .
normal partnership are based on two reliable party that trust each other .
however , the relationship should go further and be more ambitious .
this is one of our weakness and one of our problem .
we will never remain silent when human right are being abused .
it is therefore particularly important for the eu to speak with one voice .
this should be a precondition for holding further talk on an agreement .
there is nothing more important than freedom , health and life itself .
that is true , but there is no need to repeat it .
last august , russia almost occupied a sovereign neighbouring state .
which one will have more impact on russia 's behaviour ?
there can be no question of condoning violation of human right .
so the real key is how russia see power .
in the european tradition , power should be supervised by democratic institution .
this is very dangerous for state that russia see a weak .
they automatically become target for the expansion of russian power .
for my part , i think it is a terrible document .
it is a question of realism , first and foremost .
with this approach , europe can have no claim to leadership .
i hope that the commission will not accept these recommendation .
this is a global challenge and a challenge which demand mutual responsibility .
in my opinion the report lack balance and is russophobic .
negotiating a new agreement will therefore be difficult and painful .
i must remind you of what i have actually proposed in my amendment .
i can support much of what ha been said here .
it ha to reflect the reality of today 's cooperation with russia .
the objective is to promote trust and transparency in eu-russia energy relation .
we can not afford another disruption of the energy supply .
we should also strengthen the early warning mechanism and make it more operative .
the new agreement is one way to do this .
this is , a i said before , a relationship of interdependence .
on human right we do not always see eye to eye .
we also use our twice-yearly human right consultation to do so a well .
both are there , and this is the content of our mandate .
( pl ) the position is therefore quite clear .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 2 april 2009 .
i welcome janusz onyszkiewicz 's report on eu-russia relation .
we have a responsibility to avoid triggering a new gas crisis .
russia is an important partner for the european union .
interdependence may be mutually beneficial but it doe not have to be so .
whether this actually come about largely depends on the russian side .
russia may opt for the west 's value and standard .
nobody will force russia to make such a choice or indeed any other .
acting to the detriment of this world would amount to suicide .
relation between the eu and russia suffered a great blow last year .
the report contains an extensive list of issue that must be settled .
president medvedev and prime minister putin exert their influence over the russian medium .
russia play a leading role on the international stage .
it is also a major energy supplier and an important trading partner .
in my view we should speak out against russia loudly and clearly .
this wa brought out in the resolution parliament adopted in october .
only three eu member state have territory within the arctic region .
this report highlighted the new strategic interest in the arctic region .
this last point wa covered in last october 's resolution .
this is one of the key element in the communication .
we fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the arctic region .
we agree that the europeam union should have a comprehensive and coherent policy .
that is a clear warning sign we would be foolish to ignore .
the unclos is also the basis for settling dispute , including maritime delimitation .
this mean either extending existing legislation or adopting new legislation .
coastal state should avoid discriminatory step concerning navigational rule .
maybe in the future we will not need those fossil reserve at all .
russia took the initiative in 2001 , hence the current unrest .
we want a north pole that is clean and above all without troop .
we should build on the work of the arctic council .
our group will not therefore support the 50-year moratorium .
i have seen hundred of thousand of fish dumped in the north sea .
the european union want u to meet our objective of renewable energy .
mr president , yes , the commissioner is right .
it is not an unregulated landmass like the antarctic .
at most there is a need to adapt the instrument already in place .
it is good that the eu is focussing on the arctic region .
russia and the u will not accept it under any circumstance .
i would just like to recall the council 's conclusion from december .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 2 april 2009 .
the report we are discussing today touch the heart of our society .
i have looked forward to today with eager anticipation .
there is a great deal at stake in tomorrow 's vote .
parliament ha always opposed the hierarchy of ground for discrimination that ha arisen .
many of her suggestion have been incorporated into the text .
in my opinion , we have succeeded in doing this .
moving on to the content , the report prohibits discrimination on four ground .
not all distinction are regarded a discrimination , however .
you do not want to see equal treatment legislation full stop .
thus you are not making amendment , you are rejecting the whole proposal .
this is where our path diverge - no middle ground is possible .
i know that the problem of multiple discrimination is fundamental to you .
i fully agree that the directive should not apply to purely private transaction .
the position of the commission and parliament are very similar here .
let u just hope that we get that large majority .
people of a different religion should not be discriminated against .
the socialist group in the european parliament ha supported this comprehensive horizontal directive .
this directive doe not close or complete a cycle .
is that a serious question that we are allowed to ask ?
can you imagine that a black female wheelchair user can feel discriminated against ?
very few country are familiar with the concept of multiple discrimination .
therefore , we call on parliament to retain these important provision .
lady and gentleman , i would ask you to support this directive .
yet treaty , convention and solemn declaration are of little use in court .
european citizen must be given an instrument to enforce their right .
the buitenweg report ride roughshod over these limit in every respect .
it overturn guarantee for national family and adoption legislation in amendment 50 .
this is the basis for the today 's debate .
an important freedom is parent ' choice of a school for their child .
this proposal doe not comply with the principle of subsidiarity .
this doe not change anything in substance , however .
leave to member state what is theirs , for heaven 's sake .
then there is the criticism of the reversal of the burden of proof .
i must draw your attention in particular to multiple discrimination .
the commission omitted to include this in it proposal .
we therefore propose a precise definition of these type of discrimination .
you have stated fantasy , you have not stated reason .
we will not allow human right to become a plaything for populist scaremongering .
if ever there wa a subsidiarity issue , this should be it .
another legally accepted designation can be found for other partnership .
paradoxically , the left intends to discriminate in this way .
at this point in the debate mr špidla will have to speak .
the basic question is what doe this directive defend ?
we are talking about human dignity and it is the same for everyone .
from that moment this concept ha echoed through the whole of history .
the first question wa about the creation of senseless additional bureaucracy .
i think that this can be rejected for one simple reason .
however , i would like to say something about the burden of proof .
similarly , i think that people in this parliament are opposed to discrimination .
i think that the same thing will be happening in your country .
we ought therefore to avoid infringing subsidiarity or creating excessive restriction .
some fellow member seem to be particularly quick to take offence .
i tabled amendment on strengthening equality body , which already exist .
that is the reality for ten of million of european citizen .
the important thing is that we manage to come to a decision .
freedom for religious educational institution ? of course , 100 % .
let u not add further exception to those that already exist .
this is now coming , finally , to fruition .
this help can come from u in different shape and form .
that is purely and simply what we are doing here .
frankly , this promise ha taken too long to be realised .
i condemn the conservative who want to make that delay even longer .
i would ask our german friend not to block it , please .
let u actually raise our vision and get this agreed .
i hope very much you will be able to do that .
what you really want is the rejection of the entire proposal .
in the netherlands , for example , they perform some social care service .
these are the very specific point that are mentioned in the report .
the vote will take place on thursday 2 april 2009 .
my reservation regarding the report in question derive from this preliminary consideration .
indeed , there can be no hierarchy among discrimination .
discrimination is a serious problem in europe and beyond .
i firmly insist that we must combat every form of discrimination .
that can not be the raison d'être of a progressive anti-discrimination policy .
it is especially important that the directive cover all discrimination criterion .
or should i say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow ?
a rapporteur , therefore , i should like to point out the following .
cohesion policy is a powerful lever for stimulating the real economy .
this will increase the contribution made by cohesion policy to combating climate change .
these recommendation were the subject of a commission communication adopted on 16 december .
however , accessing the fund is not an end in itself .
in romania 1.4 million flat urgently require investment for renovation .
we are here in comfortably heated and well lit surroundings .
commissioner , we listened to you carefully just now .
however , we especially love it when these text are applied .
we can but hope that the little drop will be a revitalising one .
i can but reiterate my hope that all this will prove revitalising .
they cause a strain on economic , social and territorial cohesion .
why is there no commission action plan on regional policy ?
however , we shall be re-tabling them and requesting a roll-call vote .
on behalf of the gue/ngl group . - ( ga )
mr president , i would like to welcome mr angelakas ' report today .
while this package will not solve all their problem , it will help .
in this way we are working together with our citizen a partner .
( pl ) mr president , we are today discussing particularly important change .
( hu ) i think we should actually be celebrating today .
a significant proportion of the eu population life in tower block apartment .
renovating settlement that have been set apart is simply pointless .
it will eliminate the delay in implementing the fund 's aim .
this is just one of the many improvement proposed .
lump sum payment and speeding up expenditure on large project are also advocated .
i think this support should be very warmly welcomed .
this may entail reprioritising part of their operational programme .
checking negligible item often cost much more than the item themselves are worth .
we need to look at subsidy and various tax incentive .
in addition , this house inspired more confidence than the european central bank .
today the latest unemployment figure were announced in ireland .
i am sorry that amendment to these report were not approved .
madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
the commission therefore set up a working group on simplification in november .
this crisis is actually causing genuinely difficult situation and poverty for european citizen .
i have a few comment to make on what we have just heard .
an increase in the adaptability of worker and enterprise ;
together we ended up in this crisis and together we must overcome it .
all the aforementioned change involve increasing the liquidity of beneficiary .
they deserve wholehearted support and should be implemented a soon a possible .
secondly , by implication , a reduction in energy import .
in every country in europe , unemployment ha grown by leap and bound .
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
madam president , infrastructural development is crucial to our economic recovery .
during the crisis we should cut the allowance allocated to meps .
the reason are not known , the consequence are criminal ...
i trust this success will be maintained during the remaining three month .
this is a 3 % reduction compared to the figure for last year .
are we somehow going to extend the remit of information channel for europe ?
in my country , no debate whatsoever on europe is taking place .
the problem affect migrant group particularly severely and the rom community .
many company use child labour in spite of the relevant legal restriction .
there are thousand of breach of labour legislation in member state .
we have often emphasised how our culture is enriched by it diversity .
a a result , the vulnerability of european consumer will continue to grow .
their plane wa shot down between 15 and 16 march 1944 .
they were part of 97 squadron based at raf bourn in cambridgeshire .
this morning there wa an explosion at the ananiev-tiraspol-ismail gas pipeline in transnistria .
the danube must be given a higher priority within the community 's policy .
national consultation with slovak citizen took place on 28-29 march .
this wa during the sixth anniversary of the imprisonment of 75 opposition representative .
loss at sea of migrant ' boat off the libyan coast ( debate )
the number are shocking , and yet europe and it government seem distracted .
what this mean is that certain european government are playing with fire .
we need to see thing a they really are .
these tragedy demonstrate the terrible face of our fortress .
doe that mean that we should give up on negotiating ?
thank you , sarah , for your close cooperation .
i would like to extend a particularly warm thank you to them .
these effort should enable u to reach an agreement at first reading .
these rule will also be applied in a more harmonised way .
i would of course like to thank mr henrik lax and parliament .
this step is urgently needed in a european union with open border .
we are also pleased that we have achieved most of our objective .
that is the way you have approached this in it entirety .
this is a brilliant example for the rest of the house .
i am pleased to say that we have the multiple-entry visa .
that wa mr cashman 's aim for the border code .
so i feel that meps have delivered on those two aim .
now , in many member state , such a right doe not exist .
we are against such a wide introduction of biometrics .
regrettably , however , the visa fee is unchanged at eur 60 .
the vote will take place on thursday , 2 april 2009 .
evaluation of the driving hour and rest period ( debate )
the commission is also working actively on improving the digital tachograph .
the member state must therefore develop specific equipment to monitor the tachograph .
this is one example of the problem encountered by driver and transport company .
this is dangerous for all the other road user .
i am not advocating the harmonisation of all the sanction .
this must remain a competence of the member state .
this problem quite simply represents a serious distortion of the internal market .
what is more , it took six hour to settle the fine .
a a dutchman , i am thinking primarily in a southerly direction .
thousand of vehicle are standing idle because there are no job for them .
mr lichtenberger reminded u of the importance of these provision for road safety .
we have reached an agreement on the key issue .
under present legislation they are often forced to resort to unlicensed medicine .
it is also an important component of the commission 's legislative simplification programme .
sincere thanks once again for your excellent work , mr doyle .
despite these effort , the situation ha continued to deteriorate .
bee are a very important minor use/minor specie ( mum ) issue .
many of u may think that this report is also of this nature .
education is the key issue in the integration process .
mobility should also be a key component of teacher training and professional development .
i am delighted that there is such a broad consensus on these issue .
i also support the idea that the directive 77/486/ec is outdated .
the education of migrant ' child is a step in this direction .
these child must have the same right a other child .
this is precisely why we need to support member state in finding solution .
my report also call for a number of measure aimed at providing solution .
health concern associated with electromagnetic field ( short presentation )
no debate , no speaker on behalf of the group , nothing .
for ten year our parliament had not taken up this issue .
this approach , therefore , is not the right one .
problem and prospect concerning european citizenship ( short presentation )
these are challenge for both the central and local authority .
the libe committee took a very constructive and practical approach in it work .
the issue here is something very important : european citizenship .
the forthcoming european election are one of the priority of interinstitutional public relation .
these are precisely the principle on which the parliamentary election must take place .
however , the problem in bulgaria of vote buying indicates the exact opposite .
a a result , this make them much le willing to vote again .
i urge parliament not to sit back and do nothing .
unfortunately , however , this principle is not always fulfilled in reality .
i welcome the fact that the report specifically mention the rom .
european conscience and totalitarianism ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
i am grateful to them all for their excellent work .
their valuable contribution ha made it possible to achieve agreement at first reading .
to date , our experience with the ecolabel ha been patchy .
rapporteur . - ( it ) i accept your invitation .
the commission set a target of increasing that to 35 000 participant .
that is a very ambitious target . it is almost a 10-fold increase .
particularly important to me is the introduction of sectoral support document .
they will see this kind of initiative by the commission a a distraction .
it is positive that agreement can be reached at first reading .
the scope of the revised ecolabel regulation ha also been extended .
i trust that parliament will fully support this positive bundle of proposal .
my thanks once again to the rapporteur for their excellent work .
i am afraid that the compromise achieved is not sufficient in the circumstance .
marketing support for this label ha been very limited in the past .
i thank all those who have been involved in the work .
i think we have done quite a good job in a few week .
we can have a ban on dangerous substance and subsidise green technology .
but in a market economy there are other tool a well .
the issue of foodstuff ha also been widely debated .
in this case the criterion should be further developed .
i think we have achieved a very good result .
we use resource quicker than they are able to replenish themselves .
this ha to change if we want to prevent an environmental crisis .
and the power of one is perhaps something we have not promoted enough .
it also provides mean to reduce animal testing and child labour .
ireland and europe can benefit by further promoting and using the scheme .
this is important for the credibility of the ecolabel .
what doe environmental sustainability mean for the ecolabel , though ?
all this amount to nothing le than a revolution .
congratulation again to the rapporteur for his excellent report .
so what can we say and add to what ha already been said ?
we have an international iso system that everyone is aware of .
this is borne out by the number of registration .
there are 4 000 company in emas and 35 000 in iso 14001 .
and so is emas , the eco-management and audit scheme .
emas is saving resource : among them , water .
first revision of the emas scheme wa not encouraging .
the rapporteur , mr mcavan , added valuable additional modification .
it would help organisation to proceed more easily from iso to emas standard .
and then there is the whole story surrounding ecolabelling .
a jumble of symbol alienates consumer rather than informing them .
i thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with regard to my proposed amendment .
at present national ecolabels are more widespread and better known than eu ecolabels .
for the time being it popularity lag behind the international iso 14001 standard .
in my opinion , both report contribute to movement in this direction .
the european ecolabel relates to all product and is a very valuable addition .
the european ecolabel , however , ha been languishing away for many year .
it will also contribute to a reduction in water consumption .
your visitor will know that they are well represented .
in my opinion consumption is the fundamental characteristic of the consumer society .
we have gone through a period of enormous desire for consumption .
1 ) in relation to the ecolabel regulation 's relationship to upcoming fishery legislation
finally , just to thank everybody again for their contribution .

bi-annual evaluation of the eu belarus dialogue ( vote )
you can not always just make oral motion without information .
i would not like to delete the truth now .
please agree that 'truth ' be inserted : reconciliation with truth and remembrance .
i would therefore ask you to add my name .
the role of culture in the development of european region ( vote )
recommendation to the council on the new eu-russia agreement (
in her conclusion , she specifically referred to the timing of our motion .
the house had a resolution on this issue in october of last year .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
i welcome the report of mr takkula and i have supported it .
this ha nothing to do with the culture of the european union .
in fact , european citizenship is highly artificial in nature .
it should not be diverted and it should not be shared .
i reject that philosophy a i reject the lisbon treaty .
of course there should be a referendum on the lisbon treaty .
i did not realise our british colleague were citizen .
but i have no difficulty with the word 'subjects ' and 'citizens ' .
i really do not understand the point that ha been made here today .
mr president , may i concur with the last speaker .
these are different dimension to our identity and our citizenship .
of course , no citizenship of that kind ha been attributed by referendum .
change , a much else , begin at home .
but surely the european parliament should be setting an example .
ten member state have still not transposed the existing anti-discrimination directive at all .
mr president , i abstained on this matter for two reason .
first of all , we all accept some discrimination .
we are a world away from the real situation .
i regret all of the controversy that ha surrounded this report .
what this report doe is to correct an anomaly .
mr president , this report rest on a conceptual misunderstanding .
it is natural for distinction to be made on the basis of nationality .
for that reason i voted against mr buitenweg 's report today .
i voted for both part of recital 17 , amendment 28 .
it is for that reason that i voted for the report .
i should nevertheless like to make a few comment .
it is unfortunate that we have let both these opportunity slip .
truth and memory have an important role in connection with this .
it is here , my friend , that you make your bloomer .
the european union is not safeguarding democracy , either internally or externally .
now of course , one ha to be careful making such parallel .
it is not with totalitarian method that one can fight totalitarianism .
there were two interesting sentence in the report that merit further attention .
i really wonder whether there is need for such a debate .
the clue is in the phrase , and the answer is 'socialism ' .
we should be careful it is not the first step towards totalitarianism .
( it ) mr president , soviet totalitarianism did not only imprisoned people .
europe must demand this , it must achieve it .
the evaluation of historic fact is the job of historian and historian alone .
mr president ha this house no sense of self-awareness ?
my friend , culture can not be created by bureaucratic fiat .
this is pointed out in our resolution , and i support the position .
it is kind of you to bring me on now .
that is something we should make clear at all time .
education is indeed most often the foundation for achieving our objective .
it mean the failure of their future prospect in life .
i also have other objection to the schmitt report , though .
finally , it is vital that these are simplified .
mr takkula 's report raise a significant social problem .
this is the first and a fundamental step towards full integration into society .
'the content and organisation of education and training are national competence . '
i think the answer lie in the paragraph quoted above .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused eu .
i can only admire the opportunistic hypocrisy of my tory colleague .
for these reason , we voted against this report .
for these reason , we have abstained on this report .
we believe that action should be taken to assist all vulnerable pupil .
mother and father are the most important people for a child .
this also applies in the poorest family and in immigrant family .
even in immigrant family mother and father are different but complementary .
i simply want to assert the universal general declaration of human right .
such issue are the individual responsibility of each member state .
i find this solution to be pointless and superficial .
we should strive to remove existing barrier a soon a possible .
concrete step have been taken to make european citizenship a reality .
the report by mr gacek on union citizenship is a real fraud .
this is a serious attack on national identity and cohesion .
deep down , though , that may be just what you want .
the key point addressed in the new text include the following :
i agree with the aim , but not with the method .
however , there is no mention of this in the report .
it go without saying that we voted against the report .
i voted against mr lax 's report on the community code on visa .
eu visa policy should reflect the fundamental priority of it foreign policy .
for these reason , it is essential to vote yes on this legislation .
that can not be the raison d'être of a progressive anti-discrimination policy .
that is why we have decided to abstain on this report .
in writing . - ( nl ) i emphatically voted against this report .
the question is only whether europe should be involved in this .
measure to tackle discrimination should remain the exclusive competence of the member state .
then the principle of equality may a well be done away with completely .
it ha broad support from social platform and civil society .
it is important that we continue to support these group and their work .
equally you can not with impunity shout 'fire ' in a cinema .
the pitfall in such a coercive regulation are legion .
however , legislation in this area must be well thought-out .
the cda is opposed to the proposal to reverse the burden of proof .
to u , someone is innocent until proven guilty .
i voted against amendment 81 to totally reject this report .
at council many member state have also voiced concern about the proposal .
in such case my party , the dutch socialist party , object .
the different form of discrimination are a significant problem .
horizontal legislation in this area is therefore to be welcomed .
however , this resolution ha no impact on the legislative process .
it is up to the council to reach a unanimous decision .
i have also always been involved in protecting these people .
these form of discrimination have never been defined in any eu document .
nobody can precisely define sexual orientation or discrimination based on sexual orientation .
this represents a potential danger for the interpretation of this directive .
non-discrimination based on `` belief ” is also problematic .
would any of the eu country agree to such condition ?
no-one is under any illusion that the situation in belarus is ideal .
they must not be held a 'hostages ' by the authority .
franak viačorka is the son of a well-known opposition activist .
conscription should not be used a an instrument to conduct politics .
this is why i abstained in the case of amendment 19 .
i voted in favour of the resolution on totalitarian regime .
we did vote in favour of the resolution a a whole , however .
the goal is to put neo-fascism in a good light and condemn communism .
this task should be left to independent academic research and public debate .
we therefore chose to abstain in the final vote .
we condemn the atrocity of both nazism and stalinism .
i can identify with the first group , but not with the second .
a a result of their violence , both group will be forever reviled .
nobody remembers their cause , but everyone remembers their mean .
ideologically they are promoting capitalism a the only 'democratic system ' .
this is why i can support this motion for a resolution .
the evaluation of historic fact is the job of historian and historian alone .
nazism and communism are ideology that were actually inspired by older ideology .
this resolution discus issue which lie outside the european union 's competence .
in writing . - russia remains an important strategic partner for the eu .
it is first and foremost with her that we should have privileged link .
for our part , we reject this type of relationship out of hand .
we acknowledge the common threat of nuclear proliferation , particularly from iran .
2 per cent of the population is waiting for cataract operation .
the waiting list saga is one of many example supporting my statement .
i voted against the own-initiative report by mr ries .
schooling is a fundamental issue that we should today reaffirm .
it call , moreover , for increased financial support for establishment in difficulty .
unfortunately , mr schmitt 's resolution fails to keep it introductory promise .
i vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused eu .
i therefore voted against both the own-initiative report and the alternative resolution .
it go without saying that we voted against the report .
this leaf doubt a to the direction of the change .
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute

absolutely no one , and least of all mr wallis .
have i now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake ?
is it a new earthquake , doe it have a different cause ?
i have been told that this wa not the case .
at least ask whether the member agree with that decision .
the decisive factor is rule 132 , by which we are bound .
the request should have been made an hour before the sitting .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
firstly , targeted intervention by multilateral and regional financial institution ;
secondly , coordinated public intervention at national level ; and
over 20 people , including child , were burned alive in a building .
this caused and is still causing great anguish throughout poland .
there wa no kidnapping , either on 9 april or ever .
not one of these attack ha come under investigation .
our society ha become gripped by a sense of fear and helplessness .
again , eu credibility and authority are at stake .
i beg leave to delay the house and thank you for this opportunity .
we no longer control our own border and suffer unlimited and uncontrolled immigration .
this would be an important , positive sign for europe .
unfortunately , there is little confidence in the police .
do we not even have the least concern for our reputation ?
twenty-two eu country are participating and five country have decided not to participate .
( hu ) the new hungarian socialist government wa formed yesterday .
more than a third of the member of the german government are woman .
mr president , the other day i wa in birmingham .
this really is a matter of urgency - human and economic urgency .
two year is really far too long to wait .
i think we should take this fact into consideration .
there is nothing decent or honourable about terrorism , past or present .
shame on any member who proclaims such obscene adulation of men of blood !
we have to take decisive action against such provocation .
it is making a mockery of all democratic standard .
any power which is afraid of the press will first strike against them .
it is time for u to take stock of the situation .
the next item is the joint debate on the following item :
we will also see the end to discriminatory pricing on prepayment meter .
we are also going to see a strengthening of national regulatory authority .
however , with greater power there should be greater accountability and transparency .
let me first emphasise the increased form of accountability that we have negotiated .
finally , we have introduced requirement for streamlined decision-taking .
i hope that the agency will rise to the challenge we have posed .
i must admit that parliament hoped for a much more ambitious agency .
what are the specific step we intend to take ?
moreover , an a-class tyre is more cost-effective in the long run .
tyre manufacturer also stand to benefit , of course .
these are argument that hold water and that can not simply be ignored .
i should like to add a brief comment about the noise emission criterion .
i should like to conclude with a word about the time frame .
i await my fellow member ' comment with interest .
the trialogue ha now succeeded in agreeing to the compromise .
i would like to highlight a few key issue .
most importantly , we have also seen development on the ground .
this proposal will provide consumer with standardised information on fuel efficiency .
it is important that we find the best way of displaying the label .
madam president , thank you mr piebalgs for your focussed speech .
it is about reducing member state ' dependency on single outsource country .
somehow it is a pity that we are ending this energy package .
i want to spend the few second i have here on internal market .
this is very important for small eu member state .
for example , the issue of it headquarters remains open .
firstly , security of supply - and this ha been achieved .
secondly , the principle of open competition in the european energy market .
the long-term plan should include both gas supply network and regional interconnection .
this is an important stage that we have reached .
we have a lot of work ahead of u .
through this proposal we can promote a truly competitive market in greener good .
this is the first time that such text have been drafted clearly .
i believe that this legislation will continue in this direction in the future .
it represents a major step forward for our citizen in europe .
i am satisfied with the package that is to be adopted .
this is legislation that is being adopted by debate and through compromise .
it is far from perfect but it is definitely a step forward .
but there is a huge amount more to do .
what we have at the moment is the worst of both world .
so that is the ultimate resort , should this legislation fail .
finally , could i restate the case for competition ?
that is why it is a good thing to do .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
cheap energy meant that no one worried about heating cost .
today nearly 100 million people live in prefabricated building .
the new regulation may boost competition in the eu electricity and gas market .
this will also result in major difference breaking up the eu energy market .
planner and building inspector will receive appropriate guidance from this directive .
that option is now extended to all member state .
this is especially important in the present economic condition .
we , the european community , have set ourselves a very ambitious task .
ultimately , it is always the consumer who pay .
the regulation which we are going to adopt tomorrow is a short-term solution .
some of these mean are even suggested by the regulation .
we now have an average penetration rate in europe of 119 % .
at the same time , national price are going down .
thank you to parliament , which ha acted very swiftly .
transparency is vital to the functioning of a market .
now i call mr ţicău to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure .
the european parliament is definitely working in the interest of europe 's citizen .
in fact , we have all quickly adopted this tariff reduction .
however , reducing text message charge is especially important .
citizen should , therefore , have extensive and easy access to telecommunication service .
this is the first step , and i think that others will follow .
these are factor which may accelerate realisation of the lisbon strategy .
this is important for the education process and for the young generation .
my congratulation once again and thank you very much .
i think it is a great moment for the internal market .
we would all agree that the market is not working .
how we should regulate it is a matter which we can still discus .
i hope that we can find alternative method in the future .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
our debate is based on the position of the european court of auditor .
such possibility exist , and we share this point of view .
the sample taken for the audit included six state and 250 transaction .
i hope that the commissioner will confirm this fact .
drawing up and signing cause a great deal of ambiguity .
preventing irregularity also help in assessing the benefit we achieve from allocating fund .
this wa public money - it did not come from the financial market .
i fully agree with the opinion of the european ombudsman in this respect .
there are , of course , a very large number of them .
the budget and the number of staff have also increased .
in 1995 , 38 people , on average , worked in each agency .
therefore we are not yet able to grant it discharge .
this is why we are postponing the granting of discharge .
in the draft resolution before you ( paragraph 58 ) , the rapporteur ...
so i will do this , 'sans délai ' .
so there wa too much carrot and too little stick initially .
obviously , five year for our action plan wa not enough .
the so-called negative da is part of the court of auditor ' opinion .
but we face a highly politicised and often deliberate misinterpretation of this sentence .
for urgent , more guaranteed result , one could imagine three option :
we contacted several national delegation : they all agreed ; nobody acted .
'simplify ' is a nice word which everybody like .
it mean reducing the number of transaction from million to a few thousand .
but it can not stand the test of perfection .
the eu wa created to bring peace and prosperity .
but audit perfection is a rare phenomenon anywhere in the world .
thank you for your attention and please vote in favour of discharge .
mr president , employment policy is included within cohesion policy .
for this , i offer my very sincere thanks to everyone .
this observation compels me to say that our report are also very important .
it is unfortunate that these came at the end of the period .
i do not have enough insight into this at the moment .
the committee 's excellent report clearly reveal the serious shortcoming that exist .
allow me to quote from one of these report .
the eu member state must finance themselves and not tax their neighbour .
what is happening is unethical and we have to take action against it .
this figure is almost double the amount allocated under the 9th edf .
freezing fund is no solution to the problem , however .
the audy report make suggestion a to how this could be improved .
the process ha always been complicated , but always constructive and very professional .
so thank you all for this contribution to the complicated discharge machinery .
we raised the issue , but these are now merged .
four year to see this kind of proposal maturing is not too long .
( ro ) mr president , commissioner , my speech will be brief .
in short , i believe that we have a series of joint responsibility .
the summary is done at the end of this mandate .
if we do not discus fact then we will have to discus rumour .
i am very grateful to mr costa for what he said .
we established a statute for assistant and we were also criticised for this .
i hope that you or your successor will clear this up accordingly .
i am very pleased to be chairman of this committee .
it is important for parliament to be united on these issue .
a lot of people have been criticising this fund for many year .
we are all being affected by the global financial crisis at the moment .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 april 2009 .
the european monitoring centre for drug and drug addiction in lisbon ,
i would like to make the following point on the latter two agency :
complete disclosure and inspection of eu expenditure is essential .
from my perspective this highlight the importance of nuclear power .
i hope that council will be able to take this decision this spring .
i have tried to position my report in three way .
de facto , their transposition into binding community legislation would bring legal certainty .
it ha absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard .
we have tried to make further improvement through our proposed amendment .
i am grateful to our rapporteur , mr hökmark .
more must be done in relation to this in future .
i would like to thank you for your cooperation and for the discussion .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
in addition , there is a health hazard which can not be estimated .
tile in open place were visibly stained by a rust-coloured substance .
it resulted that those stain were a result of discharge .
the commission will examine carefully the consequence of adopting any such broader definition .
there is no question therefore that we need to act now .
solving it requires real political will and action on the demand side .
parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen .
in fact , the commission ha condemned this situation recently .
in addition , we have requested that community inspection system be strengthened .
this in turn undermines conservation and effort management initiative .
control failure thus contribute to the negative performance of the common fishery policy .
in order to achieve this , the reform is built on three ax .
axis 2 : instituting a global and integrated approach to control and inspection .
axis 3 : the effective application of cfp rule .
the current proposal doe not try to change this allocation of responsibility .
thus , amendment 41 on corrective measure can not be accepted .
amendment 47 deletes the entire section on real-time closure of fishery .
real time closure are directly linked to control issue .
moreover , this provision already exists in current legislation .
in the same vein , amendment 61 can not be accepted .
this would seriously undermine the capacity of the commission to apply this measure .
acceptance of these amendment would simply mean maintaining the status quo .
amendment 114 proposes the deletion of article 101 on emergency measure .
this report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient control system .
i would like to apologise for taking up so much time .
article 5 of the constitution of the portuguese republic could not be clearer .
i have said for year , 'be careful what you wish for ' .
if you get this power , you can come back year after year .
so , commissioner borg , my advice is 'sling your hook ' !
( fr ) mr president , thank you for sète .
we have regulated their fishing since 1983 , so for 26 year .
what is more , it is still not working .
that is the path , mr president , that brussels must also take .
well , after that torrent of word , mr stevenson ha the floor .
such proposal therefore make it easier to fight against centralisation and bureaucracy .
we do not need this at the centre of it .
it must be the exception and not the rule .
get the balance right , please , commissioner borg .
( pt ) mr president , commissioner , your proposal is absolutely fundamental .
i should like to warmly congratulate him on his exemplary work .
this is only fair for the professional fisherman that we address this .
i myself took part in such a conference in scotland some time ago .
in this regard , the proposal respect the principle of proportionality .
exemption will be examined further within the final presidency compromise .
may i also acknowledge the effort everyone ha made on this .
in any case , special resource are available for this from the commission .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
conservation of fishery resource through technical measure ( debate )
such derogation should be part of the regional regulation .
we are more restrictive than you tend to be .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
this case highlight the need for a common policy .
thanks to their intervention , reason triumphed over dramatic antic .
we must now ensure that the commitment stipulated in this pact are implemented .
i would like to underline the general convergence of our idea .
in various part the busuttil report urge the commission to take action .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
europe definitely need a common approach to immigration in the eu .
to achieve that objective , more effective cooperation is needed .
allow me to elaborate on some of the issue raised in the report .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
this will require the legislation to be restricted only to cross-border case .
small business are affected disproportionately by people defaulting on payment .
i call on the commission to act on parliament 's recommendation with urgency .
i would also like to thank m gill for the report .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
annual report on the deliberation of the petition committee 2008 ( short presentation )
this committee that i sit on is a peculiar committee of parliament .
some of the major one relate to water quality .
we have called for the commission to take action in this regard .
this demonstrates the useful direct contact with the citizen that the committee provides .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
gender mainstreaming in the work of committee and delegation ( short presentation )
at the general directorate level the representation of woman is still insufficient .
the work ha been unanimously adopted in committee and i value that highly .
the model is described in detail in the explanatory statement .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
this report also make a number of forward-looking recommendation .
gender equality is one of the basic principle of community law .
we hope that this latest position statement will yield more result .
in 2006 , 32.6 % of manager in the eu were woman .
green paper on the future of ten-t policy ( short presentation )
for 15 year , project were presented , list discussed and decision deferred .
it now need to be adjusted to new challenge .
this underline the determination of both institution to develop a future-oriented ten-t policy .
elimination of the comprehensive network would therefore have some perverse effect .
the vote will take place on wednesday 22 april 2009 .
currently , section of the network are being built in member state .
in connection with this the financial need of the investment are changing .
( the sitting wa closed at 11.45 p.m . )
the recent conclusion of the g20 have further strengthened this determination .
it is , of course , something which we are coming back to .
amongst them is the issue of management of risk .
i hope the commissioner will agree with me about that .
these will be discussed by the head of state or government in june .
the situation in the eu financial sector is serious .
moreover , a comprehensive supervisory regime will be put in place .
the commission is very pleased with the outcome of the codecision process .
the current solvency regime is over 30 year old .
for several reason , administrative burden hit smes harder than bigger company .
instead we must strengthen our effort to ease the burden on our company .
four presidency have been involved , including the current one .
the rating agency regulation represents an important step forward in this sense .
the regulation also ha a strong symbolic value , however .
one good thing is that there is to be only one rating category .
i hope that my fear will prove to be unfounded .
there are no comparable rule in any other eu regulation .
we shall have to endure many year of very little competition .
we are not on schedule ; we are not up to speed .
speech about action do not guarantee that the action will be effective .
it is rooted in the social and environmental sphere .
this is what guide u in our choice of vote .
we fully support the gauzès report and the progress it make .
i believe that such a method will lead to further disaster .
the commission ha yet to even consider this solution .
why should this principle be restricted to sovereign debt , however ?
nobody understands it - least of all the fsa .
there is no legal recourse at all if they get it wrong .
what action is needed to resolve the terrible crisis that we are experiencing ?
china is not the only state in this situation , however .
i am glad the scope is restricted to rating used for regulatory purpose .
we must be on the look-out for unintended consequence .
that is ultimately the way to make a statement .
let u acknowledge that and be radical and brave .
more regulation and more supervision are the 'in ' thing .
allow me to summarise the cause in 50 second .
people depositing money in bank know that there are deposit guarantee .
the banking directive is due for adoption in may .
not only hedge fund but also private equity investment need to be regulated .
all executive pay with a bonus component should also have a loss component .
all of these centre were supposed to have been properly regulated .
the g20 intends to regulate only speculative fund that pose a systemic risk .
the systemic risk becomes apparent afterwards , when the crisis ha erupted .
all pig are equal , but some pig are more equal than others .
let u therefore make a start with new financial moral .
these were not new phenomenon ; the bubble had indeed grown very large .
it is unacceptable for there to be no regulation in this field .
we can not wait for the united state on all the issue .
then we shall have made our contribution to overcoming the crisis .
secondly , we should consider the level that is under scrutiny .
the actor within the market transcend border and have become international .
a it happens , the rating agency allowed for this .
the same scenario unfolded in the case of solvency ii .
we must also limit risk-taking and put a stop to excess .
the free market also need it boundary and rule .
a a liberal , i can also agree with this , of course .
let u not forget that the market economy creates prosperity .
the fundamental question is , therefore , where did that trillion come from ?
so europe is reacting , albeit slowly , but better late than never .
we are in the process of simplifying administrative procedure .
but i would like to point out two pitfall here .
these report are in analytical tune with the lamfalussy follow-up report of parliament .
i believe that this , too , is important .
i am pleased that everyone ha now seen the light .
the eu member state are deep enough in debt a it is .
we asked you for a legislative initiative in this area last september .
what have you been doing since then , commissioner ?
of course , this is not the end of the story .
let u hope that we can get that back .
many aspect of this report make it a world leader .
my second point is about the strategic impact of using such legislation .
i do not wish to discus here the importance of rating agency .
the eu must guarantee that rating agency operate according to clear regulation .
we do , however , live in exceptional time .
the council ha announced that it will not be making a statement .
the debate will therefore continue with speaker from the political group .
this is the second time : we already increased it in december .
mr mccreevy ha congratulated u on the promptness of our action .
a you know , the procedure comprises two stage .
the first is the consultation ; the opinion on the council regulation .
europe ha contributed to increasing this funding whilst also assuming it own responsibility .
i regard this a a responsible course of action .
therefore , the limit of eur 50 billion is completely justifiable at present .
this will be le expensive and will give the european union greater stability .
however , commissioner , that also depends on u , the union .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
agreement between the ec and pakistan on certain aspect of air service (
animal health condition governing the movement and importation from third country of equidae (
trade arrangement applicable to certain good resulting from the processing of agricultural product (
rapporteur . - ( nl ) i can be very brief .
we discussed the first reading of this dossier le than a year ago .
we managed to work well with the european commission .
this will introduce substantial europeanisation into the important field of measurement .
the commission thanks the rapporteur for the support given to the commission proposal .
protocol on the implementation of the alpine convention in the field of transport (
many thanks to all the member who contributed to this .
request for defence of the immunity of aldo patriciello (
request for defence of the immunity and privilege of renato brunetta (

reporting and documentation requirement in the case of merger and division (
insurance and reinsurance ( solvency ii ) ( recast ) (
this , of course , is not the end of the story .
i urge you to recognise the statement by the council and the commission .
common immigration policy for europe : principle , action and tool (
lady and gentleman , i should like to welcome you all most warmly .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
it is a scandalous waste of taxpayer ' resource .
we should not be choosing to come to strasbourg at all .
i think there are particular danger for a country like britain .
it is time to have more faith in the market .
in this matter we need to find the right sort of balance .
energy efficiency in tyre manufacture must not be allowed to override safety .
that would be in the interest of the public .
i have to say we were not disinterested party .
who ha the power , and over whom doe he wield it ?
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr skinner on this report .
some will be surprised that it ha taken this long !
but it is good to have him in the centurion club .
i voted for the hökmark report for all sort of reason .
mainly because , well , who could be against nuclear safety ?
i am all for nuclear safety and all for nuclear energy .
i am therefore glad that , today , amendment 48 ha been approved .
the problem wa that people were not enforcing existing law .
it is time to have faith in the market .
so , europe , intervene , lay down some definite rule !
( lv ) thank you very much , mr president .
in writing . - ( it ) i am voting in favour .
so there is no absolute need to guarantee legality placed on the company .
still , i had to vote against this today .
this initiative form part of the global strategy to protect critical infrastructure .
in writing . - ( it ) i am voting in favour .
protection of public figure is the responsibility of the hosting state .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
i should like to point out the following in this connection :
the call for gender equality is not an attack against men .
the measure will combine increased energy efficiency with lower cost .
however , i voted for the internal market gas and electricity package because :
there is neither a european energy grid nor a strategic energy storage policy .
these are the reason which led me to vote for this report .
this is a matter for each member state to decide on .
i have therefore voted against the proposal tabled by the committee .
the third energy package fill many of the structural gap from the past .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
the latter would have been contrary to the environmental objective laid down .
previous experience of labelling , in particular , give cause for careful consideration .
take the labelling system for household product , for example .
we need tyre to be safer , more fuel efficient and quieter .
we must monitor , though , how effective the label are .
this is a concrete example of how the eu affect our day-to-day life .
whether they are used for business or private purpose is of secondary importance .
the globalisation of trade , business and communication is all part of this .
a a result , this report on the mobile communication market is vital .
this generates unnecessary cost which have to be borne by the company .
i joined my colleague in supporting the legislation proposed by mr caspary .
in writing . - nuclear energy is a reality in europe .
there are massive amount of untreated nuclear waste being stored in pond b30 .
i voted for the amendment which were aimed at strengthening this proposal .
i accept that those who work in the industry are dedicated professional .
in 2009 , it ha already been announced that 225 will go .
euro-globalist interest and the dogma of free trade are why .
thirdly , this legislation will be impossible to comply with .
a law that is impossible to implement is a particularly bad law .
on the other hand , i am not particularly surprised by the proposal .
anyone who get in it way will be mown down .
that issue is overfishing by industrial fishing concern in their factory fishing vessel .
we believe that in the national interest the immigration pact wa not satisfactory ;
given the current problem with mass immigration , this is a crazy proposal .
we might a well open the floodgate fully , then .
a common approach on immigration in the eu is imperative .
it aim is also to firmly combat illegal immigration .
the excellent report presented by mr busuttil respect this approach .
for some country migration is a huge social , financial and political problem .
for others it is a minor phenomenon which doe not generate much interest .
the policy should be the polar opposite of this .
europe 's door would be opened wide to the developing world .
for these reason , there is no option but to reject this report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
earthquake in the abruzzo region of italy ( debate )
a team of eight national and commission expert wa selected .
the team wa despatched to the site of the earthquake on 18 april .
there are mechanism for providing help , and the commission service acted immediately .
everything must be done in close collaboration with the italian authority .
it will do so in this case a well .
my colleague danuta hübner will visit the area soon and discus concrete possibility .
once more on behalf of the commission i express our condolence .
we will do whatever is possible to help people in this disaster area .
2007 discharge : eu general budget - council ( debate )
i just want the president to guarantee that the council ha been invited .
is it because we suspect some fraud or irregularity ?
so why , then , have we done it ?
naturally , it could have done so by replying to our question .
what fund did they cover and what were they spent on ?
we on the committee on budgetary control are nice people .
where is the deputy secretary-general , since he is not at this debate ?
the auditor say that this section should be eliminated .
the socialist group is in favour of postponement for four reason of principle .
the first is the credibility and the role of our own parliament .
so we are not saying we want to do something else .
we are saying we want to do our duty .
the third reason is the respect and the preparation for the lisbon treaty .
our role a a parliament is accountability vis-à-vis the citizen .
the report on the council 's discharge is very long and thorough .
it is also based on reference to document and the eu treaty .
we should not let them run ring around u .
this is not acceptable in a democracy . it ha to stop .
hence the justified demand for an activity report , transparency and clarity .
in 2006 , the council spent eur 12.6 million on travel .
this money wa intended to be used for interpretation .
the council also ha confidential account , so-called comptes hors budget .
i would like to ask why this ha not happened .
how many such account are there alongside the budget ?
the council 's job is to answer our question .
why is the council refusing to cooperate on this ?
how corrupt are these people , and how lacking are they in transparency ?
congratulation to the rapporteur , who asked straightforward question and received no answer .
the problem lie in the capital city , not brussels .
in my view , it behaviour is sometimes rather too cowardly .
after that , we shall take a look at the consequence .
it wa precisely for this reason that we chose this time .
i agree that the council 's absence from this debate is unsatisfactory .
dialogue and effective democratic control are a reality here .
i wa mentioned by name ; i wa accused of making nonsensical remark .
sometimes it can be proven that they prefer to attend party conference .
( the president cut off the speaker and called him to order )
this is something that simply can not be said in a proper democracy .
even then , it applied only to the administrative part .
perhaps we can start the discussion all over again !
i am sure the minister will take that message back to prague .
i should like to thank the council , and also the commission staff .
more than half of parliament 's amendment have been accepted .
these lead to distortion of competition and weaken national undertaking .
yet we did reach a compromise , and it wa a good one .
yet we should not wait two year before applying this regulation .
six month for cabotage and the 12-day rule should suffice .
everyone demonstrated a constructive approach in negotiation in order to achieve second-reading approval .
the commission welcome the introduction of a new 12-day rule .
this , too , help to ensure road safety .
we are pleased that this expires in six month ' time .
instead of more freedom , haulier are faced with more restriction .
i would like to make a similar point about international coach transport too .
the thwarting ha been fierce , which is very bad news .
the content of this proposal is both wrong and unenforceable .
he will be supported by the christian democrat in so doing .
i therefore believe that the position adopted is ultimately the right one .
thus , i am grateful to the two rapporteur .
the council disagrees , but i think this is one concession too many .
for there , too , driver are cheaper than in belgium .
president pöttering confirmed the eu make 75 % of the law .
so , here we are , making legislation to correct legislation .
unladen journey are already being reduced and the environment protected .
the increase in safety and reliability will be palpable .
the first one is , indeed , access to the profession .
this ha now been clarified a three time over a seven-day period .
you are very often alone in the car in strange surroundings .
our common aim is to make road transport more efficient and sustainable .
mr sterckx , do you wish to speak on a point of order ?
the other thing i want to say here concern cabotage itself .
i thank fellow member once again for their cooperation .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
this ha therefore been dealt with in the text .
the recently submitted commission proposal will complete this legal framework .
there are huge difference even within these individual branch .
this issue is of particular importance in the current economic situation of course .
i wa also pleased to hear what mr svoboda had to say .
among these , those who use inland waterway represent just a small minority .
i think that a single legislative instrument must be the answer .
we enjoyed constructive cooperation in the committee , which produced good result .
there are just a few point on which i should like to expand .
in other word , we must take great care .
i think we have added another few element to the right of passenger .
a i keep having to say , the problem are far too great .
not a national or regional parliament , but the european parliament .
i therefore hope this text will be approved by tomorrow 's vote .
i hope that this also gain acceptance in one form or another .
now , unfortunately , this effect is not being achieved .
there are many task for the next commission in this regard .
in this union , it is also essential that passenger come first .
so first the service and then compensation for delayed service .
i am certain that europe is moving towards a better future .
europe is not the preferred destination amongst our own people .
every rule adopted is the product of compromise , of protecting different interest .
for the rest , i believe that there is a consensus .
it specifically concern the movement of person across the czech-german border .
the next item is question time ( b6-0227/2009 ) .
the following question have been submitted to the commission .
there exists a strong potential for cross-border trade in on-line commerce .
this is an important citizen ' europe issue , especially in the recession .
surely that is not all to do with regulatory difference .
will the commission also crack down on sheer exploitation ?
that would be an objective way of looking at it .
but you can not discriminate under any other basis .
it also support the development of innovative good practice through it funding programme .
this is a public health emergency for an ageing population .
subject : impending recession in south-eastern europe and implication for the european economy
i am replying on behalf of my colleague , commissioner almunia .
the initiative ha been accelerated and implementation is now starting .
it is highly likely that montenegro will also request it .
the efta surveillance authority ( esa ) is in charge of it implementation .
the esa may also investigate alleged incompatible aid granted by these efta country .
will the commissioner investigate this matter and use all her power to assist ?
the latest technical meeting took place on 13 february 2009 .
in 2004 , the commission started investigating restructuring aid for the polish shipyard .
that should maximise opportunity for viable economic activity to continue at those site .
we know a couple of example where shipyard were closed .
subject : on-line sale of perfume , clothing and brand product
mr rübig asked what we can do in the present situation .
subject : state aid for small and medium-sized enterprise ( smes )
member of the commission . - i will do my utmost .
this initiative wa previewed in the commission 's recovery plan the previous month .
in other word this measure is of particular benefit to smes .
can these worker-related measure be subsidised at the same time a the enterprise ?
member of the commission . - that is an intriguing question .
the following action have already been implemented in the framework of the strategy .
of course this is also very valid for marine and maritime research .
member of the commission . - neighbouring country of course can be included .
but i would like to be even more precise .
so all these country have exactly the same right and obligation .
subject : evaluation of creativity , innovation and technological development in member state
for detailed information i would refer the honourable member to the report itself .
in total , 74 % of all participation were smes .
member of the commission . - the first question wa quite specific .
but i think that we have to look at that .
could the commission state what new measure are envisaged for bonus-169 ?
will the proposal be presented during the present commission 's term of office ?
is there anything that might hinder the transition to bonus-169 ?
moreover , we also organise ad hoc meeting and open hearing .
we can probably use our representation office more actively .
we are trying out different method of how to engage with citizen .
vice-president of the commission . - i absolutely agree - 100 % .
so i definitely share your view on doing even more to mobilise citizen .
subject : the commission 's role and participation in the upcoming european election
commissioner , thank you for your information on the commission 's activity .
vice-president of the commission . - thank you for that follow-up question .
this is something that we will do in cooperation with the other institution .
we also have question-and-answer material that we have put together .
term of protection of copyright and related right ( debate )
this can be condensed down very simply into four very clear area .
we are now proposing , a part of a compromise , 70 year .
such an outcome will be a very welcome development for eu performer .
let me stress that this proposal is far from a simple term extension .
this 20 % is exclusively for distribution to the session player .
this is not a proposal for the benefit of record label .
this is a carefully balanced approach aimed at rewarding europe 's creator .
those who rely on copyright for their income would beg to differ .
the commission put forward this proposal in july 2008 .
for many eu citizen this crisis affect their daily life .
the next commission will therefore be called on to continue this work .
therefore , a balance will still have to be found along these line .
i consider the compromise to be satisfactory and welcome the success achieved .
i come from a point of view where i like copyright .
across the world society with strong ip protection move forward .
those that have fewer entrepreneur and fewer patent just go backwards .
session musician deserve the help they will be getting from this proposal .
that is why i am strongly in favour of this report .
it guarantee fairer condition for session musician in relation to soloist .
session musician will benefit from a permanent 20 % levy .
i recognise that it is not perfect and that there are concern .
so we should and we must become proactive and do something here .
let me explain how i arrived at this image .
moreover , this money doe not go directly to artist .
all in all , commissioner , this proposal is not appropriate .
we need , for example , to create something like a flat rate .
deal can only be done if there is an established law .
we already have an established law at the national level .
this time , however , i find it difficult to follow his intention .
will an extension increase cultural diversity and facilitate the writing of new composition ?
can we justify an extension that increase the term of protection so dramatically ?
in my opinion , these question have still not been answered .
it is my belief that the commission should try again .
commissioner , have a rethink , rework the proposal and come back !
we also ask for the whole directive to be rejected .
reject the requirement for 95 year and reject the entire directive !
i think this ha completely lost all sense of proportion .
but i will touch on some of the area .
but i wa lobbied fairly intensively by ordinary performer .
but the writer of the song is entitled to life plus 70 year .
from any type of moral perspective that is unfair .
we have done our best to get a proposal .
i shall just refer to some of the issue raised .
a 70-year term is open to all new innovative business model .
this is about the recording by the performer , not by the writer .
if they can not protect their creation , how will they do that ?
this is about allowing for proper mechanism to be put in place .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
copyright existed before the internet , and refers to a different era .
now a new approach to this matter is needed .
we still have to wait for a thorough revision of copyright law .
what we are going to propose is somewhat unprecedented .
because , today , 60 % of european live in the urban community .
that is why i should like firstly to thank mr savary .
today 's vote will not be the end of our dialogue on this .
so , how is that linked to our debate this evening ?
you have not answered our question today , commissioner .
we know that these traffic jam cost u 1 % of gdp .
i thank him for his commitment and for his specific proposal .
what we want to do here will help to protect that principle .
this should also apply in future to this issue .
he ha drafted a sound report in close cooperation with the shadow rapporteur .
legislative measure at european level are inadmissible for urban traffic .
brainstorming and encouraging the exchange of best practice make sense .
we do not all need to reinvent the bicycle .
they are important to the attractiveness of a town .
that would take some of the strain off a city .
it is also important to take account of demographic change .
in brief , that will promote a more humane life .
combining the potential of transport , information technology and telecommunication is useful here .
they lose a lot of time because of the bad organisation of transport .
well , this is not what this is about .
the answer is , firstly , it desire to act .
we can ensure that they make urban transport more attractive to user .
there is marco polo , which encourages the use of combined transport .
for this reason , making transport accessible and supporting interoperability are vital action .
another issue of the utmost importance is responsibility and division of responsibility .
and , a a result , we will not secure the necessary investment .
i believe we have succeeded in providing a consistent and convincing approach .
notwithstanding those reservation , i support the report that ha been submitted .
( hu ) madam president , commissioner , lady and gentleman .
the introduction of intelligent transport system offer numerous obvious benefit .
it is in all our interest to make this a reality .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
this is one big growth area year by year .
i wish mr jensen and the commissioner every success .
there are , in fact , an incredible number of good possibility .
ensuring continuity and reliability of it service in european transport corridor and conurbation ;
better integration of the transport infrastructure with vehicle and between vehicle ;
marco polo ii ha also felt the impact of all these problem .
so we have made the programme considerably more attractive .
i am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for that .
why should we not lower the threshold more for this sector ?
now there are real deal to be had at bargain price .
we must and will displace traffic wherever possible , but it is difficult .
mr blokland , you have already had an answer .
a a result , we achieved a great deal .
that really would be a pity , hence this compromise .
my thanks once again to everyone for their input .
crossing a border by train can still be difficult in many case .
unfortunately that much is true for both infrastructure management and investment .
the first principle is the identification of corridor and thus of the network .
this identification is based on economic rather than political factor .
the second principle is strengthened cooperation between infrastructure manager .
the rapporteur and the transport committee deserve to be congratulated on their work .
we need a different basis on which to calculate the number of corridor .
the debate ha demonstrated relatively broad agreement across the political spectrum .
his place is taken today by my friend and colleague , philip bushill-matthews .
they should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
the proposal before u now is our chance to make this a reality .
most people will always want to be treated close to home .
however , such prior authorisation must not be used to limit patient choice .
your report on these three topic have therefore come at the right time .
however , i can make a number of general conclusion at this point .
yesterday , here in strasbourg , we celebrated european patient ' right day .
this is a right that the treaty directly grant to eu citizen .
the directive provides a measured response to these requirement .
it would be a good idea if this were looked at again .
one way to solve the situation is through the possibility of inter-regional cooperation .
the report is based on patient ' need and not patient ' mean .
patient will always prefer to receive health care close to where they live .
i have one single point to make on the trakatellis report .
patient , too , are to have their right in the internal market .
at the moment , this is left to chance .
we need this , and it is a condition of our support .
that is expressly not what we are talking about now .
how can we make the system such that patient benefit from it ?
and if we do not do that , who will ?
that is why this is also a social directive .
that is what we are talking about here today , mr president .
finally , many thanks indeed to the rapporteur , mr bowis .
he ha done terrific work and i sincerely hope he get well soon .
indeed , today only 4 % of european citizen are treated abroad .
what , therefore , doe this directive need to improve ?
it will thus be an obligation instead of a right of the patient .
this mean that we are object , rather than subject .
patient should be subject , not the object of a marketing campaign .
i myself am a beneficiary of cross-border health care .
i wa lucky enough to be able to afford to pay .
i welcome this report and i hope it will get through today .
let u seize this law and put the patient centre stage .
it is only those who are desperate who travel abroad .
this is truly an improvement on the commission 's proposal .
the alde 's core amendment ha been to appoint a european patient ombudsman .
here is a case which is being handed to you on a plate .
i am thinking here of reference network and information point .
i would like to wish mr bowis a speedy return to health .
after all , they are at the mercy of their care provider .
to that end , patient right must , of course , be strengthened .
introducing patient mobility will not only have an impact on healthcare .
similarly , the financial service sector can also look forward to growth .
thing have largely depended on the sending country 's very latest regulation .
it will give me great pleasure to support this excellent document .
that is why parliament doe well to draw a number of red line .
the aim can not be to create a market for healthcare service .
on this point , the report is perfectly in order .
the right and safety of patient must come first .
finally , i would like to wish john bowis a speedy recovery .
his experience show the importance of cooperation between eu member state .
i would urge member to read what that regulation now say .
healthcare must be left up to the member state .
i find the legal basis a very difficult point .
i consider it unfortunate that article 95 ha been chosen for this purpose .
the committee on legal affair also gave that advice .
this issue is a priority for all member state .
it is a directive designed for patient and about patient .
neither can we grant the right to unlimited travel for patient .
accordingly , we feel it is essential to alter the legal basis .
i will end by wishing mr bowis a speedy recovery .
his case prof that cross-border service are already functioning without this directive .
the litmus test of this directive is it legal basis .
the right to health should form the legal basis .
in this regard , commissioner vassiliou , the commission proposal is excellent .
it would seem that new iron curtain are to be put up .
this proposal regarding patient mobility thus come none too soon .
we have all been waiting a long time for it .
i hope that the euregion can serve a an example in this regard .
first , there should be no forced health tourism .
secondly , there must be some minimum quality guarantee .
in the meantime government have lost further case with their citizen .
hospital in the czech republic already have to do this .
you social democrat want to force people to request prior authorisation .
so that you will be able to say 'no ' , of course !
the truth is that you opposed this proposal from the outset .
you have tried to restrict , impede and ruin it .
you do not even know how you will vote today .
you do not even know what you will be voting for .
i will be voting for the focus to be on the patient .
we have not achieved a much a we would like .
this being so , the rapporteur ha done an excellent job .
healthcare is not a commodity , it is a social right .
eu legislation must not put these system of solidarity in jeopardy .
that is why we intend to reject this commission proposal .
for me , that kind of guarantee is absolutely crucial .
( sv ) mr president , commissioner , at last !
the commissioner and mr bowis have done an excellent job .
i am pleased that we have got this far , commissioner .
we now have the opportunity in this house to take up our responsibility .
the discussion between the council and the european parliament will continue .
indeed , this is an important and most valid point .
we have codified this in article 8 ( 3 ) .
we all know that patient mobility will remain a very limited phenomenon .
this mean that it budgetary impact will also be limited .
therefore , there is no need to construct unnecessary barrier for patient .
such administrative mechanism run the risk of being both cumbersome and arbitrary .
i am concerned at the suggestion regarding the definition of hospital care .
regarding the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation , i simply can not agree .
however , the issue of organ allocation is a different matter .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
the cost will be paid by the country of origin .
it show the commission is blindly pursuing it discredited and obsolete liberalisation agenda .
i am pleased to see this confirmed in the text .
public money is leaking into service abroad for the rich .
that is why i can not support the adoption of the directive .
the european commission figure on this issue are , moreover , very worrying .
the system will ensure immunity of course , in order to encourage reporting .
health-care-associated infection are a specific example of a very common adverse event .
clearly , we must strive to improve significantly this situation .
we therefore need to collect detailed data in order to address healthcare-associated infection .
( et ) open health care is a primary benefit and right .
in this area , i support the rapporteur 's recommendation in this report .
this proposal can play a big part in achieving this goal .
i would like to thank them for the proposal they are making .
that is the added value of the european union .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
an important aspect in combating rare disease is patient mobility .
i await your debate with a great deal of interest .
this is why patient need more coordination , more safety and more clarity .
the same applies to the development of new drug .
the commission 's initiative , commissioner , is also very important .
genetic counselling , likewise , should not be dominated by a political goal .
i would like to draw your attention to three matter .
first , patient must have a voice in europe .
there remain , of course , the question of the timetable and funding .
various option are available , and we are exploring them .
one option that is working well in many member state is public-private partnership .
the selection of embryo would represent an opening of the ethical floodgate .
amendment 15 must therefore be rejected in it entirety .
the matter at hand here , after all , is healing people .
who is to decide which life is worth living ?
there are no specific recommendation and definite deadline for implementation .
funding for the treatment of rare disease is for member state to consider .
the commission agrees with the importance of patient ' group .
we work closely with them and in particular with eurordis .
that engagement of citizen is a vital part of work in this area .
the vote will take place in a few minute .
2007 discharge : european centre for disease prevention and control (
2007 discharge : european monitoring centre for drug and drug addiction (
2007 discharge : translation centre for the body of the european union (
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
i put a question to the president of parliament on 19 march .
i would very much like to support what mr cohn-bendit said .
( de ) mr president , of course we can continue the debate .
the simple solution is for the other 399 member to do the same .
i would like to suggest a common sense solution to this situation .
common rule for access to the international road haulage market ( recast ) (
otherwise we have to vote on the corresponding part of amendment 60 .
thank you mr ţicău , we take due note of your observation .
- before the vote on amendment 109 and 124 :
right of passenger when travelling by sea and inland waterway (
yes , you are correct mr jarzembowski : amendment 12 fall .
could the rapporteur , mr albertini , give u his opinion ?
thank you very much for the advice , mr alvaro .
of course , it is obvious that you have no experience of this .
otherwise , we would have to decide now without sufficient information .
i would encourage other colleague to put the patient first .
mr mcmillan-scott , up until now we have accommodated the speaker .
2007 discharge : european network and information security agency ( enisa ) (
2007 discharge : european foundation for the improvement of living and working condition (
2007 discharge : european agency for safety and health at work (
in other word , this parliament is far cheaper to operate per citizen .
however , that doe not mean we must rest on our laurel .
i would call on the member state to reconsider that decision .
the gentleman 's agreement wa never intended to apply to executive function .
( et ) i truly have a lot of comment .
this step will help ensure clarity and reduce bureaucracy .
for these reason , i voted in favour of the report .
this is the last opportunity to deal with and pas this directive .
'this land of such dear soul , this dear dear land [ ... ]
but then listen to his description of the lisbon treaty or european constitution :
of envious neptune , is now bound in with shame ,
i wa unaware that you possessed such a talent for rhapsody .
it is quite right for u to be talking about energy efficiency .
however , in taking that lead , we have to show moral leadership .
that is the precise opposite of medicine - it is murder .
the european commission did not start freezing this money until 2008 .
all this ha to be blamed on the pre-accession process .
the european parliament pension fund is a voluntary pension fund .
it is irresponsible to expect european taxpayer to pay for these loss .
we expect these decision to be taken before the end of april 2009 .
that applies to their income , pension and expense .
i am therefore pleased that parliament ha granted it approval to this report .
a a member i pay into a pension fund .
however , i do not see this a a conflict of interest .
a an mep i uphold the citizen ' interest before my own .
this proposal clarifies the rule on becoming a road transport operator .
the price and reliability of energy supply are critical factor in eu competitiveness .
however , we chose to vote against the report by mr gauzès today .
this question wa not raised in the report in a satisfactory manner .
he ha again shown his quality a a negotiator .
it is fortunate that a compromise could be reached quickly on this text .
the chosen solution , therefore , ha my full approval .
i did however choose to vote against the report by mr gauzès today .
this question wa not raised in the report in a satisfactory manner .
this is only one example of the failing of this report .
however , this only treat the symptom , not the cause .
in writing . - ( it ) thank you , mr president .
it is an important step towards equal right for all passenger .
however , creating this freedom of movement is not enough in itself .
otherwise we will fail both the passenger and the operator .
however , there are many reservation to be made .
i fully agree that many artist benefit too little from their work .
talented musician are being short-changed by the current system .
38 000 performer asked for our support to redress this discrimination .
this is about the equalisation of right for ordinary working musician .
i regret that there have been many false claim about this legislation .
all our attention is focused on two other reason .
the duchoň report wa intended to abolish the priority for passenger transport .
voter will soon realise that this deterioration in service is thanks to europe .
it is good that the text ha been toned down in this respect .
however , unfortunately , the majority did not agree with our position .
however , the sovereignty of the member state must be retained .
our high quality and safety standard in germany must not be compromised .
healthcare is and must remain the responsibility of the member state .
however , the issue of pre-authorisation is of concern to me .
prior authorisation in this directive negates patient ' right .
by including pre-authorisation in this directive , we are back where we started .
in writing . - the key amendment on prior authorisation failed .
for these reason i abstained in the final vote .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
it is a direct way of providing benefit to you .
this is particular true of rare genetic disease that are hereditary .
the vvd considers that the audit system in these area must be improved .
progress over the past five year ha been too slight .
despite some progress , there are still gap in this process .
consequently , the pd-l group in the european parliament voted against the report .
i dispute the notion that the eu can bestow and regulate fundamental right .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
climate and energy package and maritime transport package ( signature of act )
that is the result of intensive work lasting over three year .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the eu played a very significant role through it proposal and attitude .
i will begin with a flashback to the year 1933 .
recovery must not be at the expense of our child and grandchild .
we must not give up these advantage at any price .
however , a number of question remain open after the g20 summit .
it therefore remains to be seen how serious the commitment is this time .
this issue is no simpler today than it wa then .
i firmly believe that it ha a decent chance .
trade protectionism is a potential threat in any global recession .
decisive action wa also agreed on non-cooperative offshore tax haven .
this recession demand a coordinated response at international level .
that is the only way that we can all come out of it .
we must however be vigilant and not be tempted by easy solution .
we absolutely must lay the ghost of protectionism to rest .
they want supposedly to protect job by closing off our economy .
it is a social market economy that we need .
investor must know that the same standard apply throughout the world .
finally , we also have a responsibility towards the developing country .
it is the developing country that will receive most of this money .
i have here the very latest prognosis from the imf .
let u be fair and let u create the job .
we have significant experience in managing such complicated process .
movement and new job only appear when structural change take place .
what structural change can the european union offer the world ?
i always find it difficult to understand why we are not doing this .
this is particularly crucial because solidarity is extremely important in difficult time .
the worst is not behind u , it is in front of u .
now , the imf put the figure at usd 4 000 billion .
this grim reality underline the importance of my second question .
in truth , the g20 did nothing to stop liberal globalisation .
it ignored the key question of reorganising the international monetary system .
it drew a veil over the immense social challenge created by this crisis .
it prescribed homeopathic remedy where major surgery is obviously needed .
europe , i think , must go far beyond the g20 .
do you hear the cry of anger rising up from our society ?
several call are being made on the european union .
we are spokesman , through the commission , for this continent .
this may be an opportunity , but it may also be a weakness .
however , it wa a starting point , not an end point .
a yet we have no indication that this will happen .
look at the reaction to hedge fund , for example .
( de ) mr president , i can follow on seamlessly here .
they must draw conclusion from that and first learn what they did wrong .
clearly , in this respect , the g20 wa incompetent .
we call on you , commissioner , to explain .
what we need to do now is make this a reality .
this is proposed for country which have currency board .
a black , a grey and a white list were also drawn up .
mr rasmussen and mr starkevičiūttalked of pouring money into the economy .
i would like to voice my disagreement with mr lucas .
therefore the treatment must be long-term a well and it will require patience .
mr wurtz criticised the superficiality of the financial market agreement .
however , i would again make a call for realism .
the world economy is in trouble and the cure will be very long-term .
therefore we have to be very alert and vigilant .
this is a very important part of the reform of the financial market .
a mr daul said , we need more , not le , trade .
doha would boost the world economy and prevent protectionism from picking up .
the vote will take place on friday , 24 april 2009 .
you perhaps know that czech prime minister mirek topolánek also visited kishinev yesterday .
moldova must not diverge from the path of democracy .
linking up with the eastern partnership project should strengthen moldova on this path .
the remaining vote were shared between the three opposition party .
the international election observer criticised the moldovan authority in this respect .
following the protest pressure increased sharply on the independent medium .
some foreign journalist were expelled or prevented from entering the country .
there is a further very serious reason for concern .
during the crisis the moldovan authority committed serious violation of human right .
he also called for a transparent and proper investigation of the event .
it is essential to find a political solution to this crisis .
moldova is facing very serious economic problem arising from the global financial crisis .
there is an urgent need for a functioning government .
external assistance will also be required , including considerable imf involvement .
the situation in the republic of moldova is indeed of great concern .
the current crisis is a test over moldova 's resolve in this regard .
we are fully aware of moldova 's european aspiration .
in other word , we care for moldova and it citizen .
the accusation levelled against the romanian state by the moldovan authority are nonsense .
the head of state change , but the citizen remain .
the forthcoming european parliament ad hoc mission to moldova is very important .
we can not accept that , since european integration mean open dialogue .
it may be that commissioner ferrero-waldner 's instinctive optimism prof misplaced .
if so , what action will the commission take ?
president băsescu 's announcement on passport also added to tension .
president voronin and his comrade must commit to that cause .
prominent person in moldovan society are asking for an explanation .
therefore the problem we have to cope with is a european problem .
it is not a mere internal or a single member state problem .
on the contrary , it contained a great deal of criticism .
i therefore urge you all to support this resolution .
the final type concern the method for conducting the election .
we have a huge volume of specific data on this indicating election rigging .
the opposition party maintain that rigging ha altered the result by 10-15 % .
this happens probably when the road to chişinău pass through moscow .
unfortunately , the press encountered problem in reporting information about how event unfolded .
i feel that the situation in the republic of moldova is extremely serious .
the republic of moldova is a european country through it history and geography .
the region i come from adjoins the republic of moldova and ukraine .
it should be obvious why this analogy is not valid .
justice is the basis on which reconciliation can be built .
however , fulfilling the criterion for eu accession demand considerable effort .
it mean developing a consensual approach and being prepared to make far-reaching change .
this is not something that can be achieved overnight .
the priority of the european partnership are also clear .
the 5+2 list is not just another catalogue of supplementary term and condition .
however , initiative at a political level require broader support .
the role of the medium in particular should be more constructive .
lady and gentleman , i remain grateful to you for this support .
stability in kosovo wa maintained throughout last year 's important development .
there have been call for consolidation of the european union .
in this context , i very much welcome mr ibrisagic 's report .
the accession negotiation with croatia have , until recently , been going well .
this is a bilateral issue which ha de facto become a european problem .
however , the key priority for reform should not be forgotten .
also , the implementation of the saa interim agreement is broadly on track .
nationalist rhetoric is still very present , creating unnecessary political tension .
this autumn , the commission will present a study to this effect .
internal development is stagnating and european business are staying away .
the ethnic division in bosnia and herzegovina ha deepened .
the road map for visa liberalisation must be completed .
good report have again been produced here and will have broad support .
the commissioner said that you need to be realistic in the commission .
thirdly , what the minister said is also very important .
the people in the country need to do their own work .
a doris pack said , the political force must resolve their own problem .
mr president , there is no question of u approving such a report .
kosovo is the symbol of this enterprise of political break-up .
it is , however , history that will judge all of that .
patience in all matter is a virtue , not least in foreign policy .
the balkan ' natural vocation is to join the european union .
i cite a proof these issue , among others , of bilateral conflict .
the first is the disunity of the european union .
i expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future .
the balkan ha been and always will be a european region .
we are prepared to continue providing assistance in this unavoidably long process .
it represents a significant step away from dependency for bosnia and herzegovina .
bosnia and herzegovina simply can not be allowed to remain behind .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 2009 .
no other issue is more crucial to security in the 21st century .
negotiation at the npt review conference in 2005 were a disaster .
we european must demonstrate now that we are serious about disarmament .
we can do it , if we force the issue .
the council will definitely study the recommendation contained in the report carefully .
we believe the review conference can succeed only through a balanced approach .
these problem come mainly from north korea , iran and syria .
we are determined to play a key role in this important area .
at the same time we must deal with the nuclear energy issue .
the report correctly emphasis the importance of ratifying the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty .
all of this is happening in a special context .
this is not the time for timidity or hesitation .
of course , u leadership on this issue is welcome .
after all , the u and russia are the undisputed global nuclear hegemon .
i hope the house can support the pse amendment .
where it will end in iran , i can not say today .
unfortunately , not even the npt ha been able to prevent that .
i believe that we should latch on to that .
i would like to thank everyone who spoke here for their comment .
that is why i appeal to you once again .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 2009 .
indeed , seven member state have already done so .
i am delighted to see that parliament can endorse both proposal .
i count on u working together towards this common goal .
education , anti-discrimination and the right to work must be secured .
we must now do all we can to make it a reality .
until now , disabled person have been refused equal access to education .
only 15 % of disabled child are integrated into the school system .
our support for ratification this week should make clear three point .
it wa set up by the czech national council for person with disability .
the vote will take place on friday 24 april 2009 .
paradoxically , this mp ha a friend who is disabled .
disabled people are not happy with right which they only have on paper .
the next item is question time ( b6-0227/09 ) .
madam president , may i thank the minister for his reply .
where would we be without the european central bank ?
i should be obliged if you would answer first .
lady and gentleman , i will answer the question .
i firmly believe that only then will we achieve real democratic progress .
could the council do something to put an end to this vicious circle ?
double taxation is something for which there is no social justification whatsoever .
therefore smes are more burdened by these complicated tax system .
subject : outcome of the spring council on financing a global climate deal
i should like to thank the czech presidency for a fulsome response .
i am intrigued to know that you had the answer in advance .
all of this will be based on actual proposal from the commission .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.10 and resumed at 21.00 . )
however , we need to give the industry the right signal .
sometimes even small step can lead to big achievement .
i will pas it on to the bureau after this sitting .
the problem we face in term of resource use go beyond energy .
the problem is the overall pressure on ecosystem and the natural resource base .
this problem is getting worse because of growing economy and population .
the fact is that the current growth model and concept is not sustainable .
the eco-design directive , in my opinion , doe offer a way forward .
sooner rather than later we will have to address resource efficiency .
a i said , all this could have been covered by the directive .
other continent are often more innovative than the european union .
japan is highly innovative , partly through it 'top runner ' approach .
this is good for the environment a well a for the economy .
made in europe should indeed stand for the most environmentally friendly product .
another regrettable example of the directive on ecodesign is energy labelling .
fellow member , this revision can not , unfortunately , solve everything .
hopefully , the evaluation will provide an opportunity for improvement .
it is important that the directive on ecodesign be thoroughly evaluated soon .
doe it really bring about the innovation we are seeking ?
doe it reduce waste and the use of natural resource ?
i think that would be the wrong way to go .
another important mean at our disposal is the energy labelling of equipment .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
ecodesign relates to the first stage in a product 's life cycle .
harmonised condition for the marketing of construction product ( debate )
i will now set out what we were trying to achieve .
there is no way that the commission would support such an idea .
finally , i will deal with ce-marking and the abolition of national labelling .
that is directly opposed to the main goal of the proposal .
for understandable reason i have not gone into every amendment .
it is a very important measure in a very important industry .
instead they represent a barrier to the internal market .
i thank the rapporteur for her support in this regard .
we need a much stronger european internal market in this respect .
the first is the question of the regulation governing product claim .
annex 6 , in my view , go too far .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
that is why we think the threshold of 90 % is more reasonable .
amendment will be tabled to this end tomorrow in plenary .
the european union receives around eur 20 billion from vat revenue .
the liability period for vat at the national level ha not been harmonised .
importer who commit fraud must be dealt with quickly .
the proposed amendment , however , could negatively affect this delicate balance .
this includes in particular presenting a proposal to amend this provision when necessary .
mr hamon 's report on the saving tax directive is excellent and balanced .
it address the prevention of tax evasion and greater transparency .
let u go back to the root of the problem .
what are we finding after several year of operation ?
withholding tax , on the other hand , show many virtue .
we hope that the proposal will be supported and yield it expected result .
otherwise , we risk imposing a further harmful burden on business .
i hope that we will vote in favour of these report tomorrow .
however , that is not our main problem today .
focussing on this is a way of escaping our responsibility .
why do we find ourselves in the situation we are in now ?
it is just a matter of increasing the risk .
they get to buy chateau in france or play golf in spain .
moreover , none of the player have any incentive to prevent this development .
i think that that is not really the point .
the eu first need to reach a unanimous agreement internally .
a zero tolerance policy must be applied to tax haven .
the reform is an attempt to address these problem .
it is far more difficult to include other new product .
there is much concern about the victimisation of rom people in this way .
besides concern regarding legitimacy , i strongly question the effectiveness of profiling .
counterterrorism effort focus the spotlight on asian , especially those of pakistani origin .
thirty-two per cent of british muslim report being subject to discrimination at airport .
however , this angle ha to be properly assessed .
it is subject to supervision by independent public authority .
this kind of profiling is a waste of resource .
it doe not catch terrorist ; it doe not catch criminal .
kathalijne buitenweg can not be here , but i will represent her view .
i must begin by asking : what is a terrorist ?
we can see that it is neither efficient nor legal .
the carter center in the u ha showed it wa not efficient .
the german surveillance scheme on 18-40-year-old muslim men in germany wa not efficient .
so we are talking here about effectiveness a well a civil liberty .
the parliamentary delegation , too , wa a strong group .
that wa an important request by the socialist group in the european parliament .
it is a question of give and take , however .
i must say that i am very grateful to the shadow rapporteur .
those two text would be nothing without this one , however .
this regulation is , in fact , the enforcer for the other two .
we have studied the non-agricultural commercial us of pesticide .
for the moment , any assessment of their volume can only be intuitive .
rapporteur . - ( nl ) i think that everything ha been said .
( the president declared the sitting closed at 11.05 p.m . )
all of our institution have a responsibility concerning the monitoring of eu law .
this principle is foundational to the process of integration .
having the knowledge and the mean is not everything .
it also confirms it desire to find solution a quickly a possible .
there are many specific point raised in the draft report under discussion today .
in english this is called the single euro payment area .
on the other hand , the document revealed certain deficiency .
for this reason it wa decided that it should be revised .
the document before u is an improved version of regulation no 2560 .
parliament and the commission have declared that a strict deadline would be set .
the number of e-money institution differs remarkably from one member state to another .
the committee on economic and monetary affair would certainly have preferred le .
i can therefore say that i am fully satisfied with the result achieved .
the compromise offer an opportunity for a timely , adequate assessment .
we reduce information cost by having a common currency .
the price that we pay for this is to have more unstable economy .
this document creates exactly the right condition for all this .
we have opened the door for e-money only a bit wider .
all in all , this is a very cautious step forward .
user and merchant will be clamouring for more choice .
however , this must not lead to a reduction in official control .
it is therefore important for operator handling by-product to be subject to approval .
the particular operator that will require approval are clearly regulated .
it is now clear that good hunting practice is crucial .
game gathered in the wood must not be used .
this will eliminate legal uncertainty and resolve many shortcoming and difficulty .
too many rule in the new regulation are implemented using the comitology procedure .
i believe that we are on the right path here .
the commission therefore give it definite support to the common position .
let me give some example of what i am talking about .
it is permitted to use certain category 1 material in pet food .
we will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here .
i believe that we are on the right path here .
in this respect , we definitely need our researcher to choose an approach .
by and large , then , this is a good regulation .
( the sitting wa suspended at 10.15 and resumed at 10.50 . )
the international community can not allow this to go on .
i agree entirely with what ana maria gomes ha just said .
the first argument is self-protection for the world outside of afghanistan .
this is , therefore , about the self-interest of other state .
it wa the intention to free them from coercion and backwardness .
europe should refuse to lend any more support to this situation .
we must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of woman .
the highest child mortality rate in the world seemed to be improving .
unfortunately , however , very little ha happened in the last five year .
we must put a stop to this new shia family law .
this must be said loud and clear to mr karzai !
access to water is hindered because of the deployment of landmines .
all too often the mother have simply been murdered .
we should strive to resolve this problem , in spite of cultural difference .
fortunately , this law ha not yet come into force .
a woman 's dignity is intrinsic to her person .
young woman must be able to make decision freely and autonomously .
we can not accept the current situation in afghanistan .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
the un 's special court for sierra leone is unable to function .
the resolution is right to draw attention to these option .
they organised one of the most cruel rebel movement of modern time .
i therefore urge the commission to support it , financially , of course .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
for iraqi , iran can not be wished away . it is there .
people in ashraf are there on a volunteer basis .
the intention of our motion is to protect these people .
the life of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote .
it relates to the dispute over the mujahedin or the mko .
i would like to say a few thing about it .
all access to the international press or medium is prohibited .
now the foreign troop are preparing to withdraw from iraq .
inside iraq there is much solidarity with the iranian in exile .
later on , they were screened by the usa .
every one of them wa interviewed , outside ashraf .
they were encouraged and urged to leave the camp or go to iran .
since then iraqi force have started a siege around the camp .
dear colleague , this is the business of iraq .
the amendment tabled here in this house are profoundly mistaken .
( fr ) i am now going to speak in french .
international humanitarian standard should be applied , not least the principle of non-return .
i asked the president a question on 19 march .
today is 24 april . i have had no answer .
i think it is absolutely despicable the way the president is behaving .
mr titley , i will of course pas on your request .
( the minute of the previous sitting were approved )
mr martin , all of that will be verified .
un convention on the right of person with disability (
a member ha made a very serious allegation about voting in the chamber .
i have just said that it will be verified .
optional protocol to the un convention on the right of person with disability (
we adopted this report by consensus in the committee .
madam president , i would just like to make two brief comment .
the translation may give rise to confusion in the different language .
facility providing mid-term financial assistance for member state ' balance of payment (
taxation of saving income in the form of interest payment (
we only managed 387 of the 395 vote cast .
facility providing mid-term financial assistance for member state ' balance of payment
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
let u now proceed to the explanation of vote .
it is therefore on the record . it wa false .
if you please , i have recorded everything that you have said .
i have recorded what you have said , mr beazley .
i just wanted to put on record my complete support for this resolution .
it is time to put the battle for energy efficiency at the forefront .
i hope that this will set a precedent for other area .
last night he told me : 'i want to know that french people ...
the resident of camp ashraf are protected person under the geneva convention .
this is a question of the most basic respect for human right .
we therefore hope that this resolution will bear fruit .
finally , i have one point to make about the iranian regime .
that is why the greek communist party voted against the report .
that is why i voted in favour of the report .
the same applies to the importing of product from third country .
we need to step up our control in this regard .
existing law provides a sufficient level of protection in this regard .
however , it must be complied with and monitored .
the disparate requirement of the 27 member state will no longer apply .
harmonisation is not necessary for prototype and one-off product .
i appreciate the czech presidency 's support for this version .
in writing . - ( it ) thank you , madam president .
food safety and consumer protection in the eu will thus be reinforced .
this applies , in particular , to value added tax .
the eu ha a long-term ambition to reduce the regulatory burden .
material made of particle which measure le than 10-9 m are called nanomaterials .
uncontrolled release of free nanoparticles into the environment may be hazardous to health .
naturally , we will not make any progress in this way .
no longer are there solitary power , independent economy or dispensable globalised country .
that is the problem to which no solution is being given .
several key aspect are important to be acted on .
also , credit rating agency are now going to be regulated .
in writing . - ( nl ) i voted against this report .
until then , this period of stagnation will persist .
i welcome president obama 's initiative in this regard .

written declaration included in the register ( rule 116 ) : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
( the sitting wa closed at 1.15 p.m . )
i declare resumed the session suspended on friday 24 april 2009 .
this enlargement wa followed in 2007 by the accession of romania and bulgaria .
it significance for the everyday life of our citizen ha continued to increase .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
we remember the victim and express our condolence to their relative .
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
it is not a question of ratifying the treaty of lisbon here today .
we only want to be prepared for when it is ratified .
if it is not , then everything we have decided will be wasted .
it would be really irresponsible of u not to be prepared .
on behalf of your colleague mr kaufmann , i must disagree with you .
we discussed it in committee , during the meeting of 30 april .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
it ha initiated a new european policy - the baltic sea strategy .
here i am repeating the message delivered by my colleague mr bushill-matthews .
this is a matter which should be considered in the next parliamentary term .
this is not only the effect of the crisis .
( interjection from the floor : 'from her majesty 's prison ! ' )
israel 's behaviour is an affront to humanity , to civilisation .
debate in poland is dominated by squabble between two party .
they must be properly disposed of and handled according to the instruction .
i believe that we are making a fundamental mistake .
company which are growing and expanding have a future .
this activity ha started affecting an ever-increasing number of european citizen too .
the well-being of europe 's business is down to employee .
she understood the solution wa small government , individual freedom and national self-determination .
the eu is a 50-year-old attempted answer to a 200-year-old problem .
i urge you to write to the commissioner to take some action .
i have always tried to allow a many people to speak a possible .
the next item is a statement by the commission on the flu epidemic .
the ecdc operates the surveillance network which follow the number of case reported .
the commission ha worked throughout in close contact and cooperation with the who .
but we should not focus unduly on the negative aspect of these event .
europe mean solidarity in standing together to face this threat .
the second issue that i want to mention is that of antiviral drug .
an obligation wa introduced for the member state to have an adequate quota .
the minister met to exchange information , and plan were made .
what measure have been taken , and are these actually coordinated ?
it is hard to do anything with this council .
yet i agree with mr trakatellis and mr maaten .
we did hold an extensive debate in this house in june 2006 .
information on the nature of the virus is protected , is kept secret .
we can not tolerate this ; the threat is really too great .
there can be no solution within the framework of a single country .
i believe a great deal more information is needed .
it is well known that virus do not like high temperature .
those are all of the question that i am wondering about .
the same go for the medication available , of course .
certain member have said that there is insufficient information .
i also do not wish to always make europe responsible for everything .
it is the member state that are responsible for providing this information .
then we would be at the same stage a the commission is now .
i would like to express my thanks for this rapid and excellent work .
many speaker mentioned antiviral and the sufficiency of stock .
why table amendment that are vague and legally unsound ?
i call on the alde group to withdraw these amendment .
it is therefore unacceptable for woman to be penalised because they are mother .
the commission therefore reject the amendment relating to paternity leave .
in actual fact , many member state have already been applying this principle .
that is why the commission doe not recommend that these amendment be approved .
this significant principle ha been established by the european court of justice .
therefore , the commission can not accept amendment 68 .
it is likewise essential to improve the status of assisting spouse .
however , this particular amendment pose some specific problem .
the increase from six to twelve month is therefore simply good sense .
this issue is not just about woman ; it is also about society .
it is time for the commission and parliament to take up this issue .
i do not think that paternity leave ha a place in this directive .
breastfeeding a child is very important for it immunity and biological health .
however , the proposed change is still not sufficient .
i would also like to draw attention to two problem .
we should aim to introduce remuneration for caring for child .
an accompanying feature is the absence of social insurance for these people .
we are all obviously aware of the current demographic crisis .
( et ) mr president , commissioner , lady and gentleman .
however , there is a lack of political will .
delay and inadequate enforcement are common in member state .
in the end , i can go along with 20 week .
my second point concern parental , paternity and adoption leave .
after all , this directive concern health and safety and not parental leave .
i think that mr lulling ha done an excellent job on this .
it is particularly important that father are included in bringing up child .
this is what will strengthen the role of the family .
europe ha laid down minimum standard for maternity leave .
in certain country , maternity leave is paid out of tax revenue .
company will employ fewer woman , a men do not take maternity leave .
it is not enough to say that we defend these right .
however , we must be realistic because well-intentioned proposal can sometimes create problem .
i hope that these amendment proposal will be passed in the vote .
i think it is unnecessary to mention all of the proposal .
so there are tool other than the directive , in my view .
this mean that a new obligation will now be introduced .
in my view , this is a typical example of upward harmonisation .
but partner should be entitled to it at their request .
i am very surprised at this position , commissioner .
we have to give our citizen reason to go out and vote .
a a result , commissioner , we must adopt legislation that help them .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 6 may at 12 noon .
this proposal wa not accepted a the basis for a genuine compromise .
not even a suggestion of an end to the opt-out wa accepted .
the council wa not prepared to accept this restriction .
of these , 24 were concluded at the third reading following successful conciliation .
this demonstrates clearly that there is a culture of cooperation between the institution .
however , the meps in the negotiating committee were deaf to these proposal .
the council wanted to prevent this but parliament ha ruled otherwise .
the reality is that both party are at fault .
the two side of industry should have been involved .
this is not true ; they are fooling themselves .
the council did not want to put an end to the opt-out .
so please stop saying thing that are not true .
it took away doctor ' right and it took away their working condition .
it is an honour to listen to citizen and worker .
indeed , that is what the council also proposed .
it is important for flexibility , for the worker and the employer alike .
i wa pleased that there wa movement from the council on that .
he ha stabbed the social democrat in the back .
they do thing their own way , including the way they work .
this wa even recognised by the presidency during the negotiation .
it is regrettable that agreement will not be reached .
i can also tell you that we made some progress during the negotiation .
the reason we did not reach agreement wa the opt-out .
the council wa not willing to accept even this .
fortunately , the large majority in the european parliament said no .
the worrying thing is the subject of that extremism .
the responsibility for the failure therefore lie fairly and squarely with the council .
they , however , remembered what certain meps have forgotten .
parliament made all the running ; it made all the compromise proposal .
that is the reality of the use of the opt-out .
this mean that in practice freedom of choice doe not exist .
in practice this is , therefore , stealing the employee 's time .
i would like to respond briefly to some of the initiative .
can you see this mobile phone , can you see these computer ?
the council proposed restriction both on monitoring and on the introduction of opt-outs .
the council agreed to this but it wa still not passed .
they do not want more and more regulation and obligation imposed on them .
a directive wa approved in 1993 which accepted the exception .
the ruling ha it own logic and it is quite comprehensible to me .
the commission , for it part , is ready and waiting .
i would like to make it clear that we did receive this information .
i would not like anyone to go away with this impression of bias .
in writing . - ( hu ) madam president , lady and gentleman .
it is clear that certain worker claim to be self-employed but are not .
firstly , that working time must not be confused with driving time .
a far a the latter is concerned , the situation ha changed radically .
tomorrow afternoon , we shall be voting on the report by mr panayotopoulos-cassiotou .
i am grateful that commissioner tajani can support them .
the paper intimate that self-employed driver work 86-hour week .
nor doe the paper 's argument about road safety hold water .
i trust that common sense will prevail during the vote .
in any case , how would compliance with such a regulation be monitored ?
it is vitally important to aid employment and entrepreneurship during an economic crisis .
including them in the new directive will actually destroy their entrepreneurial drive .
there is no similar kind of regulation in any other sector .
adopting such a decision would have an adverse impact on the european economy .
the definition of night work is also of great practical significance .
i strongly urge you to vote in favour of this .
forty thousand people die every year on the road of the european union .
large number of people are injured or permanently disabled .
the main cause are speed , overtiredness and alcohol .
this directive is a move towards ensuring that driver do not become overtired .
we need to reject this proposal from the commission .
i think we should not confuse working time with driving time .
we shall not achieve this by raising obstacle to work .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 2009 .
in some area saving have already been identified and improvement proposed .
i wa promised close cooperation on rationalising european institution budget .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 2009 .
but what we have not done here is to regulate hunting .
this file ha been , for me , a conundrum .
after our exchange of view , we were all in tear .
it will apply both to product produced here and to imported product .
these product are traded on various market , including the community market .
the third element is the exemption for small-scale hunting .
i can also remember the opinion of the legal adviser to parliament .
both these adviser informed u that the legal basis used wa wrong .
personally , i think they are absolutely right in this respect .
the european union is virtually declaring war on our canadian friend .
i hope that my fellow member realise exactly what they are doing .
i just want to pick up on some of the crucial issue .
first of all , this is a call for action .
the canadian government ha to reflect on that a well .
the usa ha had a ban for many year .
this is a political issue that now ha it time .
a clear majority of canadian do not support their country 's hunt .
i know that this will be applauded by the citizen of europe .
indeed , i think this is the message sent out by this compromise .
once again i would like to emphasise this very clearly .
we can not want to import this abomination into the eu .
however , we should make a distinction between hunting and slaughter .
seal hunting occurs in sweden , but it is controlled protective hunting .
no club or cudgel are used ; gun are used instead .
the compromise that ha now been proposed is better than the original motion .
this is not only gruesome but also totally senseless .
monitoring capacity are insufficient , and often the government concerned are unwilling .
i am delighted with the result achieved , therefore .
this proposal destroys people 's life and their community in remote region .
with this ban we are failing in both area .
for thirty year we have attempted to control and to regulate this hunting .
this ha not been achieved in either norway or canada .
the rule are not complied with out on the ice .
consequently , what is being done here is a disaster for greenland .
a positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty .
however , i need an assurance from the commissioner .
perhaps i could ask a direct question through the chair to the commissioner .
the issue is whether they are killed humanely or not .
so there we are : we will see what the vote brings tomorrow .
the vote will take place on tuesday 5 may 2009 .
lady and gentleman , i endorse the wallis report .
we should not ban the hunt traditionally conducted by inuit community .
now we have the opportunity to end that suffering .
protection of animal used for scientific purpose ( debate )
animal testing is a highly controversial area and involves a moral dilemma .
from an animal welfare perspective it is a step forward .
it is also a step forward for medical research .
many million of life have been saved or improved a a result .
we have a good compromise in the agri committee .
i am certain that the dialogue which ensues will be constructive .
a a result , there are different level of protection in europe .
the proposal is also based on a carefully substantiated impact assessment .
moreover , numerous scientific agency made a significant contribution to this procedure .
furthermore , our proposal make provision for measure to minimise the administrative burden .
on the contrary , the two concept are interconnected .
these provision are the fundamental objective of the review .
we know that this is the case from the public reaction .
these test have been restricted to life-threatening illness and brain disease .
this is an indefensible situation for u in europe .
however , it is a pity that article 15 ha not got through .
we must provide a set of value , because that is our job .
we must not lose sight of the objective of the proposal .
this is about protecting laboratory animal and not about business profit .
i think that the proposed compulsory ethical review is progress .
member state must take their own ethical decision on this .
the commission 's ultimate aim is to abolish animal testing completely .
let u particularly make sure that this research is not relocated outside europe .
i would like to thank you all for this outcome .
allow me to formulate some brief comment on certain amendment .
concern wa also expressed about the criterion for severity band .
we are right to have this review of this legislation .
it is right to refine , reduce and replace animal testing wherever possible .
both industry and animal welfare organisation believe this is necessary .
a lot of technical expertise and work ha been put into this report .
we have put serious work into it and we have good compromise .
so i would urge all member to support it .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 5 may 2009 ) .
the european union should be working towards this goal .
unfortunately , the subject is always largely ignored in the interim .
we would like to congratulate him warmly on his work .
until now the civil liability legislation ha simply not been dissuasive enough .
it is much cheaper to discharge something illegally into the sea .
we can only protect our ocean by mean of dissuasive criminal sanction .
i too would like to congratulate mr de grandes pascual .
obviously , maritime transport is unfortunately responsible for some of this pollution .
unfortunately , the marpol 73/78 convention wa not enforced adequately either .
the most important thing of all is how effectively they are enforced .
this is why , above all , attention must be focused on monitoring .
i would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 5 may 2009 ) .
we appreciate the drive to improve consumer ' right in the internal market .
we need to be clear in our final proposal .
if so , what doe the consumer get in return ?
we will not spare our effort for this to happen .
we need this directive for the internal market of the 21st century .
the table will be available by the end of may at the latest .
the proposal complement the unfair commercial practice directive ( ucp ) .
i hope we will be able to move that forward .
in short , commissioner , you have been rather hasty .
( sv ) there is currently room for improvement in consumer protection regulation .
we need full harmonisation in the area of consumer protection .
i fully realise that the european economy is a service economy .
we will spare no effort to make everything clear .
thank you , once again , for the last comment , mr cederschiöld .
you are right to say that we are negotiating the directive .
consumer organisation in slovakia receive eur 152 000 to fund their activity .
the european consumer centre and the europa diary can also help consumer considerably .
recommendation to the european commission in complaint 185/2005/elb ( short presentation )
secondly , because of it obligation to support the ombudsman .
our opinion wa that our position would be recognised by the ombudsman .
this approach also support an active policy of training of young conference interpreter .
thank you , commissioner , thank you , colleague .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 5 may 2009 ) .
( the sitting wa opened at 9.05 a.m . )
a you heard , four rapporteur have been working on element of it .
there are substantial improvement that parliament ha made in this second reading .
there will be plenty of briefing about that afterwards .
they are important for consumer because they offer better service at fairer price .
i would like to express particular thanks for the effort it ha made .
i welcome the endorsement for the mandatory notification of personal data breach .
i have to make two declaration in response to point raised by parliamentarian .
the other document on the table is the gsm directive .
all this together is a very good package in the interest of europe .
you yourself were often present during the trialogue negotiation .
by we , i mean young people , who communicate worldwide .
what doe the telecom package achieve in this respect ?
the risk in building the new network have been distributed satisfactorily and fairly .
in the package we advocate a more flexible frequency policy in europe .
this will be a good breakthrough , especially for the new member state .
no one in this house ever wanted to restrict freedom on the internet .
thing will perhaps be better in one member state than in another .
i think that it is a very , very badly worded compromise .
what we are seeing today is the growth of a new society .
it is about interaction , freedom of expression , creativity and creative zest .
we have seen this approach before - in china .
it merely provides for widespread policing of the activity of internet user .
it includes no specific proposal to improve the legal supply of cultural good .
the final text is very clear on this matter .
we need judicial control before net access is blocked .
are we going to remain silent and not answer ?
information given to consumer in contract alone is not sufficient .
the telecommunication industry is one of europe 's leading dynamic industry .
we already decided earlier on that information is a civil right .
we do not know what prime minister brown got in return .
it is the sort of thing we condemn when it happens in china .
soon it should also be easier for people with disability .
they must be ensured unimpeded access to mean of telecommunication .
these people often say that the internet is a lawless area .
the internet is a wonderful tool for exercising one 's fundamental right .
some people believe that administrative management is the solution .
that tell u how much importance they attach to fundamental right .
this is the voice of europe , the voice of the electorate .
these are practical matter that are important to the individual consumer .
i think that both goal have been successfully achieved .
of course , there are also a few delicate matter .
in my view , this is an essential principle which must be observed .
yet i fear that i still have difficulty with the package .
nevertheless , i have a problem with this package .
i have to say i find this extremely irritating .
this is an essential condition for my support for this package .
i hope that parliament life up to this reputation during tomorrow 's vote .
i think , in fact i am convinced , ...
this is therefore only a first step in anticipation of other regulation .
this project will provide citizen with extraordinary access to information and culture .
i think that this project represents a considerable advance .
it is one of the basic sector for european economic power .
my congratulation to the rapporteur and to the commission .
this is actually an extremely important package for the european union 's citizen .
but i would like to stress that the internet offer huge opportunity .
i am just sorry that 'must carry ' ha been rejected .
the internet must apply the law in this field a in others .
that is why i share mr trautmann 's point of view .
this is something that sometimes involves examining data traffic .
therefore , it is important that operator are able to manage their network .
we are just trying to achieve the right balance .
( sv ) thank you very much , madam president .
i am sorry that i am a bit late .
this is indeed the magic formula for finding the right balance here .
we do not want the sort of situation there is in china .
of course , website can not be closed at random for political reason .
this is not a point that can be negotiated here .
we want a judicial reservation , a judicial decision on fundamental right .
allow me to answer some of the question which have been raised .
a second element concern a more open and neutral internet for consumer .
we have been shackling the thing that people have done .
let u move on from here and look towards the future .
this revision of the telecommunication legislative framework ha three immediate implication .
thank you very much , the joint debate is now closed .
i would like the council to stand up and explain it opposition .
i believe that thousand of european want to know why .
energy labelling and standard product information ( recast ) ( debate )
i shall comment on just two issue which have caused serious confrontation .
there are , however , two point that i must strongly oppose .
the european union ha proposed to cut energy consumption by 20 % .
therefore the proposal to use minus is much simpler and clearer .
we need a system which also encourages manufacturer to invest in eco-design .
we can do without it , the information on the label is enough .
i have followed labelling legislation for the last 15 year .
what is in the labelling directive from the beginning of the 1990s ?
it obstructed the updating at the end of the 1990s .
mr reul is always on the side of the industry lobby .
i am therefore hardly surprised that he is defending this .
member of the commission . - madam president , it is difficult .
that is what the commission is trying to do .
the second wa about the eco-design measure for fridge and tv set .
the report doe not at this stage give a complete solution .
this is the best way , and we should promote it .
i should like to make two very brief comment .
first of all , a regard the burning issue of energy labelling .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
defence of the immunity and privilege of aldo patriciello (
defence of the immunity and privilege of umberto bossi (
public access to european parliament , council and commission document (
a dialogue mean that each institution ha to listen .
so far , neither of the institution is listening to parliament .
i am not sure whether congratulation are in order for mr cashman .
organisation of the working time of person performing mobile road transport activity (
this is an abuse of the parliamentary independence of individual member !
all are example of the benefit of animal research .
we should put our party difference aside and support this report .
i urge member of the house to support this report .
energy labelling and standard product information ( recast ) (
parliament 's estimate of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2010 (
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
mr president , i am grateful to you for calling me .
mr president , i welcome the adoption of this report .
this is a very important signal that parliament ha sent .
we must now , however , follow it up .
mr president , this report presented me with something of a dilemma .
there is something not strictly rational about singling out seal for special treatment .
they are not an endangered specie - even the wwf say so .
animal testing should be a thing of the past .
funding for non-animal testing alternative must not dry up .
the commission 's good draft should have demanded more backing in parliament .
we have protected the seal and this is good .
that company ha shown that it is possible to develop alternative that work .
they believe there should be greater protection for animal used for scientific purpose .
how much doe this parliament cost , and can it justify it cost ?
yet , despite that , we manage to provide value for money .
my concern with this report is that it is a missed opportunity .
it should be noted that this proposal doe not affect the community budget .
i voted for the proposal on the marketing of poultrymeat .
a indeed we must also do in the case of gmos .
for the above reason , we have voted against the report in question .
i voted for the report on petrol vapour recovery .
the present regulation no 1049/2001 wa a significant step towards greater openness .
transparency is a fundamental principle of the european union .
the aim of this initiative is therefore to make these improvement .
not even the current presidency think this is worth the effort .
the idea of including self-employed people in the working time directive is unrealistic .
it is simply impossible to control the working hour of self-employed people .
the commission should review this , but ha yet to introduce a proposal .
i hope that the new parliament will take up these proposal .
in any case , member state must assume sole responsibility in this area .
should we exclude all self-employed driver from this directive ?
the question remains open , because the problem is complex .
it is a victory for road safety and social europe .
there is no such regulation in any other sector .
small carrier and sole trader will be hardest hit .
this achievement demonstrates the power and importance of the worker ' fight .
we have all been appalled by the picture of canadian seal hunting .
ultimately consumer will decide if they want to buy seal product .
we should approach such matter in a more balanced and dispassionate way .
neither i nor the seal want u to be back here in 2034 .
the job related to this business can easily be reoriented .
therefore , we have been unable to support this proposal .
nonetheless , this initiative of meps deserves approval and support .
in my opinion , a total ban is the right approach .
for this reason , i have endorsed the report by mr wallis .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
finally , it is an economic and social nonsense .
the multinationals are demanding more and more profit from research .
the scope of this directive must , moreover , be extended .
the development of these alternative method requires a budget .
regulation ha not , therefore , curbed the success of this industry .
the control have even improved the standard of scientific practice .
in the end i decided to abstain on the final report .
the june list support measure to prevent pollution from ship .
however , we believe that criminal law is entirely a national matter .
we have therefore voted against it in the final vote .
it protects shipping capital from the imposition of sanction against it .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted in favour .
spending on renewable and other low-carbon industry could help stimulate the economy ' .
any advert must indicate energy consumption and energy saving .
i voted for the directive on the indication by labelling of energy consumption .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
preparation of the european council ( 18-19 june 2009 ) ( debate )
we already have one - the lisbon strategy for growth and employment .
we have recently reaffirmed the existing employment guideline and adopted country-specific recommendation .
there wa a summit yesterday between the eu and japan in prague .
all european of heart and conviction must be prepared to get involved .
parliament ha shown it determination to achieve concrete result for citizen .
it ha proved that it had an ambitious vision of our common future .
the legacy of these last five year is very important .
i am sure that this work will continue until the end of june .
this will be our guiding principle for the june european council .
we can not allow ourselves to slow down the pace of our effort .
we have to succeed for the sake of europe .
the european union need the benefit that this treaty will bring .
we have shown that strong and credible target are possible .
there is no point in beating about the bush .
the second volet , of course , is employment .
we will discus the employment summit in more detail later .
lady and gentleman , the public often complains that europe ha no face .
that would be a fantastic present for the 1 july , mr vondra .
the credibility of the european union is at stake .
for this i would like to offer you my sincere thanks .
we have no faith in mr mccreevy 's plan .
if you compare both paper , there is a huge difference .
mr nyrup rasmussen will express this clearly and articulately .
so we all have to do something about this .
the time ha come to make clear how we will proceed .
let him confirm his signature of the lisbon treaty .
proposal must be created that will return the economy to it previous state .
these proposal must be implemented immediately to restart the economy .
we naturally hope that you will extricate u from this prickly situation .
i believe that consistency is the european union 's true problem these day .
the leader of the european union can no longer evade their responsibility .
this is what the people of our country expect from u .
instead there will be a troika summit , which is far le ambitious .
this is not an overestimate of the situation ; rather the contrary .
it represents a significant challenge to the present single currency system .
a number of country are having very great problem with the euro .
you may have resigned , but you still have responsibility .
the economic downturn ha caused the socialist to show their true colour .
they believe politician should dictate how many hour you can work .
they believe trade union should prescribe your working condition .
in britain , 3 million people use the opt-out .
it business , worker and public service rely on that possibility .
leadership is about taking chance , taking risk and taking the lead .
will he publish such a programme , and what will it contain ?
these target are crucial to the success of economic restructuring .
diplomacy without financial resource is merely a useless gesture .
then you would have to negotiate the package of guarantee with ireland .
president-in-office of the council , could you also say something about this ?
on the campaign trail , the voter ask u outright .
we therefore need an environmentally compatible streamlining of transport policy .
only in this way can we achieve global environmental improvement .
madam president , allow me to add to what chairman leinen said .
the second matter which i would like to raise is civil dialogue .
they believe that europe will do this better than their own member state .
i would ask that this also be taken into consideration .
i would like to appeal very , very strongly for solidarity .
we particularly need the political will to respond to the current economic situation .
protectionism , nationalisation and fear of globalisation will not help u .
i want ireland to remain at the heart of decision-making in europe .
we can not have a european union that ignores that .
we are now certain that it is not sufficient .
the recovery plan is insufficient and ha no focus .
the presidency will meet with you here at the end of june .
some of the people may be different but the work continues .
on the senate , many of you were talking about tomorrow 's vote .
i am not calling on the german constitutional court .
i would not mix the eastern partnership with the challenge of employment .
now i would leave you with my personal testament .
however , i have not heard much about any of this yet today .
this crisis is affecting the united state , and indeed it began there .
it is affecting russia , japan , and even china .
however , i can not respond to this challenge at present .
the european budget is minimal in relation to the national budget .
i also believe that we must support the work that europe is doing .
that , in my opinion , is a huge challenge .
i am also against improper political divide in partisan term .
the truth is that we can only build europe through large political family .
the commission will continue to operate in this way .
i wa elected to the portuguese parliament at the age of 29 .
i have served a opposition leader and prime minister .
however , it is also thanks to the czech presidency .
this is why there is a choice to make here .
the council and commission statement on the preparation of the employment summit ,
the european commission will be represented by president barroso and commissioner špidla .
in the short term , skill increase both productivity and mobility .
the newly-unemployed should not be allowed to become long-term unemployed .
a need for incentive to actively seek employment can not be overlooked .
this is why we need to reduce the segmentation of our labour market .
it affect both family and individual , who are plunged into real difficulty .
unemployment is a local , national , but also european phenomenon .
however , we now urgently need to evaluate it impact on employment .
the european dimension is absolutely vital for two main reason .
secondly , europe really can change thing and make a contribution .
we can design the tool at our disposal for maximum efficiency .
the input of this parliament into that process ha been most valuable .
those who lose their job must be helped to find another one .
third , we must also work to boost opportunity for young people .
i know that this is a particular concern of this parliament .
finally , upgrading skill and matching labour market need .
your vote this week is excellent news ahead of the prague employment summit .
i want this summit to yield concrete , tangible result .
europe is not only an economic and political project .
president , lady and gentleman , so much effort , so little effect !
however , that would be the wrong conclusion altogether .
there is still enough room for future amendment and improvement .
this is particularly important when we are talking about trade agreement .
we also talk about minimum income in place where we really mean that .
social security system do not always respond to that very well .
we also agree concerning the issue around the inclusive labour market .
the european citizen have been demanding a strong social europe for year .
i hope that this will help to mobilise everyone on 7 june .
we in the committee on culture and education have contributed via this opinion .
adult education play a role here in developing these skill .
the content of education must correspond to vocational and practical requirement .
there is also a need to promote university-business cooperation .
it is important to encourage the member state on these point .
unfortunately , in social policy we can not do everything yet .
however , the treaty of lisbon is a great step forward .
several of the leader will not attend this meeting .
this will create job and it will create consumption .
mobility is important , a stated at the workshop in prague .
ha this regulation been correctly transposed into national law ?
often legislation doe not allow the regulation to be implemented .
many country have a minimum wage structure and i support that .
our committee wa right , but we must go further .
he want to know what he will do with his life tomorrow .
i would like to congratulate jean lambert , the rapporteur on that report .
a you know , it is something dear to my heart .
i am also pleased that my amendment on mandatory retirement age wa accepted .
this would take away from their reliance on benefit .
finally , a quick word on the european globalisation adjustment fund .
i am glad we have had a speedy conclusion on this .
the crisis is producing a series of group redundancy .
lack of work is the main cause of deep poverty .
poverty promotes social exclusion and restricts access to education and health care .
the social agenda ha significantly strengthened the social pillar .
buffer are no use : we need a radical change in policy .
madam president , i welcome the change to the european globalisation adjustment fund .
what happens to worker whose government will not apply ?
we must rid ourselves of that burden and implement the social agenda .
the commission ha put forward a modest social agenda in response to this .
mr silva peneda gave u various priority for what we must do .
these are the group who really need our help .
i am delighted we are having this key debate .
we will really miss you and be thinking of you .
madam president , no doubt he will be lobbying u too !
( de ) madam president , the european social model face great challenge .
here we should also bear in mind the competence of the member state .
labour market regulation and system vary greatly from one member state to another .
what level would the minimum wage be pegged at ?
i declare myself in favour of a social europe .
we need urgent action to retain viable job wherever possible .
on the contrary , we want the worker to decide for themselves .
this decision ha to be left up to the worker .
the european globalisation adjustment fund is one such example .
( et ) i also support the reorganisation of the globalisation fund .
so let me thank you for all your contribution .
i think nothing is going to be omitted or forgotten .
another question which wa raised wa that of cofinancing .
in order to facilitate this , we proposed a level of 75 % .
i think it should be stressed that our line is absolutely clear .
the egf is also part of the european social model .
he wa right to say , 'a stitch in time save nine ' .
it is a compromise which i and my colleague are very proud of .
that is quite clear , and that is not it purpose .
we do not need to have a summit for the sake of it .
at this stage of the debate , i want to make three comment .
finally , i would like to mention the social fund .
the vote will take place on wednesday 6 may 2009 .
rapidly rising unemployment ha become the core problem of the current financial crisis .
europe ha to take this opportunity to reduce unemployment .
the best way is to stimulate the creation of new job .
the key issue is supporting small and medium-sized business .
moreover , europe ha to invest in education , especially in life-long learning .
the social conflict arising from this are threatening existing european framework .
familiarisation with the actual legal situation is crucial to dispelling the groundless fear .
the next item is question time ( b6-0231/2009 ) .
this is entirely in line with international consensus on tax information exchange .
( e ) thank you very much for your answer , commissioner .
they affect , above all , the middle class .
they affect wealth creation and do not stimulate investment .
however , we must consider tax in conjunction with short-term stock profit .
this is also partly the answer on using tax policy for creating job .
on our initiative several warning device have been installed there .
subject : solar thermal electricity and the economic recovery plan
what other source of funding are available to the sector ?
this is the easiest way to respond to the security of gas supply .
for this reason we have not considered other eligible area .
i believe in solar thermal energy but we addressed the most urgent need .
what source are available to support the further evolution of solar thermal electricity ?
we have eur 2.35 billion for the year 2007-2013 .
second , it is one area where you can provide the tool .
renewable energy project , such a solar thermal electricity , are eligible .
so if the project are there they are very welcome .
we can also use fund from the european regional development fund .
so overall eligibility for these measure ha been increased .
thank you , commissioner , for a very full reply .
we did that in the case of belene and also of mochovce .
a a result , we can not take a regional approach .
it is a question of the cost , condition and time needed .
so , we can not go with a regional approach .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , lady and gentleman .
it is a good way to really mobilise citizen behind these initiative .
we are using all those instrument to support these initiative .
the european investment bank is very active in this process .
that is my answer to your very important question .
can any progress be reported with regard to completing the doha round ?
this is an important component that we should factor in .
canada ha one of the world 's highest level of internet piracy .
this is exacerbated by serious legislative and enforcement deficiency .
we are optimistic since we will have negotiation on an fta .
the commission is currently consulting on the best way forward .
however , we do need to be careful about detail and timing .
this plant is currently mothballed and the worker are on standby .
the most substantial barrier will be removed from day one of the agreement .
in the last few week we had intensive transatlantic contact on this issue .
subject : non-compliance by airline with regulation no . 261/2004
the commission ha planned another meeting for the 14th of this month .
this is one of the aim of my work a commissioner .
i said this at the time when my appointment wa approved by parliament .
i will be brief , a i realise there is very little time .
i can therefore assure you of my commitment a commissioner .
these have certainly been successful with regard to competition and transport policy .
this is the work that the commission ha attempted to support .
subject : rail artery for europe and the brenner base tunnel
the commission therefore wish to meet citizen ' expectation in practice .
the relevant finance protocol will be signed on 2 april of this year .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
these three heresy will be fatal to european wine-growing , particularly in france .
it increasingly seems to be acting a the shoehorn of globalisation .
this incoherent logic becomes clearly apparent on examining two set of figure .
this sum up the racket in the rosé market .
yesterday we successfully discovered that quality would in the future turn to quantity .
commissioner , it is vital to prohibit blending before 7 june .
madam president , what are they trying to make u swallow ?
a mixture of red and white wine in the guise of rosé ?
the european union market is starting to be targeted by these third-country blend .
the uk market is particularly dominated by wine from the united state .
it is well-known that traditional rosé ha a short shelf life .
commissioner , you can therefore do me the honour of not exaggerating .
we believe that mixing wine is not an oenological procedure .
rosé wine is produced through a special , very traditional oenological procedure .
'this is my blood ; drink it in remembrance of me ' .
if you blend blood , then you make contaminated blood .
having heard what you had to say , i am now angry .
that would be the last straw , in any case .
blended wine is not rosé ; it is a mixed white .
wine is a fermented product , not a mixed product .
we cited a our ground ageing and the economic cost .
we also adopted the addition of sugar to wine .
nor shall we have the courage to do so now .
i therefore implore that we get off the slippery slope of these decision .
you talk about opening up to the world market .
i sometimes wonder , who is guiding whom here ?
would that be possible in future for these low-grade wine ?
moreover , no one ha ever asked you to authorise this oenological practice .
on the contrary , suggestion have been put to you .
they told you that they did not want this .
therefore you can not say that no one ha suggested anything to you .
there is rosé wine , and there is something else .
moreover , indicating 'traditional rosé ' on the label is stupid .
we are not dealing with any old business here .
so we are on exactly the same wavelength here .
i therefore think we have taken a balanced approach on this issue .
we will have this discussion again in the regulatory committee .
this is all the more true given that this practice could mislead consumer .
i question calling a blend of different wine 'rosé wine ' .
the next item is the commission statement on democratic process in turkey .
there is no moral or ethical justification of this kind of horrible attack .
our thought are with the family of those who lost their life .
we condemn terrorism and support turkey in it fight against terrorism .
the pkk is on the eu list of terrorist organisation .
the commission can not interfere in ongoing legal case .
political pluralism is an integral part of any democracy .
this is also an integral part of any democracy .
we will continue to follow up closely the development of this case .
that is an essential part of the process of democratisation of turkey .
if it doe not , this situation will remain at a complete standstill .
what doe the commission intend to do about this ?
the fact is that arrest and search are taking place .
careful reporting ha an important role to play here .
important progress ha been made on the kurdish question .
my fellow member mr öger ha just said that turkey is a priority .
it is the first copenhagen criterion that is in question .
there are varying opinion a to how turkey ha developed .
you know that you can not watch youtube in turkey .
in the opinion of many observer , these problem have increased .
turkey is an important neighbour , an important , respected nato partner .
it is progress that turkey and armenia have agreed to improve mutual relation .
this brings me to my final comment , madam president .
at present in diyarbakir there are more than 185 minor in prison .
there are more than 207 proceeding against dtp mp .
such is my reading of the present democratic process in turkey .
otherwise there can be no real democratisation in turkey .
that should be clear to all of u here .
in this respect , there is a massive need for reform in turkey .
the situation of million of kurd is slow to improve .
cyprus is still under turkish military occupation , in defiance of international law .
we were absolutely wrong and have rapidly become desperately disappointed and frustrated .
the time ha now come to use the stick .
however , diplomacy and democracy are two different thing .
i have already mentioned the commission 's progress report .
once again i would like to ask the commission a specific question .
if no , why is it no longer concerned ?
if yes , what specific measure doe the commission intend to take ?
in my view , three principle are particularly important .
that is the critical yardstick of turkish progress towards the european union .
protection of animal at the time of killing ( debate )
mr president , our civilisation is a civilisation which us animal .
is it possible to protect an animal which we are going to kill ?
yes , it is possible , mainly by sparing it unnecessary suffering .
by protecting animal from inhuman treatment we protect our own humanity .
a conspicuous example is the question of ritual slaughter .
the committee on agriculture and rural development rejected this idea in amendment 64 .
the spirit of saint francis of assisi is present in this chamber .
may he also be present in the next parliamentary term .
the commission suggests that subsidiarity should be maintained in this area .
in slaughterhouse , official inspector perform food safety control , mainly on carcass .
they have little time and limited competence to ass animal welfare parameter .
where this ha been properly implemented , it ha provided good result .
this should therefore be extended to all eu slaughterhouse .
transparency , which mean proper reporting , is therefore essential .
i would very much welcome your support of the commission proposal .
in addition to that , 25 million fur-bearing animal are slaughtered .
this involves an enormous amount of suffering for the animal .
i urge you to vote in favour of amendment 124 .
this is the case , for example , in my country , sweden .
please vote against amendment 28 , a proposed by the rapporteur .
the report we are debating improves the commission proposal on fundamental issue .
that would be ridiculous : one centre for every region .
on religious slaughter , i think the commissioner is absolutely right .
i think the commission must make up it mind .
i think it is absolutely clear that this should happen .
also , when it come to labelling , i see no problem .
why should we not label animal a to how they have been slaughtered ?
the commission proposal introduces important innovation which i hope you can support .
i thank parliament and it rapporteur for their support .
i think we are on the right road to achieving this .
i am glad that there is approval for these proposal in this chamber .
the vote will take place on wednesday 6 may 2009 .
general revision of the rule of procedure ( debate )
this report is the fruit of a lot of work .
i welcome that amendment , and we have put it in my report .
so there are a lot of interesting thing in here .
that is a rather sensible improvement to our procedure .
this is a democratic procedure ending in a vote .
for our group , the most important point is , however , proportionality .
in our parliament , the committee have very strong role .
i would also like to commend amendment 68 concerning the recasting procedure .
clear rule ensure that everyone participating in the political process is treated equally .
i call upon the member to vote in favour of these amendment .
the socialist group in the european parliament will support this report .
we must also be more robust in our work around the world .
let u be honest , the advising committee had almost no chance .
we must therefore avoid mistake and be able to improve the text .
. - ( sv ) thank you , mr president .
schadenfreude is the only true joy , say the cynic .
for that matter , this sum up parliament 's problem .
i will have been a member for 20 year soon .
may i secondly confirm what ha been mentioned already .
there will be up to 10 minute of catch-the-eye possible for such occasion .
instead , group can table an alternative motion for resolution .
finally , the point where i disagree with some member .
this is not the same amendment that wa rejected in committee .
it is a different one , a different approach to the subject .
i had grave reservation about the amendment that wa submitted in the committee .
i am happy to support the one that ha been submitted to plenary .
it will be up to the house to decide .
the vote will take place on wednesday 6 may 2009 .
we have established the right to withdraw from a petition .
we have decided to extend this right to petition , too .
the true reform , however , lie with admissibility .
the same hold true if confidentiality is requested during discussion .
however , what about the treaty of lisbon should it be ratified ?
on the other hand , you can understand the subject committee .
i think that is a reasonable quid pro quo .
i really have no understanding of how she could reach such a conclusion .
it is actually a european popular petition , a different sort of right .
the representative of civil society have set great store by this .
i would like to make a few remark about his last report .
i would like to come back to three point very briefly .
mr president , i will try to answer my fellow member .
we simply opted to strengthen coordination in this scenario .
i will continue my linguistic explanation with mr botopoulos 's question .
this is currently the case for only four language .
you say that , in this case , conflict could still arise .
we have therefore made provision for a safeguard in any case .
the vote will take place on wednesday 6 may 2009 .
( the sitting wa opened at 9 a.m . )
we know that this is a very sensitive and old problem .
the council considered parliament 's proposal and incorporated them into this package .
the council simply wanted to slink past the budgetary condition and agreement .
we need more flexibility , more manoeuvrability in the multiannual budgetary procedure .
this ha been our common conviction since the crisis began last year .
we are confident that the project will be implemented a scheduled .
i will now turn to my subject : energy .
the package is also an example of solidarity within the european union .
in particular , the gas crisis needed a quick response .
the commission also take good note of the amendment .
it is very kind of you to mention this .
the proposal form part of the european economic recovery plan .
i would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur for her fine work .
let me also briefly mention project in the field of energy .
unfortunately , i have to add a sour note to the proceeding .
that certainly did not make our life very easy .
i do think , however , that you can live without u parliamentarian .
we have had month of sometimes intense negotiation with the eu council .
this outcome is very bad and it could have been avoided .
unfortunately , we have no brave and visionary commission president .
where , finally , is the highly proclaimed solidarity across the european union ?
re-injecting fund into an unrestrained economy is just throwing money down the drain .
after these opening remark , i have three comment to make .
secondly , there is no efficiency in a single electricity market .
over a large distance , energy loss is proportionate to the distance travelled .
it ha been a pleasure to work with you all .
farmer are naturally aware of their responsibility towards society .
the rural population are the most vulnerable victim of the economic crisis .
however , the order of priority raise doubt in my mind .
at the moment the money is unfortunately not there .
the commission is quite clearly planning to administer further euthanasia .
we need equivalent living condition in town and city and in the country .
however , rural area can not be kept alive through agricultural subsidy alone .
the demise of farming in recent year show this more clearly than ever .
subsidy for disadvantaged area must not be cut but increased .
it is very important that we deal with this 'five billion ' package .
especially when it come to smaller farm , you do need another income .
so i wish the commission well with the whole project .
parliament is ready to find any possible solution through regulatory mean .
moreover , the council still ha to agree to release these margin .
above all , there is not much left over for rural area .
now , a compensation is to be created with eur 100 million .
the package in itself is fine ; there is no question about that .
can the designated money flow into the designated project within the designated time ?
eur 5 billion over two year are an expression of european solidarity .
these resource are the driving force behind the european economy .
in 2007 we had galileo , which wa fairly easy to explain .
can the commission reassure u that it will not shirk these responsibility ?
so thank you , commissioner , for your accessibility and cooperation .
it is more of a shot in the arm than a therapy .
it is also a strange way of protecting community agriculture .
i would like to see more emphasis placed on youth unemployment .
we need to give the younger generation hope for the future .
the fact is that some of the issue remain unresolved .
and voter would surely count that against u come the next gas crisis .
that is positive and we must hold on to it .
farming need resource and it will still need resource after 2013 .
mr stavreva , thank you very much for your report .
the time ha now come for me to do something else .
this package is important because it boost our common market 's liquidity .
such a package is needed not a some sort of subsidy or aid .
( ro ) i too would like to congratulate our rapporteur .
cooperation between member state on energy issue ha been rather complicated .
it is also important to see this injection of money a a one-off .
so broadband is one of the issue for the future .
( de ) madam president , you overlooked me during the catch-the-eye procedure .
at least , it is assumed this will happen .
a sum of eur 3.5 billion ha been allocated for this .
not many job will be created immediately with that money .
the most important are the one which concern energy connection between network .
it is not the only body of law we are proposing .
it is an additional package , with which we are pointing the way .
we have also enhanced the balance between home and host regulator .
the second area is securitisation , the granting of loan .
the retention lead to transparency and also to better control .
nonetheless , there is still a lot to do .
i would like to single out pro-cyclicality a the fifth point .
we must resolve the crisis now and provide the resource now .
it ha been a pleasure to work with you all .
let me give you an example of a pleasing result of this cooperation .
the financial crisis ha demonstrated the need to further strengthen eu supervisory arrangement .
this is why the commission proposed to provide them with financial support .
the basel committee on banking supervision will follow suit .
let u just remind ourselves that bank are not risk free .
this is a crucial lesson of the financial crisis .
adequate diversification and collateral are critical to ensuring financial stability .
i understand this reluctance , but only for the current economic context .
the budget committee recognises the importance of these proposal and their urgency .
commissioner , i deplore the absence of the council presidency .
finally , you should have also decided to introduce guarantee for bank deposit .
you see , the regulatory holiday is not news .
we can only welcome this ; it is along the right line .
these are the very area where the credit crunch is biting hardest .
it ha followed this by demanding more resource for those committee .
funding should also be sought from the user-side such a investor .
we ought to consider whether this might not be part of the solution .
we have deposit guarantee for small-scale saver and even quite large-scale saver .
the regulatory system in basel ii wa circumvented by mean of shadow banking .
now we are talking about new rule for capital .
if this is more shadow banking , it is not going to help .
then we will discover that very little should be done at eu level .
this is a global problem and should be dealt with elsewhere .
it is a pity this did not happen three year earlier .
i am also in favour of stricter securitisation rule .
i would like to make a couple of remark .
i hope this will happen a soon a possible .
i would like to thank mr berès for her amendment to the proposal .
today , we are dealing with the second point .
i acknowledge that mr karas ha achieved many thing .
this wa the pressure of obtaining this hasty result .
moreover , we still have not decided who will pay .
will a special fund be set up at european level ?
the whole world , including european country , would suffer .
but this is only a first step in a very long process .
mr bowles made a pretty strong contribution in this regard .
so it is the percentage which is being debated .
i hope i have never given the impression that i did not .
it also highlighted the weakness and the need for further development .
in other word , the debate will continue , it ha to continue .
these are milestone that have naturally informed this work and also policy making .
i hope that there will then be a high turnout .
this is my last speech , a i have already said .
the vote will take place today , wednesday 6 may 2009 .
the presidency wa able to reject this immediately a incorrect .
it is an accusation of a serious criminal offence .
i see that mr hans-peter martin would like the floor .
i have the right to make a personal comment under rule 149 .
i absolutely reject what my fellow member ha just uttered .
but that is what the right wing extremist are like .
i have said that the matter ha been clarified .
your comment will be passed on to the bureau meeting this afternoon .
the request is outside the deadline , but if it is accepted ...
cfp : repeal of directive 83/515/eec and 11 obsolete decision (
amendment of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 may 2006 (
indication of the energy consumption of household refrigeration equipment (
when discussing this legislation we talked a lot about impact assessment .
we had a reform group that mr frassoni herself belonged to .
our committee complied with the conclusion of the reform group point by point .
i am therefore voting against the motion tabled by mr frassoni .
for many of you this will be your last week in strasbourg .
we all know that democracy gain strength through constant change .
together we have been able to achieve a great deal .
lady and gentleman , new member will soon revitalise the work of parliament .
they will join those who are re-elected in june .
one often hears that others are taking the lead in tackling climate change .
since 2002 , parliament ha called for better financial market supervision and regulation .
there is still a lot of work to do , however .
we are hoping for a positive outcome in the czech senate in prague .
together we have advanced parliamentary democracy in the european union and beyond .
the european parliament and national parliament are now partner .
now parliament also participates in the institutional and constitutional deliberation of the summit .
we are committed to the dignity of every human being .
it unites u in the community of shared value of the european union .
we must not allow these principle to be called into question .
the basic decision for establishing the house have already been taken .
the constituent meeting of the two oversight body were held yesterday .
you are worthy of our thanks , our support and our appreciation .
we have just had another meeting of the conference of president .
a bond of trust wa created , for which i am sincerely thankful .
it is a great privilege to be at the service of europe .
i wish you all the best for the future .
this meaning is the general interest of all european .
under your presidency , this parliament ha seen other major advance .
this is not the time to review your work .
you can agree or disagree with one thing or another .
i hope you will write about your experience and impression .
like you , this is my last plenary speech in my current role .
president , on behalf of my group , i thank you .
my group and i consider that you have fulfilled your duty with honour .
mr president , we have known each other for 30 year .
you just do not get it , do you ?
this is not the time to have that argument all over again .
you not only acted politely but also took corrective action when necessary .
is it not necessary to hold these candidate to account ?
electronic communication network , personal data and the protection of privacy (
this is very important for both the harbour and the trautmann report .
mr dahl , a far a i am aware there is no problem .
i see no problem with the voting order on the harbour report .
we will proceed a it is on the order paper .
all political party were heavily involved in these discussion .
if the vote is not reversed , the list stay the same .
body of european regulator for electronic communication ( berec ) and the office (
that is the consequence of the vote that is being taken today .
equal treatment between men and woman engaged in a self-employed capacity (
that is why this additional paragraph ha to be adopted .
i am also acting on mr cocilovo 's behalf in this matter .
i will therefore end by asking my fellow member to support my report .
these 89 amendment are all totally at odds with each other .
it is presumably supported by a majority in this house .
it wa also discussed with the commission and with the council .
i would suggest the following english text for paragraph 2 :
i therefore request that we keep to this order .
community programme for financial service , financial reporting and auditing (
voting against amendment 28 will preserve the possibility of this ban .
voting in favour of amendment 85 will eliminate this reduction of transport time .
i will read it ; it is just a few sentence :
i would just like to say something briefly about the swedish translation .
active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market (
i am conscious that our interpreter have been here for a long time .
there are so many that i do not think it would work .
the community budget can not be recycled using the flexibility mechanism .
i do not understand why we have ever had this bizarre rule .
maybe the 'father or mother ' of the house ha a logic .
a real exceptional act , the crime of a real political scoundrel !
from claude autant-lara to jean-marie le pen , we have come full circle .
the alternating order will begin with the oldest female member . '
personally , i have more confidence in the french electorate .
personal animosity must not be cited a backing for quasi 'knee-jerk legislation ' .
roll call vote increase meps ' accountability towards citizen .
the european parliament and the council have now agreed on a compromise .
this compromise doe not contain amendment 138 and 166 in their original form .
we therefore voted against the compromise in today 's vote .
afterwards , each can then lay the blame on the other person .
one month from the european election , that is a strong sign .
mr sarkozy and his friend in the 'majors ' have some respite .
the citizen , for their part , will have to remain alert .
internet user are customer , but they are also citizen .
however , we believe these decision are best determined by the member state .
this is not a problem , a many seem to think .
this is a positive thing , not least from a swedish perspective .
selfemployed people currently make up only 16 % of the working population .
barely one third of the 32.5 million self-employed are woman .
by putting people first we can build a fairer society .
i would once more like to underline the importance of our decision .
we have voted against the report a a whole .
however , the content ha become far too focussed on fossil fuel .
such project would be cost-effective and would reduce emission and create new job .
the 5 % retention agreed in the trialogue doe not meet this requirement .
this open the floodgate to unfair competition against public bank in germany .
the exceptional circumstance require u to take fast , appropriate action .
i can accept the result proposed to u in the area of securitisation .
the systematic introduction of standardised college of supervisor is a major advance .
i am delighted that these idea meet with general approval .
a for the scope , one thing must be said .
the latter would be directly subject to the new banking authority .
this vote is an excellent outcome for many reason .
mr karas can be satisfied with his work in the negotiation .
budget restrictiveness must remain a guiding principle for u a elected representative .
however , the present report lead u in a completely different direction .
every year in the european union , million of animal are killed .
this may sound paradoxical , but it is possible .
our law and custom are changing progressively to accommodate islamic sharia law .
school menu are drawn up to meet islamic dietary requirement .
public opinion is very sensitive and completely opposed to unnecessary , painful practice .
they are from another age and can be rightly termed barbaric .
in writing . - protecting animal from cruelty is a very important responsibility .
i particularly refer to the proposal to have all slaughter at slaughter facility .
this proposal also carry risk in term of contagious disease and infection .
however , the report also contains requirement for minimum wage system .
i voted for the silva peneda report on the renewed social agenda .
the social record of your europe is a resounding failure .
furthermore , we are just at the start of this profound crisis .
you add in flexibility , when this is merely eurospeak for 'insecurity ' .
this is a brazen expression of the arrogance of power !
we therefore voted against the report in the final vote .
europe must create a social framework and establish standard at a european level .
in this way , we pay due regard to the principle of subsidiarity .
however , the report also contains requirement for minimum wage system .
however , conservative do not support the concept of an eu discrimination directive .
we need to create more job and more capacity in our labour market .
british conservative are committed to accelerating that change of direction .
( the sitting wa suspended at 14.40 and resumed at 15.05 . )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
in fact the trend in a number of country is even negative .
the eu ha a strong acquis on the fight against racism and xenophobia .
the durban review conference wa part of those wider effort .
there are some who regard the durban review conference a a success .
why are 27 european country unable to agree on a strategy ?
the final statement wa delivered on behalf of 22 state .
thirdly , the report call for synergy between the community institution .
a significant part of your report is dedicated to this issue .
let me now say a few word on the eu guideline .
the eu-china human right dialogue is the longest-standing dialogue .
both of our institution are following closely development in china .
we look forward to seeing increasingly tangible result from these talk .
to achieve result , we have to adopt a consistent approach .
we are launching a pilot programme aimed at 10 country on different continent .
the communication ha been the subject of very broad consultation .
special attention is paid in it to nongovernmental organisation .
in 2009 , we are continuing down this path with the following initiative .
we will strive to bring together all the stakeholder .
i personally place a great deal of importance on this forum .
the commission is prepared to act along these line .
i speak about the amendment tabled by our alde colleague .
last but not least is the fight against terrorism and human right .
mentioning specific name in our resolution would be counterproductive .
he is quite right to say so , therefore .
human right are still somewhat the cinderella of european foreign policy .
i think that human right must be given a much higher priority .
i am thinking of the guideline on torture , for example .
madam president , i believe that the amendment is grotesque .
finally , i should like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent work .
thing look very bad for respect for human right in many country worldwide .
it is our understanding that human right are indivisible .
maybe we should start with attempt to 'de-schröderise ' europe .
on the eu-russia human right consultation , parliament 's conclusion is devastating .
the judiciary in criminal case ha been totally subordinated to state power .
it reacts rapidly and resolutely to the human tragedy all around the world .
it is often also the problem of value versus economic interest .
this would significantly ease relation between the eu and china .
we have a genuine interest in improving bilateral relation .
we will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demand on china .
it should genuinely tackle these human right and hold talk with u .
madam president , my congratulation to the rapporteur and to other colleague .
but this report ha to be more than just word in a document .
i think it is paragraph 48 that refers to the death penalty .
i consider it essential to keep article 84 and 96 in the report .
this man ha been given no health care in prison .
i think it is only right that this house should criticise it .
this is a small moment of joy in our presidency .
i believe we have to double our effort in reaching out to government .
this is a personal commitment that is very dear to my heart .
we know about the relationship between democracy and respect for human right .
i could have responded to more specific question about child .
perhaps i will have the chance to see you again .
it is not i who will be in the chair this time .
in writing . - ( hu ) mr president , lady and gentleman .
unfortunately , there are numerous current incidence of this within the eu too .
this is my last speech in this plenary session .
thank you very much , and goodbye for the last time .
asylum seeker , however , are not comparable to illegal immigrant .
i have studied the financial cost of my proposal on material assistance .
i must also thank the author of the amendment .
so those are certainly the two big issue at the moment .
i heartily thank the five rapporteur for their considerable and excellent work .
it ha to be said that a fruitful working relationship ha just begun .
a regard eurodac , i broadly agree with his proposal .
for the commission , however , there must be a reference indicator .
i thank mr masip hidalgo once again for his excellent presentation .
the amendment that change this approach can not receive our support .
some aspect of the support office issue should be commented on .
amendment restricting the support office 's mandate must be avoided .
the procedure proposed by these amendment could considerably delay the director 's appointment .
we do indeed need this office to be established quickly and effectively .
others , obviously , have invoked the principle of subsidiarity .
both the council and parliament favour the establishment of such an office .
may i therefore urge you to keep your promise !
that is a real shame in all sens of the word .
how do we get a reliable list of safe country of origin ?
what source are we going to use to produce such a list ?
why is it that we have not delegated practical cooperation to frontex ?
to me , that seems a very practical solution .
all asylum seeker should have fast access to the labour market .
i also consider it problematic to temporarily suspend transfer .
the socialist group support this report , but we have also tabled amendment .
there is no need to re-open that debate when we are discussing asylum .
i can not allow you to distort this proposal .
let me also comment on the principle of solidarity .
that is something on which i am confident we can all agree .
one of the speaker referred to effective legal protection .
clearly , effective legal protection is a fundamental principle .
this regime kept it citizen like they were in a large prison .
we look forward to seeing this coming into being .
we have , thank god , been able to find a solution .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 may 2009 .
the same go for the possibility of receiving maintenance payment .
clearly , these issue are real , serious and tragic .
why is it that the european institution have to deal with this problem ?
personally , mr president , i am not a great legal expert .
it is therefore clear that something more must be done .
obviously the commission is glad that compromise have been reached .
i believe that we are in full agreement on this matter .
i am delighted that your report fully support the principle of mutual recognition .
that really is the main ingredient of mutual recognition .
next , you mentioned the transposition of the new eurojust decision .
finally the report insists on the judicious use of new technology .
this is a scandal , and this scandal must stop .
this is a fundamental issue that i wished to introduce into this debate .
i hope they are going to change their mind in the future .
i must say that little ha been done in this direction .
mr president , i will not need two minute .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , at 12 noon .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
the next item is question time ( b6-0231/2009 ) .
the following question have been submitted to the council .
( e ) thank you very much for your answer , mr president .
if europe doe not protect creative work , we will not have them .
is the council aware of the responsibility that it bear at this time ?
the european council will further discus these issue at it june meeting .
you started your presidency with the reputation of being climate-sceptics .
now both the upper and lower house have voted to approve the ratification .
we have a job yet to do in ireland .
i am delighted with today 's result in your senate .
this is a great load off our mind and we are naturally overjoyed .
forecast of the conclusion of the negotiating process can not be made .
this is an important step forward for democracy in the country .
application from other country might be received at a later stage .
( de ) many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply .
second , will you name a date for macedonia this year ?
third , what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restriction ?
subject : protecting the most vulnerable in the economic crisis
allow me to tell you how much i appreciate this .
this possibility wa recognised by the european court of justice under certain condition .
however , it depends on the member state ' national policy .
we are bearing this in mind and we will take account of it .
the committee on constitutional affair wa therefore right to be optimistic .
vice-president , i thank you for always standing alongside u .
the treaty of lisbon strengthens and clarifies the institutional balance within the union .
that is why they tell the lie that they tell .
and it wa no meagre majority ; it wa 54:20 .
in this way , we can defend our interest in this world together .
there are many opportunity open to national parliament through their right of veto .
in this way , they are doubly legitimised democratically .
my main desire wa to defend the prerogative of the parliamentary institution .
first of all , modification to the primary legislation .
unfortunately , however , the decision on own resource remains with the council .
parliament is merely consulted , except on the method of application .
finally , the union 's new responsibility will create new funding requirement .
let me start by making a number of observation .
this is behaviour that is neither credible nor forward-looking .
in my report , the number 7 is proposed .
we now know that this idea ha been on ice for six year .
the time ha come for direct democracy in a united europe .
i admire very much your commitment and , could i say , perseverance .
a special thanks to those of you who will leave .
there are , however , a few area we should discus further .
if so requested , this practice must also apply to the special representative .
so national parliament are greatly affected by the change afoot .
however , pressurising ireland now would be a tremendous mistake .
parliament 's approval will also be required for all trade agreement concluded .
the citizen continually ask what the european union doe for them .
i think it is good that we will have the treaty of lisbon .
i am very pleased that the prague senate ha also ratified the treaty .
thank you for allowing u to demonstrate this once again today .
you all know that the czech republic 's view is critical yet realistic .
this mentality is clearly one of the reason why we are debating tonight .
it is one of the most sensitive area in the constitution .
it is the ultimate rule for our original coordination .
european people 's mutual commitment is truly the assumption of their common humanity .
this is an excellent idea and one that i can only welcome .
you have already thanked a few who are unfortunately no longer with u .
we have always been a committee with strong participation .
he fought for the constitution and also for the referendum in spain .
alain lamassoure ha achieved an enormous amount , including for the constitution .
the treaty is the logical response to these challenge .
it is the best treaty that can be agreed at this time .
now , we are all covered in scar and bedecked with decoration .
i am giving my last speech after 15 year .
allow me to , perhaps , take a look into the future .
we know what we all think of the progress made by this treaty .
and we have not yet come to the end of the road .
they were clearly thinking of the next hundred year .
in the meantime billion of euro will be spent into the next generation .
i think there is still a long way to go .
mr president , i am not giving up on my dream .
there are a number of regulation in this area .
there is 'permanent structured cooperation ' enabling a military core europe .
what we need is a new treaty for a new era .
the treaty wa voted against and is therefore dead .
all of a sudden there is going to be a second vote .
( sv ) i will now switch to my own language .
this is appalling and a disgrace to the eu .
we treat the aspiration of our electorate with outright contempt .
we are no better on the rule of law .
this is little le than a bloodless coup d'état .
so let the 450 million vote on the treaty .
the union will thus be ensuring that step are taken towards direct democracy .
the written text of a treaty is not enough .
that is precisely what today 's report are doing .
i recognise that the treaty of lisbon constitutes an improvement in certain area .
i know that the british conservative over there are not interested in that .
it remains their choice to do so or not .
there is a wider lesson to learn from this .
those eurosceptics over there only need one victory out of 27 .
they also quote referendum that have given a 'no ' result .
they never manage to mention the spanish referendum , the luxembourg referendum .
for five year i have been working closely with catherine guy-quint .
the two of u have been budget coordinator for our respective political group .
you are more no-nonsense than i am , but sometimes that is necessary !
this is described well and clearly in mr guy-quint 's report .
this would enable u always to help shape these framework .
that is not such a silly idea in essence .
we urgently need to focus on what the treaty is about .
we are getting new power in environmental protection and climate change .
a if a single nation state could solve these problem on it own !
i believe that the new supervisory power and procedure will strengthen this parliament .
it is becoming an awkward process drafting the budget .
it make one wonder who could have developed such a complicated system .
for parliament the new procedure will require a strengthening of available human resource .
it ha also demonstrated the strength of our commitment to take europe forward .
it seemed for a while that it might not happen .
it would be foolish of u not to do so .
we can not let the eurosceptics turn the clock back .
a really historic atmosphere prevails in this late-night session of parliament .
a ha been said , it is above all a more democratic system .
however , this is a system that still contains uncertainty .
will it enjoy this new power , given that there are also problem ?
we have le time ; there is only a single reading .
on this issue , too , we need to make an effort .
i trust he will accept the will of their parliament .
i understand it ha been referred to a judicial review .
i believe that the irish people know that the situation is different now .
perhaps the step that are being taken are not big enough .
it is a response to the changed need of the european union .
we can not create something new through pessimism and delaying tactic .
it is extraordinary to have listened to some of the contribution .
and all the speaker keep on saying that the parliament have ratified .
this will probably be the lowest in the entire european union .
the debate over europe , serious debate , doe not exist in poland .
there is no such response from the political class .
the statement that there is no-one here from that party is untrue .
mr president , thank you very much for giving me this opportunity .
when you talk about democratic accountability , let u not forget one thing .
i do not see that any other position would be possible .
all these thing are taken up by these important report .
that is the basis , also , for these report .
it is really about tackling these problem , which today are not national .
we never hear anything about that from those that are against .
it wa a major debate , an important debate .
today parliament in 26 country have said 'yes ' .
it is labelled with stereotype , sometimes also in this house .
it is the most social european treaty there ha ever been .
i would like to thank all my colleague for their support .
mr president , this debate ha been really interesting and passionate .
let u reclaim utopia , and utopia for peace !
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
the treaty will bring the eu closer to it citizen .
we will now proceed to today 's explanation of vote .
it is just that i did not react immediately .
rural area can implement project aimed at developing broadband internet link .
you might think that it is not my place to say this .
it objector do not even seem to have read the report .
hopefully we can correct that in the next parliament .
after all , member have a right to have their say .
regrettably , i felt compelled to vote against these european parliament proposal .
what we did in the harbour and trautmann report wa essentially to choose .
i would like to thank all those who sent u e-mail about this .
we need legal provision regulating individual ' right to use the internet .
these were the position that led me to support mr trautmann 's report .
the current system of domain name and registration work brilliantly .
i welcomed this decision , and supported the report .
local newsman kent brockman show up to report on the situation .
after all , i am forever in your debt .
working nine to five is not an option for all .
there is no 'return to sender ' for them .
fortunately my mistake did not change the final result of voting .
actually it started in the united state of america with the subprime problem .
secondly , i would ask the presidency to look again at the rule .
if we want to change that rule , then that is fine .
adoption of amendment 28 reveals the true , bloodthirsty face of this parliament .
this seems to me the best approach on this issue .
we have spoken extensively about flexibility in labour market policy .
mr oviir , your fan club ha stayed to the end .
( the sitting wa closed at 12.20 a.m . )
( the sitting wa opened at 9.05 a.m . )
medium mundus : audiovisual cooperation programme with professional from third country ( debate )
there are new opportunity , but also new challenge .
the medium mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response .
this is my last speech in the european parliament .
medium mundus will start in 2011 and will follow on from medium international .
that is also why we support the organisation of forum for international co-productions .
that is always a win-win situation for people from third country within europe .
that is where it saw the light of day , so to speak .
all in all , this is a project that help all side .
it help the third country and the european film industry .
there is huge potential here for enriching the job market .
for me , slumdog millionaire is an example of success .
she ha been an excellent colleague and medium expert .
thank you , mr hieronymi , and all the best .
this is , of course , a good concept .
this subject , however , lead u to reflect on something else .
therefore it is no surprise that it is losing .
however , we do not have to rend our garment .
initiative like the programme we are discussing are a small but necessary step .
because that is what move people in their heart and mind .
all the internet medium represent an unrestricted alternative to traditional mean of communication .
some of you know that you will be coming back .
it ha been enjoyable and pleasant working for you .
i also wish to finish by expressing my gratitude .
in fact , this programme is rooted in a policy .
a few year ago our film industry wa in the doldrums .
thank you , mr hieronymi , for all that you have done .
much still remains to be done to make artist truly mobile .
we should therefore support this sector , which is still in it infancy .
it is essential to promote european film in other country .
thanks to all those who have helped this to become a reality .
mr president , i thank you for the supportive and constructive debate .
on that note , i would like to thank you all .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
draft commission regulation on reach , a regard annex xvii ( debate )
there are two aim to our stimulus and our input .
the effect of asbestos on health have long been known .
the current economic crisis can not justify this extension .
the commission , for it part , is claiming the opposite .
could you shed some light on this point for u ?
why 'yes ' in some state and 'no ' in others ?
in this case , too , a good example ha not been set .
ten year have gone by and the death have continued .
we need to move on , however , to practical action and commitment .
asbestos is very often safe while it is covered .
i , too , would like to make a personal comment .
on a personal note , i would like to say two thing .
rest assured that we shall also miss you for your work and dedication .
the vote will take place today at 12 noon .
further reduction in asbestos in europe must be welcomed unreservedly .
common rule for the allocation of slot at community airport ( debate )
we do so with a great sense of responsibility .
thank you , mr costa , and congratulation on your fine work .
in light of this , i share mr costa 's concern .
the reality is that traffic is in continual decline .
i also understand that slot are not just about take-off and landing .
lowering the 80 % threshold to 75 % would not solve our problem .
that is precisely what they are doing - at the expense of passenger .

( ro ) the situation in the republic of moldova is now clear .
the key to democratisation in the republic of moldova still lie in moscow .
the european union must take action to reduce this influence .
in fact , history show u that these action must be vigorous .
the prüm treaty wa forced into european law without proper democratic scrutiny .
it much prefers to tell them how we feel what they should want .
however , many of u in this place simply do not care .
some people argue that the number do not work .
it will be giving up too much to give gibraltar a seat .

there are many moldovans who have applied for romanian nationality .
i voted for the annual report on human right in the world 2008 .
i do not understand the author of that amendment .
attacking the pope is only evidence of pre-election cynicism and harmful radicalism .
an independent foreign policy is essential for maintaining national sovereignty .

she wa on hunger strike for at least two week .
that , too , is part of our message .
over the last five year , we have had many debate on iran .
moreover , opposition activity within iran can result in detention .
quite rightly , this parliament ha recently spoken out against these two practice .
her health and her life are still in danger .
we appeal for her to be given a fair trial .
we know that for five week she wa denied access to a lawyer .
we condemn the iranian revolutionary court 's unfounded decision on roxana saberi .
this time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of roxana saberi .
shame on them and shame on the brutal mullah .

furthermore , pressure from rebel forced the democratically elected president to leave madagascar .
that , and that alone , is what we need to resolve .
i should therefore like to welcome a delegation of mayor from this region .
madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively .
this unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation .

in reality they do this only for their own benefit .
the case of manuel rosales only confirms what i am saying .

i wish to work with all of you , regardless of political convention .
mario , i know how important for you human right are .
... which wa possible thanks to the lesson of john paul ii .
for me , human right will also be a priority .
you are in the best position to do this .
we in the group of the green will always support you in this .
i wish you every success in your new role !
i come from eastern germany and work near słubice .
słubice and frankfurt/oder are both part of a united europe .
andrzej wajda and other polish director are part of our european culture .
mr president , you have our respect and our support !
i think the sign for change here are not very good .
the future of european democracy rest very heavily on irish shoulder .
mr president , you fought against the soviet union .
european parliamentarianism ha always provided a forum for various opinion .
this is what discussion in europe is based on .
our institution must strengthen one another for the sake of the european project .
we are , in a way , dissident just a you once were .

action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
the lithuanian president had already refused to sign this law .
we proceed to a presentation of the order of business .
i will be in touch with you about this .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
please allow me to say a few word at the outset .
yesterday we inaugurated the seventh term of the european parliament .
we also had the election to the european parliament .
from now on i will eschew grand word and pathos .
we also passed muster concerning the measure adopted for stabilising the banking sector .
in this way it confirmed it ambition to be a strong global player .
during the czech presidency major progress wa achieved in restoring confidence .
the june european council confirmed the direction taken by the commission .
there wa ample confirmation of this during the course of the czech presidency .
this mainly involved a european perspective for the country of the western balkan .
i wish you every success for your term of office .
i should also like to highlight the political significance of this czech presidency .
i would also mention the review of the globalisation adjustment fund .
this will enable u to spearhead the reform of the international financial system .
the european project ha always been a long-term one .
we make progress when we work a a team .
however , i want to give a message to every european citizen .
on the plus side i would mention the energy policy referred to earlier .
i wish you every success over the next two and a half year .
prime minister , your predecessor did not have an easy or positive start .
despite the criticism , you were also successful in other area .
many people want to use the crisis to promote a new economic nationalism .
it fall in the middle of it presidential term wa unprecedented .
the whole of europe looked to prague in amazement .
he is a prime minister and a man who refuse to lie .
but it is when it come to ireland that i really get interested .
it is not worth the paper that it is written on .
of course you have been supported by mr barroso on that .
he say we must ignore them , we must continue .
i am of course referring to the visit of václav klaus .
( mr barroso placed a european flag on his desk .
on the contrary , it may even be better prepared .
criticism have been levelled here at the pace of financial market regulation .
i hope it will be final , decisive and correct .
i would like to congratulate you and all of u for that .
i believe that these talk will also be a success .
after all , solidarity is the greatest strength of the european union .
mr fischer , i regret to say that i do not agree .
however , more important is his failure to sign the treaty of lisbon .
it doe not change in any way the body or the substance .
the exact same treaty of lisbon that 53 % of the voter rejected .
we need a new treaty for a new era .
the truth is that we are paying the price for indecision .
however , i believe that we have a great opportunity .
others recall the controversial parliamentary speech of president klaus .
however , the czech presidency wa also connected with some definite progress .
the czech presidency had two face and symbolically it had two premier .
today the more successful of the two stand before you .
a an irish socialist , i challenge this coalition .
he did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in parliament .
moreover , this is what the treaty of lisbon provides for .
we share , of course , the same common european objective .
the treaty of lisbon contains a horizontal social clause .
it give u more social right and the charter of fundamental right .
i would like to thank you for your contribution to the discussion .
we were able to cooperate very closely on the day-to-day agenda .
once again , i wish you every success in your work .
( the sitting wa suspended at 10.35 and resumed at 10.40 )
free and unregulated movement of capital and the existence of offshore financial centre ;
presentation of the work programme of the swedish presidency ( debate )
collectively , you all give a voice to 500 million european .
we were richer economically - but poor in term of european community .
twenty year ago the barbed wire between austria and hungary wa cut .
the berlin wall came down , and europe changed almost overnight .
if you are a late starter , you need time to catch up .
in the late 1980s political commitment for europe began to mature in sweden .
slowly the realisation of sweden 's closeness to and dependence on europe grew .
he wa driven by a firm conviction that sweden belonged in europe .
eighteen year ago we made our application for membership of the european union .
it enabled me to see how european cooperation worked in practice .
this ha in turn had an effect on the swedish population .
nearly two in three swede believe that eu membership is good for sweden .
that is a victory for all of u who believe in european cooperation .
it temperature is rising - and it is up to u to react .
the greenland icecap is shrinking by more than 100 cubic kilometre every year .
the icecap in the western antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate .
the most vulnerable are those in bangladesh , eastern china and vietnam .
there would also be other serious consequence , however .
although time is short , it is still on our side .
if we consume le energy , we will save money .
this is where we must seek the answer where the climate is concerned .
twelve year ago a coalition of the willing wa formed in kyoto .
europe is crucial to getting others to join an international agreement .
all over the world we must set a price on emission .
we must start using national carbon tax and emission trading .
measure to increase energy efficiency will not become economically worthwhile .
the responsibility of the few must now become the responsibility of all .
i know that the european parliament will accept it responsibility .
in a global world , problem also spread quickly to others .
moreover , there is still much that can go wrong .
we agreed on guarantee and rule of the road for supporting the bank .
we agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy .
we are hoping for your help in achieving this quickly and conclusively .
otherwise , short-term imbalance will be followed by chronic deficit .
mass unemployment , social unrest and growing tax pressure then await u .
this is by far the best way to safeguard our welfare system .
in addition , we must activate and reactivate the unemployed .
the world outside the eu is not standing still .
the objective must be an eu that come out of this crisis stronger .
that is why the ratification of the treaty of lisbon is so central .
it is now time for the eu to look outwards and forward .
let u hope that that becomes a reality in the month ahead .
criminal network no longer see their activity bounded by national border .
we can see how the drug trade and human trafficking are spreading .
a flexible system for labour immigration could bring together these two reality .
otherwise we jeopardise our progress towards our aim of continued european integration .
the eu must work for peace , freedom , democracy and human right .
parliament presented a draft strategy for the region back in 2005 .
these day the world 's problem come knocking on the eu 's door .
let me tell you how i see the europe of the future .
i want to see a europe that take responsibility for the economy .
'lending for spending ' can not be the only motto .
such a europe will be strong whatever the time .
there are many challenge , and we must prepare for the unexpected .
many ask whether a country the size of sweden can shoulder this responsibility .
not alone - but together we can face these challenge .
let u do so with vision and drive , with initiative and courage .
the european project is about the dream of solving people 's problem together .
this year , 2009 , is a fateful year for european cooperation .
we have the chance to take the next step .
the swedish presidency is ready to take on the challenge .
getting the economy back on track remains the top priority .
you will have heard about the progress made at these meeting .
these are the headline priority - and rightly so .
during these last 50 year europe ha consistently exceeded expectation , confounding doubt .
it is a question of political will , mr reinfeldt , mr barroso .
job security is vital for the internal stability of society .
the law in force is the treaty of nice .
i would therefore like to state very clearly what we are expecting .
then you could have made a decision regarding formalisation .
you have experienced a crisis in the real estate sector .
the result is that there is no single approach .
mr barroso , what happened to your forceful intervention ?
finally , mr reinfeldt , i can say something positive .
you have said you will do this by the end of the year .
congratulation , and i wish you much success in your work .
this is the question of ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing .
those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis .
the european union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament .
asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy .
we must overcome the crisis of confidence that undoubtedly exists .
i know that a number of you were elected with very strong support .
it is important to be able to represent your respective group strongly .
let me say that we are putting job first .
we want to see a europe in which more people have work .
the discussion must start from how we achieve this .
how we manage financing and how we invest are important .
therefore i will do what i can in my role .
firstly , mr schulz 's important question regarding the treaty .
the treaty in force is the treaty of nice .
the task now is to gain the approval of the european parliament .
in any case , that is my position a regard institutional matter .
you can not ask germany and latvia to do the same thing .
with your support i believe we can achieve success at the copenhagen conference .
i would like to take this perspective one step further .
this is not only wrong , but also worrying .
trade union right must take precedence over free movement .
( fr ) mr president , we are faced with two issue .
it must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis .
( sv ) mr president , congratulation on your appointment .
you also have remarkably good rhetoric on climate change .
it is here that i find the concrete information lacking .
how are you going to deal with the ippc directive on industrial emission ?
how are you going to deal with illegal felling ?
the same applies to my hometown and the stockholm programme .
in your priority you discus the importance of the supervisory framework .
these industry are , a we all know , global industry .
the capital , the talent and the individual enterprise are highly fluid .
the economic crisis and the climate crisis were not predestined by fate .
the crisis have their origin in political decision made .
neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy .
i wish you luck and success in the challenge that you now face .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
however , it is very important to give clear signal .
however , the appropriate preparation must naturally be made by these country .
it ha already been said that you have our full support in this .
i believe that this is an important task for europe .
at the same time , unemployment is also rising .
the strength of the eu lie in it open border and free trade .
state subsidy to rescue the car industry are not the solution .
the internet wa an important issue in the election campaign .
the rule of law must also apply in the virtual world .
now is the time for political leadership and drive .
thank you , and a we say in my party : good luck !
prime minister reinfeldt , you spoke quite rightly of the climate crisis .
i would like , however , to draw attention to three challenge .
the need for diversification of energy source should also be mentioned .
i am sure that the swedish presidency will be equal to these challenge .
this say more about the swedish presidency than it say about the eu .
i am , of course , referring to the second referendum .
you have presented your programme and it is very ambitious .
thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval .
today the minister are meeting in stockholm to discus the stockholm programme .
furthermore , i believe that our work in strasbourg must be discontinued .
many proposal and new programme are being put forward .
we will have to take specific measure to implement these project .
the system is broken and must be deeply reformed .
we need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in december .
the issue of crime , home affair and justice truly concern u all .
we certainly need also coordinated support from the eu budget .
third , for estonia the stockholm programme is important .
it should also include a programme for using modern it .
( sv ) mr president , congratulation on your appointment .
the big group , the big company always get attention .
europe 's largest inland sea can and must be saved .
let them not distract you from your mission , your purpose .
i believe that we must concentrate on the essential .
allow me to point out just one issue , prime minister reinfeldt .
( hu ) in our view , sweden is synonymous with europe .
we will be looking to the presidency to implement three important priority .
the second priority is the implementation of the pact on immigration and asylum .
we must do our utmost to ensure it success .
i know that you are waiting for a vote .
a number of the minister in my cabinet are here with me today .
we have noted and carefully followed your question and view .
we also count on constant discussion and keeping in contact with the presidency .
i would also like to thank the president of the european commission .
this is not the appropriate response to the economic crisis .
there is a need for new policy for a new era .
there is a need for a new treaty for a new era .
the eu 's swedish presidency ha a huge responsibility towards it citizen .
sweden is renowned for it social policy and high standard of living .
election of quaestor of parliament ( first , second and third ballot )

the next item is the council and commission statement on iran .
the issue on our agenda at this time is iran .
we have been in constant touch with the iranian authority over these issue .
we should strive for engagement with iran at all level .
pressure on human right , yes , but no isolation !
we are going through a very difficult and tense period with iran .
well , sanction are one possible measure being explored .
we should stand up against that a we stand up against unfairness internationally .
iranian men and woman are tortured daily in these prison , too .
why are we not prepared to put tougher sanction in place ?
scrap it and let u start talking tough with the iranian authority .
it people alone have the right to decide on change to it society .
let me share with you a couple of fact .
( e ) mr president , lady and gentleman .
structured dialogue on human right ha been suspended since 2004 .
i call on the presidency of the council to do this .
we will not change the appalling behaviour of the dictator by word alone .
this regime ha no place in the 21st century .
we must demonstrate that we do not cooperate with dictatorship .
mr president , a crucial change ha taken place in iran .
they have demonstrated an amazing courage in challenging the dictatorship .
i would also like to express concern at iran 's nuclear programme .
however , i think that we must hold it within the right framework .
unfortunately , our group chairman have rejected a motion for a resolution .
i ask myself who we are actually paying attention to here .
anything else will be a waste of time and will prolong this disgrace .
first of all , the iranian regime is unpredictable .
i think we are united in what we say and what we think .
i think we must then operate along two line .
so we must condemn the killing , the use of the death sentence .
we must call for the release of those detained .
other factor will come in to that particular equation .
we have the nuclear dossier that ha been alluded to .
those are other issue that we need to engage on .
but do not think it is going to be easy .
τhe next item is the council and commission statement on china .
we also have the annual high-level dialogue on trade and economic issue .
we hope the situation can be resolved peacefully through dialogue without further bloodshed .
this can be seen again and again throughout china 's history .
the people 's republic claim that it doe not seek territorial expansion .
i saw this when i visited urumqi four year ago .
here , mr bildt , is a role for the european union .
however , this is not a conflict where the two side are equal .
the uighur are a suppressed people numbering only nine million .
the society is also not harmonious a the communist party of china claim .
i have one last very important comment to make to the swedish presidency .
we shall expect strong action from the swedish presidency in this regard .
the latter is not the only victim of totalitarian government , however .
of course violence by the uighur should be condemned too .
is it separatism if i am wrongfully imprisoned and i try to escape ?
do we have to bow to a power simply because it is larger ?
we , a the european union , therefore have an important obligation .
radio liberty and radio free europe were also previously based in munich .
that is what we social democrat are calling for .
i wa therefore very disappointed by what you said , mr bildt .
the problem started in a toy factory in guangdong and spread .
we live in a small world . we must live together .
supporting separatism anywhere in the world is against the spirit of the eu .
( hu ) the question is where do we stand on this issue ?
are we on the side of china or tiananmen square ?
are we on the side of china or tibet ?
are we on the side of china or the uighur region ?
are we on the side of 1.2 billion chinese or 8 million uighur ?
can a mother of 11 really be a terrorist ?
are we on the side of token autonomy or real autonomy ?
it is obvious to me whose side i am on .
i hope that it is clear to my fellow member too .
we must make friend with china so that it can learn from u .
we still have a huge amount of work to do .
a harmonious society is not simply the same a masking authoritarian relation .
when we talk about xinjiang the word 'uighurs ' should also be mentioned .
i would like to say one last thing to mr posselt .
so the vast majority of those killed were han chinese .
many of the local han chinese are also envious of them .
sometimes problem do not lie where they seem to at first glance .
we should be careful not to take a one-sided position .
we ought to support the chinese in solving their problem .
however , it is also showing the will to improve in many area .
mr bütikofer referred to the concept of a harmonious society .
we lament the bloody clash , the dead and wounded in xinjiang-uighur .
at the same time it is wrong to accuse china of cultural genocide .
china is an important partner for europe , alongside the u and russia .
the chinese government know that this conflict can not be solved with violence .
that action wa in violation of the constitutional order of honduras .
we do not have any diplomatic contact at the moment either .
after many year , latin america is again experiencing an institutional rupture .
but we trust that these negotiation can resume a soon a possible .
we will continue to keep parliament informed about any further development .
we now have to find a way out of this situation .
it seems to me that this is going to be a decisive week .
following the coup d'état , meeting planned last week have been cancelled .
the european commission ha to be very firm on this issue .
in that , of course , there is a condemnation of what happened .

i call for immediate reconsideration of the copenhagen agreement .
mr mitrova wa also given bulgarian citizenship early this year .

in my constituency of northern ireland , we know the pain of terrorism .
had it not been discovered , multiple loss of life would have occurred .
the european union is destroying democracy in it member state .
the eu is founded on misrepresentation , deceit and lie .
thank you and may god 's help be with u .
thank you , and thank you also for being concise .
we have an eu citizen being banned from travelling to another country .
this person 's freedom of movement is being restricted .
that is the position of the european council and the european commission .
now the camera have gone away , yet the economic siege continues .
at present , the producer price bear no relation to the consumer price .
this is about ensuring the security of europe 's food supply .
if we support mr barroso , nothing will change .
his family , who are my constituent , are convinced of his innocence .
i believe that this parliament should not take it eye off the ball .
then we would have a large arena to develop the world revolution . '
furthermore , this false optimism is also leading to the wrong solution .
moldova ha assumed the responsibility of committing to a pro-european course .
the european union 's responsibility is to facilitate it course on this path .
this subject is fraught with difficulty for all concerned .
twenty second for mr kelly , for a very brief rejoinder .
lady and gentleman , we have had 39 speech in 45 minute .
the eu treaty leaf no room for economic nationalism .
there are no figure in sight showing a recovery .
there are serious consequence for the entire supply industry .
mr langen , what do you consider to be a reasonable time ?
a i said , the process must be allowed to go ahead .
with interruption such a this , however , the debate becomes more interesting .
we are discussing how general motor in the u staggered on for month .
in any case , this should emerge clearly from the investigation .
i think that would be a better approach to take .
we have beginning , which is a very good thing , i think .
in theory , that mean modern , future-ready car .
who will build better bus , better train and better lorry in future ?
brussels can not just criticise germany or other government .
the global economic crisis ha affected many area of the economy .
financial protectionism on it own would simply extend the life of uncompetitive activity .
after all , often enough it is the same old story .
commissioner kroes , you have rightly promised an investigation .
commissioner kroes , you have a reputation a a woman of steel .
that is a scenario which it is still perfectly possible to avert .
everyone need to work together , and to do so quickly .
many people believe that the opel-vauxhall case is a german issue .
it is not - it is a european issue !
we do want to save every job , but at what price ?
the opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view .
it is always only the biggest who receive help .
the fixation on one investor wa clearly a wrong move .
it could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of germany .
he mentioned the globalisation fund , to which there have been seven application .
car are becoming safer and cleaner but are still blamed for everything .
for many people of modest mean , opel represents an affordable brand .
we must all take step to retain job in our home country .
my third point is that there are strict rule for state aid .
judged against the potential for environmental improvement , it record ha been shameful .
of course , there are positive story to be told .
huge sum of money have been put into propping up this industry .
i think we , the public , deserve a bit better .
we will not allow the commission to remain neutral for another second longer .
( e ) madam president , i thank the commissioner for their explanation .
this is therefore what we require of the commission for the future .
in this respect , i fully agree with what mr davy said .
mr luhan , you had a question for mr lope fontagné .
that is not a question for mr lope fontagné .
i wonder : what kind of industrial policy do we want for europe ?
european effort to counter the crisis must be coordinated and balanced .
there were other proposal on the table , such a a structured insolvency .
that is also what i hope for from the next commission .
several month later , this wa no longer an urgent topic .
i also want to touch upon the time schedule .
by the way , nationality wa never an issue in cooperation with bank .
we will go a fast a the provision of information allows u .
we need to be sure and be in a position to deliver this .
i am aware that is also what the honourable member want .
that is fundamental and what the commission is absolutely engaged in .
forest fire in the summer of 2009 ( debate )
madam president , commissioner , thank you very much for your explanation .
we need a policy of prevention , but also a policy of coordination .
we must not think along medium-term and short-term line .
we need to lay the foundation for a long-term strategy .
for the time being , we have this small unit based in corsica .
i am delighted that they have moved this resolution .
let me move on to the commission 's observation .
mr tzavela , obviously , it is not just greece .
hence the reason why i think we should be more ambitious .
natural disaster can not be avoided , but they should be prevented .
the barnier document and others submitted by parliament have already been mentioned here .
what is the commission going to do in this regard ?
is it right that the 2010 budget provides nothing for this force ?
the sudden rainfall doe not explain this level of destruction .
twenty life have been lost , all in my country .
we are told that it is the member state that must decide .
this must stop , and to stop it we also need financial resource .
that , of course , is why parliament support the european solidarity fund .
we call on the council to finally release these fund without obstacle .
the region need the money urgently for reconstruction and for prevention .
apart from that , however , fire fighting is primarily a national competence .
let u take the first step before the second .
i also think raising awareness and fostering a culture of prevention are fundamental .
why can we not do so in relation to offering protection against fire ?
they can find no direct link to climate change a yet .
with climate change , natural condition will change ; that is a fact .
that cause problem in land development , reforestation and fire prevention policy .
now , commissioner dimas , what is rather strange in all this ?
the council ha now failed to do anything about this for two year .
mr president , i wa listening to this debate in my office .
however , there also need to be european added value in the response .
let me give you a specific example from my own country .
romania wa hit by natural disaster in june of last year .
emergency often involve a high human , financial and environmental cost .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 16 september .
europe need to show solidarity in the face of such natural disaster .
the community 's solidarity fund is a sound and valuable financial management tool .
prevention remains vitally important , however : forest must be maintained and cleared .
free trade agreement with south korea : impact on european industry ( debate )
korean customer buy some eur 25 billion worth of eu good every year .
this make korea one of our most important export market in asia .
in addition , there wa a special focus on rule .
we are aware of the sensitivity of the car sector .
we should remember the significant korean investment in the car sector in europe .
on duty drawback , my final point , this is nothing new .
such policy are legitimate under the world trade organisation .
there is one exception , though , namely vehicle construction .
clear monitoring of potential new non-tariff barrier to trade would certainly make sense .
today , the bulk of these issue have still not been addressed .
i will cite just one example to illustrate our fear .
what should a trade agreement like south korea 's really contain , then ?
switzerland , i believe , is a strong example .
there are provision for switzerland to be part of the schengen passport-free area .
there is cooperation on airline , asylum and judicial matter .
so i conclude in asking , why not britain ?
we , too , can have the kind of assurance the swiss enjoy .
however , a level playing field will not be a disadvantage .
in the big picture , we could be close to real balance .
the commission ha long owed this to the citizen of europe .
i wa parliament 's rapporteur on the korean free trade agreement .
therefore , there are big winner in keeping world trade moving .
this is an important agreement , where europe ha achieved it strategic objective .
it provides real opportunity for chemical , pharmaceutical , other industry .
we are , in fact , an economic superpower .
the question is , is it the only way of solving a problem ?
the rest ha gone to developed country , european one in particular .
public development aid must be increased a a matter of urgency .
i hope i can count on your support throughout .
in this context our 'vulnerability flex ' instrument is of particular relevance .
however , developed country are beginning to come out of the crisis .
worse still , these resource will not arrive quickly enough .
i should like to hear your opinion on a whole series of point .
you also responded in favour of combating tax haven .
the issue of international governance ha already been discussed .
to my mind , this is obviously important , a others have said .
that is also my request to you , commissioner .
this requires boosting international aid and the need for more efficient development aid .
the reality is that imf assistance ha so far been negligible .
that said , commissioner , i wish you success in your new role .
there are various tool in place for this coordination of aid .
several member have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institution .
this is a target that i can fully subscribe to .
so this is , i think , a positive evolution .
the vote will take place during the first october part-session .
many country have a long way to go to balance their public finance .
the council 's draft also contains margin for coping with unforeseen event .
the logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple .
this is precisely what we have attempted to do .
the council 's draft is balanced , while still being ambitious .
there must be an emphasis on providing european added value .
it is vital for the eu budget to have adequate margin .
i will now take a brief look at the individual heading .
sufficient resource will be available for migration policy , including frontex .
however , there are some particular concern which i would like to highlight .
i would like to say that this is an initial discussion .
parliament already expressed it point of view in february .
we are far away from achieving both full employment and a knowledge-based society .
researcher born and trained in europe are working outside the european union .
we are therefore lagging behind when it come to innovation a well .
we want to increase those item which help tackle the crisis .
a you know , we spend four day a month in strasbourg .
another example is the court of auditor ' report on translation .
the second issue will be the mid-term review of the financial perspective .
it is therefore a thorough review of our multiannual guideline that we need .
this will be the first task of the new commission .
hopefully , we will have some easy one to deal with , too .
at the same time , i am very hopeful that we will succeed .
i would like to congratulate the commissioner on his appointment .
your predecessor is , today , the head of state in lithuania .
immigration , the role of frontex and cooperation among member state ( debate )
an important element in dealing with migratory flow is border control .
frontex is an important element in the eu 's integrated border management strategy .
since it launch in 2005 , frontex 's capacity ha been progressively expanded .
this situation requires a broad spectrum of both short-term and long-term measure .
this dialogue must be based on the principle of solidarity and shared responsibility .
since then , the commission ha been working on three major theme .
the second theme is that of the external border .
we must also examine how frontex can cooperate with third country .
fundamental right and the prohibition of return must be respected .
otherwise we run the risk of falling prey to the absurd .
unfortunately , in this field , frontex ha not yet made enough effort .
these are initiative that need to be put into place instantly .
without the cooperation of these country we will get nowhere .
however , this policy ha still not been developed .
the response must involve legal migration , a an alternative to illegal immigration .
finally , we must make a serious commitment to human right .
no , it is a joint responsibility , which requires a joint response .
back on 31 august , i tabled a priority question to the commission .
you will recall that many hundred of migrant perished off the libyan coast .
on 31 august , 75 somali were refused entry to libya .
really , the external border of the european union have become murderous .
but a 'one-size-fits-all ' immigration policy will not work for britain .
all this growth is due to immigration and birth to immigrant .
britain doe not need a common european immigration policy .
( nl ) mr president , frontex is not working .
it will result in even more people with no prospect entering europe .
i should like to give a further reaction to the swedish presidency .
the party for freedom reject this out of hand .
it is a smoke screen to enable mass immigration .
we shall be doing so , in any case .
i should like to add that enough is enough .
we need to have more and better coordination with europol .
these are the challenge and these are our commitment .
frontex undoubtedly play a key role in europe 's approach to migration .
sea rescue operation have therefore to be included in it remit .
commissioner , you spoke about the principle of non-refoulement .
it is important that we uphold these human right .
frontex must be properly resourced and respect human right of individual .
mr president , i do not really share your enthusiasm about frontex .
in the meantime , our notice board and computer are going wrong .
let u tackle the thing which we can really tackle effectively .
doe frontex have to bear the brunt of this fight ?
our only option is to comply with the convention that we have signed .
is it really necessary that they should have to risk their life ?
no , they should not have to do so .
i therefore thank france , but it is a drop in the ocean .
can you tell u why you are not introducing compulsory solidarity here too ?
ultimately , it is undermining europe 's political identity .
what doe the commission intend to do to end these violation ?
we have seen this happen between italy and libya .
do not leave it until the end of the year .
this is laid down in the european convention on human right .
for this reason , we need control in this area .
( sv ) mr president , thank you mr billström .
a lot of valuable opinion have been expressed here today .
that would relieve the pressure on the asylum system , for example .
the criminal network that exploit people 's desperation must be tackled .
there is no single solution to the migration problem .
it requires a package of various initiative within different area .
increased cooperation with the country of origin and transit is particularly important .
i think that this debate ha clearly shown that .
i have certainly noted the desire for greater transparency that ha been expressed .
in short , we are ensuring that this duty of protection is upheld .
the member state are affected by the same problem .
i consider it truly important to establish this solidarity .
there you have it ; i am not going to prolong these answer .
i have taken many note during the various speech that have been made .
we urgently need to adopt effective community measure on immigration and asylum .
some member have voiced the idea of establishing 'illegal immigrant quota ' .
i urge the commission to act quickly on their implementation .
this is a step forward towards managing all border .
ec-china agreement : maritime transport operation ; accession of bulgaria and romania (
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
i therefore endorse mr simpson 's report since it follows these general guideline .
this vote is in favour of the conclusion of this protocol .
i voted in favour of the mobilisation of these fund .
the current procedure for managing the solidarity fund make this difficult .
i feel , however , that portugal 's application wa not ambitious enough .
we must stop this development from going any further immediately .
in january 2009 , france wa hit by a severe storm .
storm klaus caused devastation , in particular to the country 's infrastructure .
my vote here is consistent with the opinion of the rapporteur .
the creation of budget item 18 05 02 03 ( european police ) ;
modification to the establishment plan of olaf , without additional financial provision .
i wished to take a stand against the ever-persistent use of nuclear power .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.20 and resumed at 11.35 )
that , in my view , is a modern take on political action .
mr president , i endorse the comment made by mr daul .
the number of member who hold opinion of this kind ha increased .
this is why i would say that you are right .
our group can fully identify with the programme you announced .
after all , solidarność can look back on three great achievement .
in any case , i wish you every success , mr president .
i believe that this is an expression of weakness rather than strength .
i can only say , mr president , that we face major challenge .
mr president , your election wa an historic moment .
unfortunately , these term sometimes become nothing more than fine word .
in reality , agreement are made behind closed door .
we are experiencing a financial crisis and an environmental and climate crisis .
democracy also requires that our civil right and freedom never be violated .
we currently have many proposal for the additional monitoring of our citizen .
freedom of expression must also apply on the internet .
mr president , i again extend my congratulation to you on your appointment .
you began by raising the problem of the economic crisis .
the union , sadly , ha not protected european from this situation .
on the contrary , it ha plunged them into it .
it is a personal victory for you , i know .
i am convinced that the european parliament rest safe in your hand .
we must think about how the treaty of lisbon will change our situation .
i hope that we will be able to do all of this .
this mean that there must now be no direct election of mr barroso .
unfortunately , many people do not feel this way .
the reason for this is that there is no equality of right .
mr president , you have encouraged everyone to use their mother tongue .
mr president , you have suggested acting a a mediator .
please can president barroso clarify his policy and intention here ?
( hu ) president buzek , you spoke about the slovak-hungarian dispute .
i believe , however , that our path diverge considerably .
i urge them to remain firm in their resolve to reject the treaty .
it remains the wrong path for europe and europe 's nation .
if not , their possible successor in the conservative should do the same .
i hope that the commission will also follow this example .
we can not sweep minority issue in europe under the carpet .
thank you for your attention and i wish you every success .
i hope that what you announced will come to fruition .
if we can not achieve this in europe , then who can ?
this ended only recently with them all being released , virtually without exception .
the prime minister paid tribute to the outstanding job done by the police .
i would like to hear your view on this , mr president .
let u also remember pope john paul ii and the faith aspect .
this doe not mean , however , that europe is equal .
this is very good , because it always yield something new .
i very much appreciate the emphasis that it is our europe .
mr schulz stressed that it is a two-and-a-half-year programme .
what i really had in mind is that we need continuity .
mr verhofstadt stressed the significance of the citizen 's voice .
the voice of the citizen ha enormous significance here .
parliament represents the citizen , hence our great responsibility .
why ? - because we need greater contact with the citizen .
the crisis doe , of course , reveal an enormous lack of trust .
mr kamiński stressed that we have different view on the future of europe .
i agree with this , and we should indeed listen to each other .
i have no doubt that the problem of social justice is important .
let u endeavour to make the impossible become possible .
mr malmström - yes , we are working with the swedish presidency .
there is also a very important programme - the stockholm programme .
our neighbour are found around the mediterranean sea and in eastern europe .
however , let u not contend with one another in this way .
it is very important that we maintain a balance .
mr lichtenberger spoke of the role of parliament when we make law .
if the treaty of lisbon come into force , this will happen automatically .
i said firmly that the eu ha fund for promoting cohesion .
however , it is also better to open border than to move them .
we are , indeed , talking about cooperation between nation .
mr antinoro then spoke about the achievement of my country .
mr ransdorf doe really represent the citizen and the life of the nation .
they remain in force ; nothing ha changed here .
this is why i propose most definitely a common energy policy .
i would like once again to thank you all for the discussion .
this is an important moment in the history of european integration .
thank you for the programme which you have presented .
i hope that you will manage to complete this ambitious agenda .
this vision of the future of europe is attractive to very many european .
( the sitting wa suspended at 13.25 and resumed at 15.00 )
( hu ) thank you for this opportunity to speak .
this includes , in particular , minority , gay , rom and jew .
they tried , in fact , to disrupt a national ceremony using violence .
this committee made suggestion and numerous court proceeding were also initiated .
statement by the president-designate of the commission ( debate )
the next item is the statement by the president-designate of the commission .
mr president , lady and gentleman , we are living in unprecedented time .
yet this crisis is not just a financial , economic and social one .
there is the financial crisis , but also the energy crisis .
now is not the time for the status quo , or routine .
now more than ever we need a strong europe .
it doe not necessarily mean more centralisation of power .
i think it wa a very useful , constructive and open discussion .
but we can not return to the previous growth model .
yes , we need to map out a genuine european agenda .
i stand for a particular emphasis on innovation and support measure for smes .
yes , this mean overhauling the lisbon strategy after 2010 .
we can not allow a return to 'business a usual ' .
the issue of bonus , for instance , requires urgent action .
i want europe to keep it world leadership in financial service .
this regulation will be codecided by the european parliament and the council .
europe need the mean to match it ambition , however .
this will reflect the central priority i attach to research and innovation .
i think we have a lot to do in this field .
what i propose is no le than a transformational agenda for europe .
i am committed to making my contribution to european parliamentary democracy .
let me finish with a plea to each and every one of you .
a president of the commission , my party is europe .
we need a commission that delivers on it promise .
in the past , europe wa described a a political dwarf .
obviously , the president of the commission could not represent a single party .
lady and gentleman , thank you for your attention .
it may be that you have a majority tomorrow .
therefore , for u it is also a question of programme-related issue .
you have said that you will put them in place .
we also need a change of direction on wage policy in europe .
however , i expect you to say it once .
we need a change of direction within the eu .
perhaps not all of you have taken note of it yet .
this is a new rule , which we did not have before .
however , i am pleased that a new fellow member ...
after what i have heard , i understand why .
we will decide this evening on the final vote for our group .
then , i hear what mr daul ha to say .
i wa part of the electoral campaign in france .
all the same , it is incredible , this whole business !
no , but stop , stop , mr barroso !
because we have a system that make them completely crazy .
yes indeed , i remember your speech , i remember what you said .
and , mr verhofstadt , that really take the biscuit , now .
not at all , not at all , mr barroso .
is mr barnier going to get the internal market ?
what is he going to give to the german ?
what is he going to give to the british ?
that is the problem ; that is the reality .
the european conservative and reformist will vote for president-designate barroso .
there are , unfortunately , many question on which we do not agree .
we thank god that today , we live in a europe at peace .
i am glad that mention ha been made today of european solidarity .
iran is a country which make no secret of it nuclear ambition .
the ideology of liberalisation , deregulation and privatisation ha led to the crisis .
european policy must focus consistently on the interest of the people of europe .
i can not identify a focus of this kind in your guideline .
i would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some example .
we expect the new commission to restructure the posting of worker directive .
you maintain that you can do nothing about this .
well , of course , the answer is ireland and the lisbon treaty .
but it is possible that i have got this horribly wrong .
so maybe i got it wrong : maybe you are the right man .
( hu ) mr president , europe ha reached an historic turning point .
they want to combat the gross injustice of neoliberalism and global big capital .
these include family farmer , smallholder , small business owner and government employee .
it is parliament 's debate with the president-designate of the commission .
there are just two thing i would like to say .
he ha our clear support to lead the commission for another term .
my second comment is also self-evident , but it bear repeating .
we are living in extremely uncertain time with considerable and difficult challenge .
the commission doe not and ha never advocated the privatisation of public service .
i think that the usual exercise of brussels-bashing go too far sometimes .
so let u try to reconcile both principle in a way .
let u not give into interpretation of the european court of justice .
i have always said 'better regulation ' or 'smart regulation ' .
better legislation : mieux légiférer , not moins légiférer .
there is one political issue that is very important .
i am not in favour of cutting our job in europe .
they have not sold well , the 'stop barroso ' t-shirt .
a party put forward a candidate before the election .
i should very much like the pro-european force to support a pro-european programme .
i have presented a very pro-european programme to you .
it is up to you to vote for me .
it is not i who decides who must support me .
i have a pro-european programme , linked to the treaty of lisbon .
i am proposing to you now a new ambition for europe .
this is the first time that we have had this enlarged europe .
who among u doe not have scope for improvement ?
there are many new path for u to tread .
i would like to add : no strong european commission .
each of u ha his or her own share of responsibility .
the commission president ha a great deal of the primary responsibility .
however , a martin schulz said , this is not just about him .
how will we create a commissioner for financial market ?
i am sure of many others on the left a well .
secondly , we think your word about a crisis exit strategy are premature .
you have modified that in what you have said to u today .
thirdly , your transformational agenda is the agenda of the past .
also , forgive u if we judge you on your track record .
( de ) mr president , lady and gentleman , why now ?
these are the two question which we need to answer .
the question 'why now ? ' ha already been covered here .
this is why we also need to vote now .
a liberal , we also have high expectation and demand .
we believe in equality for all people in europe .
i would ask you again to agree to do that .
i read president barroso 's political guideline with great interest .
lastly , there have been reference throughout the debate to the lisbon treaty .
there is no reason why this could not continue to be the case .
more and more people are saying : 'nothing good come of europe ' .
now , you are changing the word but not the deed .
that is why our delegation will deny you it vote .
lady and gentleman , where are the nation of europe ?
where are the parliament of europe and where are the european voter ?
i do not actually believe in that very much .
unfortunately , president barroso , in a democracy you can not please everyone .
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
now you are saying that you will do everything i have asked for .
how can we suddenly start believing what you say ?
there , mr barroso , are some of the question facing you .
it is on this basis that we shall judge your future action .
we need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policy in europe .
mr president , president barroso espouses a europe of ambition .
ukip place sovereignty and the citizen 's right above solidarity .
we reject the lisbon treaty and president barroso 's vision of it .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
hopefully , they would also find out what you did five year ago .
that wa when you promised most people a very great deal .
secondly , the vote now is different to the last time .
it applies only to question to the previous speaker , not for statement .
the implementation and interpretation issue that have created uncertainty are the problem .
i did not say that there are no more problem .
a you know , the initiative on that come from the member state .
i am committed to doing my best once again .
regarding the issue of social matter , let u put this bluntly .
it is not intellectually honest to attack the commission all the time .
i want to bring the broadest possible consensus and exclude nobody .
we need a strong europe , but there is a contradiction there .
we are going to weaken you in front of the member state ' .
there is a contradiction there , so let u be honest about it .
europe can not work on fanaticism , or on dogmatism .
i thank the epp for the support it ha given me .
you do not have a project for transforming europe environmentally and socially .
the next decade will decide where europe is going to be .
the current leading generation in western europe had a holiday from history .
we made debt and passed them on to our child .
unfortunately , europe doe not have a culture of achievement .
if you fail there , you will fail everywhere .
i have never seen a demonstration in favour of a european tax .
when it come down to it , we all have very little influence .
the measure taken are not fulfilling all expectation and are still not satisfactory .
this wa not the case 70 year ago when europe wa at war .
here are some guiding principle for the continuation of your work .
protectionism is an abomination - even for a former maoist .
the strength of the eu lie in it open border and free trade .
human right apply to everyone , wherever they are .
free europe 's farmer and give consumer and the market a chance .
the eu doe not need more institutional power struggle .
this concept appears to harbour serious danger in term of worker protection .
today they parade through public square and speak openly to the medium .
so , mr barroso , the ball is in your court .
it wa the french presidency that found the way to the emergency exit .
in so doing , you are severely hampering copenhagen 's chance of success .
mr barroso , three time you have failed to make the grade .
our path diverge completely on the lisbon treaty , mr barroso .
i look forward to this relationship continuing and my constituency benefiting from it .
we are not only experiencing a crisis , but also a changing world .
the crisis is not yet over and it landscape is still unrecognisable .
this is why we hope that the treaty of lisbon will be ratified .
it is a tool box that will make the institution work .
it is obvious that we can not identify with this majority .
energy security also depends on the eu 's neighbour .
you show contempt for the meps ' memory of event .
for this we need an industrial policy to be adopted .
what guarantee can you give u that this will be the case ?
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
whether these are danger or opportunity depends to a great extent on ourselves .
if you do not want mr barroso , who do you want ?
you can count on the vote of the portuguese socialist .
i wish you good luck and success in your work .
it is , in fact , about taking responsibility for europe .
in this area , we are faced with several new challenge .
mr barroso , at what stage are the preparation for this institution ?
can we expect concrete and effective measure from the commission ?
i believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field .
are you satisfied with your achievement over the past five year ?
are we going to see more of the same , or something new ?
is there anything we ought to be looking forward to ?
of course , we all have different view on that .
that is how democracy work , and that is how we work .
we are confident not only in you , but also in this parliament .
it represents the genuine integration of different root and culture .
you have already announced the creation of two new commissioner post .
the union must have the financial resource for it ambition .
some of my fellow member have already stressed this point .
i would like to thank the european commission for working with u .
the european single currency ha proved it stabilising role in these crisis condition .
firstly , that of presenting competition a an absolute and insurmountable dogma .
in the future , it is our task to build europe together .
i am counting on you just a you can count on me .
( pl ) madam president , europe is united .
it is a europe of peace , freedom and democracy .
you , mr president , know this best of all .
what you have accomplished in five year speaks for itself .
you do not say where they should come from .
my question is : what about a financial transaction tax ?
we have not seen his position on modified product .
i know it is difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state .
in this respect , we are facing a serious problem with the environment .
this is absurd and truly difficult to justify democratically .
we can not make these mistake with people 's money .
people speak of green shoot a part of the economic recovery in europe .
the ratification of the lisbon treaty is a green shoot in itself .
the investment community and people who create job want the lisbon treaty enacted .
( ga ) i wish you the very best of luck tomorrow .
for this reason , i will be voting you out of office .
( hu ) thank you for this opportunity to speak .
i would like to ask president barroso two question .
madam president , i would like to begin with a procedural issue .
i shall try to respond quickly to a large number of question .
unfortunately , at that time , no one paid attention to our recommendation .
this is a european creation ; it is a contribution .
the 21st century could well be europe 's century .
it is the american who are now taking inspiration from the european model .
what are the american and other major power doing today ?
they are starting to talk to u about combating climate change .
of course , we have problem in europe , consistency problem .
re-read my document and you will see that it is in there .
i believe that we have some good credential there .
that , once again , is what make europe .
i myself do not need advice from anyone on this issue .
we have an unemployment problem that is much greater than before .
that is why i have called for a new social ambition .
mr in 't veld told me that i had not convinced her .
you are very difficult to convince , mr in 't veld .
i believe that we need an industrial base in europe .
i believe that we have the mean to achieve this .
we are world leader when it come to financial service .
what is the point of handing over the leadership to dubai ?
i do not see what the point would be .
to conclude , i would like to say something very important to you .
some have said : 'why should we elect you ?
i myself have very often wondered why i am the only candidate .
i lose to an ideal candidate from each group .
some say : 'you are too close to the government ' .
i am a politician ; i am not a technocrat or a bureaucrat .
i defend parliament and i want to engage with you in this debate .
this is what i shall aim to do if i have your support .
i would like to thank the president-designate of the european commission .
thank you very much once again , mr president-designate .
the next item is question time ( b7-0203/2009 ) .
the textile and clothing sector come from decade of managed trade .
since early 2009 , trade in this sector ha been fully liberalised .
the sector ha been evolving successfully and ha maintained a world-class export performance .
there are municipality with textile mill where unemployment is over 20 % !
i therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done ...
that is precisely what we are seeking to do .
subject : eu priority for intergovernmental conference on climate change
i would , however , like to say a few more word .
this fall short of the 25-40 % reduction required by science .
we welcome the fact that japan will strengthen it target .
these plan would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support .
adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in copenhagen .
mr president , i would like to thank commissioner dimas for his answer .
but the discussion in the united state are ongoing .
we must come up with specific solution for specific situation .
would it be possible to increase the aid for developing country ?
should the eu not be more active at international level ?
the problem of overpopulation in africa is clearly limited to individual country .
a lot of maternal death result from abortion in unacceptable circumstance .
we have seen it in all country all over the globe .
subject : suspension of negotiation on free trade agreement between the eu and colombia
we are therefore following the situation in colombia very closely .
twenty-seven trade unionist have been murdered since the beginning of january 2009 .
i am very pleased that mr higgins ha asked his question .
i have read the legislation for 'buy american ' .
in the absence of mr moraes , i am afraid question 27 fall .
the directive ha applied to new facility since may 2008 .
( de ) thank you for your accurate and comprehensive answer .
there are many of these case in these area .
consequently , there is also money from this source .
appointment to interparliamentary delegation ( deadline for tabling amendment ) : see minute
g20 summit in pittsburgh ( 24-25 september ) ( debate )
the situation remains uncertain , but it could have been much worse .
the g20 process ha had the following significant result :
we have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategy .
extensive work will continue to be required both at national and eu level .
this is a very high priority for the swedish presidency .
the new u administration ha also adopted a very significant stimulus plan .
i will come back to this briefly at the end of my speech .
this ha involved intensive regulatory work over the last year .
emerging and developing country quite rightly aspire to a more appropriate representation .
it is a summit where decision have to be taken .
what do you hope to achieve in this regard at the g20 summit ?
that is the most important message this parliament can give the pittsburgh delegate .
now you need to start putting it into practice .
that is the most important task that we must now set ourselves .
please help u to take advantage of this experience .
we can not get out of this on our own .
the g20 want to tackle it on the basis of case-by-case information exchange .
the only thing that rose more than bank profit wa unemployment .
the reality is that high finance give the order and politics obeys them .
( de ) mr president , we need democratic revolution .
it is good that there ha been progress here .
we have seen that there wa significant support to fulfil this objective .
my second observation is that we must not fall for gimmick .
i am expecting specific - and fast - measure from the g20 .
i hope that the eu member state will all pull together .
they deserve to get the loan to which they are entitled .
that will be one of the controversial question at the g20 summit .
however , global economic recovery is also on the agenda .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i welcome your determination .
the strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary .
please make your voice heard above those of the three tenor .
i agree that it is important to regulate bonus and tax haven .
these are all necessary , but inadequate , measure .
it is more important to make an effort in term of supervision .
i especially agree with him on his charter for sustainable economic activity .
this , in my opinion , is an urgent issue for the future .
what sum will you put on the table at the g20 next week ?
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trend .
we should subject the bank and other financial market operator to proper supervision .
we must work together on sensible rule to win over our g20 partner .
a code of ethic ha been drawn up in hungary .
do you not think we should tackle this issue ?
yes , we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial market .
we need more coordinated global solution and effective and functioning international institution .
we would also like to take up the matter of climate financing .
we will be having a special discussion on unemployment at ecofin in october .
it is always the most vulnerable in our society who suffer first .
it is hitting the poorest in the world hard .
many member have raised the matter of hedge fund and new financial regulation .
thank you very much for a highly interesting debate .
i believe that this commitment ha been made very clear at previous summit .
however , without a functioning financial system , nothing else can be sustained .
the vote will take place during the first october part-session .
allow me to express a few thought i have on this subject .
these undertaking must be realistic , fair and accountable .
a specific financial pledge is needed to achieve this .
number three . flexibility mechanism must continue to be given an important role .
at present , four of them have already achieved this .
recently , though , the role have become rather confused .
this is the background against which world leader should operate .
that is why europe should speak with one voice at the summit .
there have already been step taken in this direction .
the united state of america very recently announced a huge financial legislative package .
this week mark the anniversary of the collapse of lehman brother .
the next item is the council statement on swift .
in order to do this , we need international cooperation .
the presidency is convinced of the benefit of information from the tftp .
in short , mr bruguière said that the commitment have been honoured .
firstly , there must be a balance between civil security and civil right .
for me , that is a little bit back-to-front .
why have you not consulted the national parliament on the mandate ?
every effort is being made to exclude parliament and hold back information .
this sort of untransparent approach is unacceptable for a democratic europe .
we green will have nothing to do with this .
the scandal ha made the european authority sit up and take notice .
an agreement ha been signed with the u government .
an expert ha made an assessment of this agreement .
we are therefore sceptical about the quality of his report .
mr president , thank you for these important point of view .
obviously , it is crucial that the information is reliable .
naturally , this restricts how the information can be used .
in order for this to happen , we need an agreement .
i am entirely convinced that we will achieve this .
mr president , i have a small point of order .
eu strategy for the baltic sea area ( debate )
the economic crisis ha made the matter of job and growth highly topical .
our aim and goal in this respect are clear .
the high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome .
since 2004 , the baltic ha become the eu 's internal sea .
i would also like to express my special gratitude to commission president barroso .
you just said that there are no additional fund .
we now need a baltic sea action plan to end this .
is it right with respect to the citizen of lithuania and other state ?
unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase .
do we not have a better way to spend eur 800 million today ?
sustainability must therefore be included right from the planning phase .
i would like to make four point , mr commissioner .
the baltic sea is suffering two major acute environmental problem .
the first - overfertilisation - ha already been mentioned by mr hassi .
the problem is that the baltic sea need a healthy ecosystem .
i can see saving in linking up local and regional body .
an effective mechanism for implementing and monitoring the strategy is also important .
it ha to be simple , transparent and free of superfluous bureaucracy .
regular review of the introduction of the strategy and interim report are essential .
i welcome the swedish presidency 's active role in getting the strategy going .
the author of the strategy mention the need for close cooperation with russia .
last year , the european parliament took a negative stance on this .
development challenge increasingly do not respect administrative or political border .
our financial sector is interconnected with the scandinavian one .
unfortunately , there are no social condition for such assistance .
without proper financing , however , the project will not succeed .
the commissioner referred earlier to the flagship project , 80 in total .
that is why investment in treatment plant need to be promoted .
it is clear that we face enormous challenge here .
one of these concern trafficking - an area mentioned by mr jäätteenmäki .
there are also other partnership in the baltic region .
naturally , this is something that the union will continue to work on .
the ignalina plant ha nothing to do with the baltic sea strategy .
neither doe nord stream have anything to do with this .
the baltic sea strategy is an internal eu strategy .
i would like just to refer to three broad group of issue .
several member mentioned the need for additional fund for new project etc .
at present , we have more or le three option .
this is the nord stream sea-bed pipeline between russia and germany .
chemical weapon were sunk here after world war ii in the late 1940s .
( the speaker wa interrupted by heckling from the right )
today 's agenda includes electing the president of the european commission .
this election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution .
the vote will be held using the electronic system .
i say this because there are many new meps in the house .
forest fire in the summer of 2009 ( vote )
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
today we are facing an unusually important , but also symbolic vote .
this is why i am unable to support your candidacy .
mr president , may i add a personal remark .
i have no personal problem with josé manuel barroso .
how , under those circumstance , are we going to get smart regulation ?
the european commission 's policy need to be reoriented .
mr barroso is not the man for the job .
this value ha been acknowledged by the european parliament in this vote .
over the last five year , dr barroso showed strong , comprehensive leadership .
the text you sent u doe not make this clear .
today i voted against mr barroso 's candidacy for three essential reason .
josé manuel barroso ha certainly not furthered a strong europe .
he must not be in any way an advocate for national interest .
consequently , i chose not to vote for president barroso 's reappointment .
i have come to this decision for four reason .
the european council unanimously proposed mr barroso 's candidacy .
i would ask mr barroso to use his influence to counteract this evolution .
it foreign policy programme make no reference to the sahara or palestine .
to wait for a phantom candidate would be a mistake .
a portuguese nursery rhyme say a tree is a friend .
once again this summer , forest fire have devastated the south of france .
that is a fact that can not be contradicted .
the deforestation is partly due to the construction of road and railway line .
for me , two proposal seem essential to improve the situation .
i voted in favour of the resolution on forest fire .
that is more than in the whole of 2008 !
in writing . - today 's debate on forest fire in welcomed .
we must show solidarity with our colleague and help the country affected .
criminal behaviour should also be suitably punished at a national level .
i am very pleased that commissioner benita ferrero-waldner is also with u today .
these act are aimed at stabilising the financial market .
would minister malmström like to take the floor before signing the legislative act ?
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i know that parliament ha a strong interest in this issue .
tajikistan is an important part of our overall strategy for central asia .
this hardly accessible country is one of the poorest in the world .
we are already doing this through a number of contact .
we are well aware that this is no easy task .
we must continue to encourage tajikistan to introduce a programme of reform .
the country is vulnerable to radical movement and international organised crime .
we welcome tajikistan 's interest in cooperation and support it effort .
a key element in tajikistan 's vulnerability is it weak economy .
there is progress , but clearly more need to be done .
this process will be supported by our delegation in dushanbe .
i warmly recommend that you adopt the agreement with tajikistan .
i do not wish to dispute those charge here .
let u remember that tajikistan is the poorest of the former soviet republic .
the european union is tajikistan 's primary trading partner .
merely criticising what is wrong in tajikistan will not achieve this .
i would like to raise another point regarding the question of water resource .
the problem ha already been addressed here in general term .
madam president , quite honestly , this debate give me mixed feeling .
i hope , commissioner , that this is also followed up on conscientiously .
madam president , i am very much in favour of this agreement .
this agreement is a direct contribution to the stability and security of europe .
we are well aware that this is an extremely crucial issue .
this region ha often been dominated by foreign power .
we should exploit this opportunity to establish a real partnership of the free .
we should therefore say that this is about partnership , not paternalism .
mr peterle deal with all this very systematically in his report .
the eu is supporting a number of sustainable development project for hydroelectric power .
i am sure that the commission will return to this later .
a mr tannock rightly said , we should not marginalise tajikistan .
so we know that this is an extremely important issue .
for that , we have introduced bomka , the border management programme .
we are also organising training . training is among the european union programme .
let me say a second word on the human right question .
i have known about these problem for very many year .
i think only in this context can a permanent solution be found .
thank you very much for your help and cooperation .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 september 2009 .
in return , the eu would offer visa-free travel .
these are important element in alleviating the consequence of the economic crisis .
where kosovo is concerned , the commission 's proposal involves no change .
here , the visa requirement will remain for the time being .
the commission proposal ha been submitted to the council .
a for montenegro , a lasting solution must be found for displaced person .
for that reason , these are the right proposal .
however , the citizen in the european union equally expect security .
our citizen expect those rule of play to be adhered to .
we should not give these state a free rein .
it fails to reflect the delicate nature of this issue in the region .
freedom of short-term travel is a vital part of preparation for that .
it is not a if there are no anomaly at present .
the process would be exactly the same , though a bit later .
we understand , especially to the people of sarajevo , your frustration .
the rule have to be the same for everybody .
we appreciate the progress that ha been achieved recently .
they are the only one who can not harbour dream of dual citizenship .
they feel overlooked , belittled and punished by the european union .
that responsibility lie with the council , the commission and parliament .
bosnia is close to having it visa requirement lifted .
i think that the wrong wording wa chosen in june .
i would ask the commission and the council to help these country .
mitrova is a member of the bulgarian association 'ratko ' .
facilitating visa-free travel can not be regarded simply a a technical issue .
( hu ) thank you very much , madam president .
i too would like to welcome mr cecilia malmström and commissioner barrot .
i am also delighted with this proposal that ha been put forward .
we know that some very serious step must be taken .
it is very important that the three country are now given visa-free travel .
that is why the liberalisation of this visa regime is urgently needed .
we intervened militarily , in order to liberate the kosovars from oppression .
i hope that this can take effect in july 2010 .
however , i believe that unfortunately , the commission 's proposal is incomplete .
i believe that freedom of movement is the gateway to democracy and knowledge .
this integration is therefore crucial and must happen a soon a possible .
solidarity should be given in return for taking responsibility .
their only source of knowledge about europe and the world is television .
we have an obligation to strengthen their european prospect a well .
we must ensure that the criterion set are met .
that applies whether we are talking about visa or accession .
i know that the people of albania and bosnia and herzegovina are disappointed .
we must support them and we must help them .
i hope you will help u to take it .
it is the first time that we have really had a regional approach .
we simply want the road map 's objective criterion to be observed increasingly .
i will also give you an answer on kosovo .
macedonia wa on europe 's side when europe needed it .
their government have demonstrated that they share the same value a we do .
the balkan country are an integral part of europe .
instead of protection , it inflicts harm on young people .
what i am interested in today is what you intend to do .
what have you - and the council - already promised the lithuanian parliament ?
being different is normal , including in this , our common europe .
where - in book , theatre , cinema , advertising ?
that is certainly the least that the member of this house can ask .
so , whom doe it protect , and from what ?
the british conservative introduced in great britain a similar law in 1988 .
there is legislation at community level to safeguard this area .
we welcome this initiative and hope it will be adopted before long .
naturally we take the european parliament 's concern very seriously .
it is about respect for fundamental right and human right .
the phenomenon represents a flagrant violation of human dignity .
these amendment should be proposed at the end of october .
thus , our resolution is practically knocking on an open door .
what we should be doing is concentrating on parliament 's intention .
dear colleague , parent and grandparent , please now listen to your heart .
i wa surprised ; i thought he would justify it more .
anti-discrimination and freedom of expression are absolutely fundamental principle in european law .
instead , it is against gay and lesbian citizen of the country .
this is to say that i strongly support the resolution .
this mean that this is not an internal issue of lithuanian policy .
nobody ha given the european union authority to act in these area .
i would say it is about the equal value of all people .
that must also apply to all the individual member state .
i will not even count how many human right it violates .
i will simply say in brief : i fully support this resolution .
the voice of non-governmental organisation also fell on deaf ear .
i have studied the issue and that is the case .
therefore , these discussion are needed a is the resolution .
this house is requesting an opinion from the human right agency .
madam president , i fully agree with the minister 's conclusion .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 17 september 2009 .
no member state may enact law that contradict these document .
people who are afflicted by hatred for homosexual deserve no sympathy .
they are not so much homophobe , a sexual orientation chauvinist .
it also confirmed that no type of sexual orientation is a disorder .
the next item is question time ( b7-0203/2009 ) .
the council share the member of parliament 's concern regarding animal welfare .
i know that we in ireland have certainly bought into it .
this is what i can say at the moment .
but we also very much welcome the opinion of the european parliament .
so i think we need to be sensitive to this issue .
it ha been delayed for reason i do not know .
it wa intended that this would supersede the framework decision of 2002 .
these two proposal are currently being discussed in the council .
it is a shame , but that is the situation .
are you going to raise it on another occasion ?
i know that mr hedh is very committed to these issue .
it is very unfortunate that the conference in brussels clash with the session .
madam president , we are covering many different issue .
the un fao conference will start on 18 november .
this action plan involves many different type of reform .
this wa welcomed by the european council in june 2008 .
what role do you think our policy can play in that ?
now the world situation look a little bit better .
there are positive report coming from almost all the different market .
there are really serious implication for food production in the eu .
so for the moment , i can not give you any more detail .
is enough being done to promote awareness of these key instrument ?
thank you very much for your very concise response .
therefore , the proposal to eliminate that ha no support from the council .
however , we are aware of the situation and of the problem .
we have asked the commission to present an alternative proposal .
so the social fund is only one instrument to combat unemployment .
we intend to have an urgency debate on this matter tomorrow .
that is the essence of the un 's charter .
it is also an important requirement for accession to the eu .
the next opportunity will be at the foreign minister ' troika in november .
the council ha worked continually and very actively on her behalf .
we called on the authority in burma to release her immediately and unconditionally .
i will have to come back to you on that .
this is essential if we are to foster economic recovery and fight protectionism .
the u ha a key role to play here .
we are conducting discussion concerning how this can be done .
there are complicated technical issue and it will take time to pursue them .
madam president-in-office , i would like to ask you about the eu-usa-russia triangle .
president-in-office of the council . - i am very happy at this news .
let me also thank parliament for it ongoing work in this area .
the top line is good news : price are improving .
you know the key element of what we have been doing .
a i said , our current approach seems to be working .
many dairy farmer are seeing their very existence under threat .
the main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sale .
the commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard .
it would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation .
commissioner , i would like to thank you sincerely for your work .
it remains for you , commissioner , to duly follow them up .
ten of thousand of job have been destroyed in rural area .
the european union had counted on growth in world demand .
european policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment .
the milk price imposed on producer do not cover production cost .
the european union must put a stop to it export refund programme .
it ha terrible consequence in term of employment and land use pattern .
without the small farmer , there will be no europe .
when the dairy sector struggle , the rest of the rural economy struggle .
and , also , please tackle the marketplace : it is not working .
( fr ) madam president , commissioner , i will be brief .
i think that there are two part to this debate .
you propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relation .
in order to regulate a market , we need public regulation .
after this crisis , that is what the debate must be about .
the livelihood of dairy farmer are under serious threat .
the current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution .
the margin that the farmer receives is so unfair .
the consumer will not have to pay any more for their milk .
i hope you learn the lesson for the future .
the market itself offer the explanation for falling price .
yes , short-term measure to overcome the crisis are urgently needed .
i think this is the right decision to make .
there are , however , two point that i want to make .
that is what i term a dysfunctional price-chain mechanism .
it is a shame that no one listened to u .
we are not the mouthpiece for the farmer ' interest .
what that mean is that our producer are in the process of decapitalising .
those measure do exist , we will grant you that .
( e ) we can not allow the milk sector to collapse .
we must prevent these falling into a negative situation .
the collapse in price clearly show the inadequacy of support measure .
we must ensure fair competition and also reinforce traceability during marketing .
the complete withdrawal of quota will deal the deathblow to many small farm .
is this the sort of policy that the commission want to implement ?
the fact is we need a restrictive system for the dairy industry .
dairy producer do not need your compassion , commissioner .
we are all deeply shaken by what ha happened .
i would like to ask the commissioner to take action on this issue .
in my view , this is an insult to our farmer .
the main problem is the price at which milk is purchased from farmer .
this is now even putting at risk the upkeep of rural area .
mr bové is quite right and mr fajmon profoundly ...
but is it not possible that the problem lie somehow with the basic ?
we are asking for specific advice or a proposal on how ...
i belong to a generation which experienced food rationing .
could i then just correct the misunderstanding on the super levy ?
we are not introducing a new super levy system .
germany ha a tradition or number of discount supermarket .
it ha been a very interesting discussion here today .
this decision wa based on the european commission 's erroneous market forecast .
furthermore , we also oppose the permanent removal of quota after 2015 .
european dairy producer can not endure the loss caused by large-scale price volatility .
but quota alone will not save the dairy sector .
the survival of milk producer is now seriously under threat .
the commission must stabilise the dairy market in europe quickly .
it is nonetheless vital for u to adopt more effective intervention tool .
we therefore need to adopt urgent measure to prevent this from happening .
energy security ( nabucco and desertec ) ( debate )
we have identified three source that are ready to commit gas volume .
the country that have the resource would expect more forward-moving decision .
i believe that the transit issue is more or le solved .
desertec is also an industry-driven initiative that is currently at an initial stage .
a large concentrated solar power plant will be inaugurated this month in seville .
last but not least , there is definitely the issue of interconnection .
there are two type of interconnection that we need to separate .
we have supported the integration of market in north africa for some time .
progress ha been made , but we need to strengthen these measure .
the second type is physical interconnection with the european union , using cable .
i believe that desertec will come step by step .
this house ha been a very strong supporter of energy efficiency .
a you quite rightly said , diversification is also necessary .
my third point concern the solidarity that is needed in the eu .
we are dependent on unstable region and country with undemocratic regime .
mr president , there are two point that i want to make .
nuclear power , nuclear fusion and nuclear fission are of vital importance .
i would therefore like to hear the commission 's opinion on this .
secondly , diversification of source of supply requires greater commitment to nabucco .
what are the council and commission doing to resolve this unhelpful situation ?
the global energy supply is also part of crisis prevention and peace policy .
diversifying the source and the transport network fulfils this requirement .
it is much more likely to be just a very expensive dessert .
desertec and nabucco are important instrument in this regard .
that is the crucial point that we need to get across here .
i believe that we will then indeed find an appropriate solution .
i will give you the example of my country .
this is linked to my call to reinforce the supply from southern europe .
desertec and nabucco are central to meeting these challenge .
we need to develop renewable energy production - solar thermal and other .
well , it should be , and it must be .
nabucco will only be successful if it receives long-term political guarantee .
the success of these plan depends solely on our political will .
mr president , we have three main concern with nabucco .
a similar situation also prevails in baumgarten , austria .
mr president , europe 's future depends on securing energy .
in relation to many of these there is a connected development issue .
we need to concern ourselves with concrete matter and work on those .
here , too , there is not just one answer .
maybe it is because there are 27 interpretation of what energy security mean .
south stream definitely mean increasing dependency on russian gas .
in the south , there is the south stream project .
here , too , the eu member state are keen to get involved .
nabucco may prove to be an excellent step towards ensuring energy security .
mr piebalgs , congratulation on all that you are doing .
a for gas , we are going to have a gas war .
with regard to desertec , i would like to offer my congratulation .
this is an excellent project for the euro-mediterranean area .
the desertec project is especially significant in that it point to the future .
i am pleased that this is exactly what the commissioner underlined today .
the original promise wa for some eur 30 million .
we need to realise that we have to go further .
the eur 200 million allocated to the european economic recovery plan are insufficient .
we call on the european union to supplement the fund allocated significantly .
the eu must invest more in the diversification of energy supply source .
we therefore need to diversify in term of supplier and route .
we must ensure that the work on the medgaz pipeline is quickly completed .
a lot ha already been said today regarding nabucco and desertec .
the question now is what price europe is prepared to pay turkey .
european gas consumer can not be left at the mercy of monopoly .
what supporting measure can the european commission take with regard to this ?
what can we expect from the next commission in this area ?
in the uk we are keen on new nuclear power station a well .
but of course there is no one answer to ensuring our supply .
i would also like to make two further quick point .
i would like to say something more about this .
i personally submitted a written question to the commissioner following this transaction .
however , regulation on transparency can be easily circumvented .
mr president , the open market is a joint european achievement .
let u not make ourselves vulnerable precisely on this issue .
even the current level of funding point to this fact .
there are no compromise either on enlargement or on human right .
all the project have been well checked for cost efficiency and future viability .
so i believe that is the right support to give .
all the activity pursued by the member state also benefit the european union .
for this reason the second strategic energy review is still very important .
but i doubt that we could go further than that .
developing common rule for the supply and transit of gas ;
romania ha been and remains a strong supporter of the nabucco project .
there is only one small problem : it is not ours .
now , we have the french edf company signing into south stream .
this is possibly our last opportunity to rally behind nabucco .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
2009 and 2010 intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder (
common agricultural policy ( cap ) : support scheme for farmer (
energy security ( nabucco and desertec ) ( vote )
( for outcome of the vote and other detail : see minute )
it is true that human right fall within the competence of the union .
i therefore consider this resolution to be an ideological disgrace .
mr president , see how the thicket of eu regulation grows .
let me make my position absolutely clear on this .
in this regard , the promotion of sale is more important than stockpiling .
many european dairy producer are therefore now facing ruin .
this only distorts the market while not preventing price instability .
a few multinational company would then dominate the european market .
this week we are debating the milk quota system in a remastered form .
that , i think , sum it all up .
the member state have to work together on this matter .
energy consumption is continuing to grow , but the natural resource are limited .
that justifies continuing public intervention for butter and powdered milk .
the milk surplus must be stemmed at national level by imposing european requirement .
this is why agriculture must remain a priority area for the eu .
we also need to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data protection .
for this reason , i have voted against the motion for a resolution .
that is why we have decided to abstain on this resolution .
therefore , we have decided not to support this resolution .
what could be more natural , where child are concerned ?
this resolution is not just criminal , it is disgusting !
those who want to see a better europe should vote against this resolution .
the economy of many member state are heavily dependent on agriculture and farming .
it is not an ideal solution , but it help .
it must also encourage better organisation within the sector .
the commission ha stood by and watched this development for far too long .
the comprehensive agricultural reform that we have adopted is too little .
with this resolution , we are ready to take responsibility for european agriculture .
that is why i voted in favour of the present resolution .
thousand of small french producer are under threat of bankruptcy .
that wa recognised and accepted by all responsible politician .
hopefully , thing will never get that bad again .
we need security of supply and not just in the energy sector .
we support measure to regulate the dairy farming sector .
for this reason , rapid action by the eu is sought .
however , all these measure have been rejected by the european parliament .
this would give the country a significant mean of applying pressure .
in writing . - we recognise the different concern of our various ally .
the reference in this resolution to the lisbon treaty are highly detrimental .
energy security is first and foremost the responsibility of our own government .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
situation in taiwan following the recent typhoon ( debate )
over 150 people were killed and ten of thousand displaced .
around 700 000 home were left without drinking water .
in response the european commission activated the community civil protection mechanism .
the mechanism facilitates and coordinate member state ' in-kind assistance during major emergency .
the rapid delivery of this assistance ensured a tangible expression of european solidarity .
the presence of the european team on the ground wa also received positively .
natural disaster can affect any country in the world .
they often carry a heavy human , economic and environmental cost .
thousand lost their belonging and large area of land were laid waste .
the damage amount to more than eur 2.5 billion .
the reconstruction of an infrastructure that ha been widely damaged will take month .
shortly after that , prime minister liu chao-shiuan resigned .
he merely wanted to pray for the victim with the survivor .
taiwan must ask itself whose side it is actually on .
one mudslide wiped an entire village off the map and killed hundred .
to date , 120 million people are living in area affected by typhoon .
between 1980 and 2000 , there were 250 000 typhoon victim .
we are the developing world that caused climate change .
we must pay by giving financial support to developing country .
the incident took a heavy toll and the economic damage wa immense .
it is time for u to show solidarity with the citizen of taiwan .
( pl ) i would like to thank the commissioner for this information .
however , my question is of a slightly different nature .
therefore , i would like to ask the commissioner the following question .
is there an emergency action package or provision for specific country ?
that is what i wanted to ask the commissioner .
all of this is possible and is no obstacle to the one-china policy .
working relation , that is what it is about .
the humanitarian aid provided by the european union must be unconditional .
the aim is to help victim a quickly a possible .
if such a request come , we will take it into consideration .
we would welcome parliament 's feedback on this communication .
six outstanding journalist and human right activist dead in le than eight month .
i am reminded of this story when human right issue come up .
we are not a diplomatic body ; we are a political parliamentary body .
these people are being murdered one after the other .
threat , kidnapping , torture , arbitrary detention and murder are becoming commonplace .
that ha nothing to do with interfering in national affair .
following this invasion , soviet troop shot at least 21 768 polish citizen .
the theory that these murder are 'coincidental ' is not a viable one .
our message today should be addressed to the eu government and the commission .
in katyń , thousand of polish officer were murdered on stalin 's order .
today 's russia is not brave enough to face this horrific truth .
it current government is providing unconvincing justification for their former alliance with hitler .
today 's germany is an example of such an attitude .
( pt ) good afternoon , lady and gentleman .
the effect of these murder are therefore unpredictable and worrying .
mr tavares , i would like to respond to your comment .
let u work together to prevent this from happening to human right .
this is not the purpose of today 's debate .
every effort must be made to detain and punish the murderer .
russia ha got used to the equivocation of the eu .
what would be the right course of action at a time like this ?
however , i am afraid this is not the case .
because such demand are only made of state outside the european union .
it is a pity that this is how thing are .
they are highly respected partner in the implementation of human right project .
violence against human right defender is not restricted to the north caucasus .
the next eu-russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussion .
the safety of human right defender must be the first concern .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
a human tragedy which unfortunately occurred where a man lost his life .
i hope the house will throw out these resolution and support the amendment .
the czech and the german presidency were here on thursday .
that is the solution , not condensing the whole agenda into wednesday .
in this regard , i fully support mr jeggle .
the commission will continue to follow this case closely .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
we also have a request with regard to the eu .
on two occasion , we have succeeded in obtaining a release .
for more than five year he wa forbidden to travel .
however , overall it remains a brutal one-party dictatorship .
it is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation .
the case is not the first of it kind .
we in parliament last intervened in a similar one in 2007 .
the work of ngo in the country is problematic and thus virtually nonexistent .
only in that way can we make human life worthwhile .
he wa also denied the right to leave the country .
the eu ha already expressed it concern to the syrian authority .
despite being important , these action are , nevertheless , insufficient .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
murder of human right activist in russia ( vote )

i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
it wa a great day for ireland and a great day for europe .
a thousand thanks , and congratulation on the result of the referendum .
i would like to make one more important comment on the irish referendum .
we can not forget those who voted 'no ' .
those who voted 'no ' also want to tell u something .
i would like to move on to two other matter .
her murderer have still not been brought to justice .
anna is not , however , the only victim .
you probably did not listen to the whole of my speech !

in addition , the following report were not received in time :
mr haug 's report - draft amending budget 9/2009 : earthquake in italy .
before mr lamassoure 's statement , i made two proposal for change .
the second wa about voting on motion for resolution on passenger compensation .
i would like to ask if there are any motion on these matter ?
we must act in accordance with the rule of procedure .
it is therefore right that we defend it and support it .
that is precisely the point that we want to discus .
we should therefore do that and reject the motion proposed by mr daul .
we are therefore in favour of adopting a resolution after this debate .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
it is always necessary to go through everything in order .
we shall now go to the main item on this afternoon 's agenda .
so , all of this is very good news for europe .
therefore , it is very important to put this lisbon treaty into force .
that leaf u just the czech republic to have the full 27 ratification .
i strongly feel that we have no time to lose .
thank you very much for your proposal and very clear message .
the treaty now ha the democratic endorsement of all 27 member state .
now what we need is the ratification procedure to be concluded .
a long period with a caretaker commission is in nobody 's interest .
i understand that you will debate this at the next plenary .
it is an important aspect of how the european union doe it business .
we need to fix exactly how the new system should work .
so we need to maintain the strong role played by parliament today .
finally , i would like to mention the european citizen ' initiative .
they gave an unequivocal and resounding yes to this question .
my thanks to mr reinfeldt and mr barroso for their proposal .
you can count on the ppe to help work progress quickly .
mr president , we are discussing the result of this referendum .
like the rest of u , mr barroso , you were very pleased .
it is not about institutional game that are now to be played .
china ha 1.3 billion inhabitant . india ha 1.1 billion .
these two country together represent a third of the world 's population !
these country now sit round the table in the g20 talk .
that is the explicit goal of the treaty of lisbon .
mr klaus should accept his historic responsibility and sign this treaty .
now is the time to bring this process finally to an end .
so the same argument applies now to the nomination of the commission .
there is really no reason to wait to proceed with the commission .
i say that is not a problem : prepare your global package .
and we still do not have to wait for several week and month .
put the commission together now , a fast a possible .
i believe that the debate on europe need to continue .
then there wa a confrontation and the majority won .
mr schulz , you should not always point the finger at others .
that is life ; that is how it is .
we are going to have a president of the european council .
i do not want this to be a coup d'état .
we need to put everything on the table and then you decide .
mr barroso is correct and mr verhofstadt is correct in this instance .
the treaty of lisbon is not the end of the story .
the constitutionalisation of europe can not stop with the treaty of lisbon .
the socialist and the liberal reneged on their promise .
the lisbon treaty ha therefore been a missed opportunity .
the treaty of lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition .
instead , we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenge .
oh , so you respect this vote , do you ?
you did not respect the last vote , did you ?
... there is a real debate , there is a real debate here .
that is also what i am trying to achieve here .
once the 27th country ha ratified , we will move on .
it need parliamentary ratification before the process is complete .
that is what we are trying to achieve here with the swedish presidency .
that wa a wise decision of the european parliament .
the important point now is to see how to deal with this transition .
so the question is : how long doe it take ?
for that , i need the council to take some decision .
some of you said that there will be a 'president of europe ' .
i am sorry : there will not be a 'president of europe ' .
we can not assume that people will appreciate it benefit .
let me now raise one issue which i feel need to be raised .
that is what the whole eu project is about .
i am happy to say that i called it correctly .
that demonstrates a lack of responsibility with regard to european policy .
i would also ask the social democratic member to make that clear .
( ga ) mr president , the people of ireland have spoken .
that is the reality that we all have to base our position on .
we can see a democratic majority and a blocking minority .
we have work to do now and we must not waste any time .
do we have a clear statement and a clear language in this regard ?
if not , we will not be taken seriously .
however , let u not attempt to conduct further institutional debate now .
in every single case , we can show that lisbon brings improvement .
these are our rule , and we must keep to them very strictly .
we had positive referendum in luxembourg and in spain .
this one wa therefore by no mean the first .
it is always amusing to listen to mr farage .
the shock of a two-thirds majority really cut to the quick .
today , for once , it wa not entertaining to listen to you .
i very much hope that at some point , that will change .
now some people are complaining that ireland wa pressurised .
they have the sovereign right to decide on these matter .
others are complaining that ireland only said 'yes ' because of the crisis .
that will be the litmus test - including in the commission hearing .
your country , sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question .
the disadvantage is that it shift the centre of power further towards europe .
only then can we gain the support of the european electorate .
what happened in ireland in the referendum wa not a victory for democracy .
the eu commission intervened continually : interfered in the process .
he is the regulator of transport , supposed to protect consumer and worker .
i think you are in the chair , not the honourable member here .
finland , a small country , wa right there .
if you win by foul mean , you have already lost .
it wa won by foul mean , wa it not ?
look where maradona is now , he who won by foul mean .
in this case , however , it wa just a year later .
this is eu democracy and it will one day reap it just desert .
i love ireland ; i have been there 20 time .
i am just sorry to see such a massive landslide .
first there were 53 % against and 47 % in favour .
this time the result wa 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
i wish ireland and the irish every success and may god bless them .
jobbik 's representative can only support a european union founded on national tradition .
the subject of a new basic treaty wa first discussed in 2002 .
last friday marked the end of the process for adopting the new treaty .
poland announced that it is going to ratify the treaty immediately .
even the problem today with the blue card is another example of this .
we only need to look at the g20 meeting to see that .
instead , this need to be discussed openly with the people of europe .
it ha promoted peace and reconciliation amongst the people of europe .
the will of the people expressed through a referendum is direct and unequivocal .
i believe that the people wish to see greater democracy ...
i believe that it will result in a centralised superstate .
the czech have also said 'yes ' to the lisbon treaty .
the authority of it president depends on the will of parliament .
it is now up to the rest of u .
that is like saying that election can not be held more than once .
this is why we have democracy and why we vote several time .
now , in this chamber , we have before u a great task .
we are going to be presenting big european project .
i hope that europe will no longer need to hold it breath .
that is the most significant achievement of the treaty of lisbon .
that is also something that i would like to see .
i would like to say thank you to nigel farage .
the tory , on the other hand , are in total disarray .
david cameron 's position on the lisbon treaty is quite untenable .
at best , he can be accused of dithering .
they pretend they have changed but they clearly have not .
ireland ha guaranteed itself and all member state it own , national commissioner .
we are therefore very pleased with the irish people 's decision .
what the citizen are waiting for are political answer from europe .
there is not just one vote , there are two .
the 'no ' to start with and then the 'yes ' .
i think that we need to proceed quickly now .
the social crisis : is europe capable of having an employment policy ?
it represents a victory for common sense and reason against demagogy and manipulation .
the irish people have clearly stated that they believe in the european project .
the treaty of lisbon mark the beginning of a new era .
mr president , it ha been a long debate but not very dramatic .
i think we are all of u to blame for that .
it will also make linguistic and cultural diversity an eu norm .
however , the treaty of lisbon also ha an extremely important new provision .
we can now finally embark on creating an eu structure for protecting minority .
mr president , i stand here today a a proud irish mep .
however , it is a lesson we have to learn .
i should like , however , to make two comment .
( e ) mr president , briefly , i have three message .
i am really and truly , quietly , delighted about this .
the institutional coherence and balance of the european project is at stake .
i believe that parliament ha played a constructive part in this reform treaty .
that would be the answer to these controversy on european policy .
the eu 's own security and development also depend on this .
any delay would create problem for farmer throughout the member state .
moreover , this will is shared by the vast majority of european citizen .
this is certainly true of the treaty of lisbon .
amongst them is a colleague of mine , méndez de vigo .
a politician , we have to shoulder huge responsibility .
we can now look forward optimistically to finalising ratification .
our journey thus far ha been long and arduous .
we can not allow ourselves to weaken the foundation of european integration .
it ha to be useful and it ha to be effective .
whether by representation or by referendum , this coming together is real .
some people appear to be confused on this point .
one reason is that the irish were given a guarantee .
this is what would also be needed to protect europe 's minority .
however , there are at least two aspect that require caution .
i only wish that we were smarter than that .
this is not fair and is , in my view , morally wrong .
the new president of the eu will be the head of state .
preparation are under way at the moment for a major electoral fraud .
i am making an so appeal on behalf of the romanian people .
unfortunately , the hungarian parliament wa the first to do this .
i also sense a certain frustration in here about the timetable now .
the timetable in prague is still a little bit unclear .
meanwhile , the presidency is working , of course .
but all those name mentioned are named in the medium .
thank you very much for an interesting debate , mr president .
i think it is very important to say this .
now ireland decided to carry out a second referendum .
they maybe prefer to forget that this is a discussion about a reform .
civil society also engaged , a i think mr kelly explained very well .
of course , we do not debate these thing in a political vacuum .
you have to provide information and a debate and a discussion .
the downside is that it also divide the population .
the irish vote is a definite vote in favour of europe .
however , political will is needed to tackle these challenge .
the western balkan state have enthusiastically welcomed ireland 's ratification of the treaty .
2010 is the year when we hope the treaty will come into force .
mr president , lady and gentleman , who are we laughing at ?
the delay ha now lasted for over one and a half year .
this is unjustified , reprehensible , and even illegal .
in not fulfilling this obligation , he is breaking the law .
if so , it is high time to initiate the procedure for impeachment .
the polish people do not want to hinder development of the european union .
on the contrary , they want to initiate beneficial change in europe .
president kaczyński doe not have the right to interfere with this .
the share of vote allocated to poland under nice wa very advantageous .
we wait with hope for the final ratification of the treaty .
the next item is the council statement on the situation in guinea .
during the violent repression , several opposition leader were wounded and temporarily arrested .
he proclaimed two day of national mourning and pledged to investigate the violence .
the european union immediately and forcefully condemned these brutal and shocking event .
our international partner have acted in line with u .
well , there are three main area of action .
captain camara 's decision not to run could allow calm to return .
we discus the effectiveness of development cooperation fairly often .
it is mr camara himself who ha humiliated his compatriot and african .
it is a paradox , but the situation is fairly simple .
we must demand a halt to the use of violence .
it is time for this infernal spiral to come to an end .
we believe that this is another important decision that the council must take .
doing so would send out the wrong message to the guinean government .
it would be a scandal which i can not bring myself to endorse .
we call for the explicit condemnation of the repression of the demonstration .
you have talked to u about targeted sanction , minister .
however , could you give u some more information about this too ?
i will say it once again : this is a matter of urgency .
the fishery agreement relates to tuna fishing for 25 european boat .
it reflects the commission 's evaluation of the previous agreement .
i believe that he must be supported by our diplomatic effort .
in fact , it voted by just one vote to do so .
quite astonishingly , the ppe group voted solidly to retain the agreement .
the minister mentioned possible sanction to be taken against guinea .
i think we can say that the european union ha been extremely clear .
that is the only way we can really exercise pressure .
the whole world community ha asked for that to happen .
we are also open to answering other question and to discus sanction .
i can only encourage you to continue the discussion with the commission .
it is the commission which is responsible for eu fishery policy .
my thanks to you and to the member for this debate .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
however , gas is not the only energy resource available to european state .
i am talking about the pan-european constanţa - trieste oil pipeline .
it may have been foreseeable , but nothing wa done to prevent it .
there must be no more horrific tragedy like the one in messina .
unfortunately , these declaration are contradicted by reality on a daily basis .
the situation in northern portugal is an illustration of this .
just take a look at what ha happened with the lisbon treaty .
i would like your constituency to ask you to do that , too .
please come and exercise the solidarity that ha so often been mentioned today .
in my opinion , this is a very unfortunate state of affair .
they were handed down sentence ranging from 10 to 15 year .
the european parliament sent a fact-finding delegation to serbia in january 2005 .
mr president , this is happening in a country in our neighbourhood .
mr ivanilovas must be allowed to return to lithuania .
the european union 's common position must not be wasted .
there is only one explanation : poland is a church state .
i deeply regret the need to raise this matter in this chamber .
he call a two-to-one majority in ireland a 'victory for bully boy ' .
all too often , those word are unchallenged by journalist .
i would like to give you a positive example in this area .
i put forward certain concrete measure , but nothing wa done .
france is taking this action and we can see the result .
( hu ) there ha been much talk earlier about minority .
quite simply , europe must behave more coherently if it is to prosper .
on this point , i wish to mention a specific example from romania .
the procedure for accessing european money is fairly complicated and impenetrable .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.40 and resumed at 21.00 )
prevention and settlement of conflict of jurisdiction in criminal proceeding ( debate )
the commission welcome the report and support some of the proposed amendment .
the report i drafted pay particular attention to three aspect .
the ppe position differs from that of the rapporteur on two matter .
our position on this matter only seek to prevent bureaucracy .
this is why we will vote against these amendment .
the pvv asks itself where this is all heading .
i would also like to make one important remark .
there is no provision intended to deal with negative conflict of jurisdiction .
i would like to thank you once more for holding this debate .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 8 october 2009 .
this is important when a cross-border criminal activity take place .
a procedure for establishing contact between the competent authority of the member state .
this will confirm or otherwise the existence of parallel criminal proceeding ;
avoiding adverse consequence by reaching consensus between the member state .
passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy ( debate )
in the case of skyeurope , it wa an airline based in slovakia .
i hear that you are in the process of consulting the interested party .
you intend to present a proposal over the next year .
madam president , thank you , commissioner , for your response .
indeed , mr simpson ha already presented it to u .
we are trying to protect consumer a far a possible .
a number of airline have recently gone bankrupt in rapid succession .
it is a matter of capital adequacy and insurance for return journey .
ronald schranz expressed regret at the inconvenience which had arisen for passenger .
for the skyeurope representative , this wa only a statistic .
in the case of other cut-price airline , this is not always so .
it should be an answer and a challenge which can be applied immediately .
any cost involved would be settled between the airline concerned .
i would like to ask the commissioner for a reply .
it service were used by a wide range of customer .
passenger must therefore make their claim in bankruptcy proceeding .
the chance of getting money back in this way are negligible .
it is therefore time to do something about this .
a large number of traveller now buy their flight ticket on the internet .
this may influence europe 's whole economic situation and competitiveness .
passenger ' compensation is also in relation to the accessibility of service .
the need for a clear regulation in this field is evident .
for example , in 2004 , the polish airline air polonia went bankrupt .
instead , whoever make the mistake must pay for them .
we would regularly see on television picture of family stranded abroad .
this is precisely why we must focus on the following objective .
we must think about tightening the rule on setting up company .
obviously the exact timescales and content will be decided by the next commission .
a a result , it practical operation is inadequate .
the next item is the commission statement on freedom of information in italy .
the freedom and pluralism of the medium shall be respected . '
let me also recall three other very important element of this directive .
we had an example of this a recently a yesterday in italy .
let me add another example of where we could act .
please respect my freedom of speech , mr schulz !
all i am asking is that you let me speak .
this is not the way to have a debate .
are italian citizen prevented from voicing their disapproval of any given law ?
are the italian court prevented from enforcing the law ?
the answer to all of these question is clearly no .
nonetheless , we can not allow the member state to become weak .
this good must be protected without hesitation by the union .
( the president asked the member to allow the speaker to continue )
this is not an italian issue : this is a european issue .
i do not want the sitting to be disturbed .
the point is that it is a disgrace for europe .
mr verhofstadt ha asked for this and i will also ask for it .
this heated debate show that something is going on .
let u get something going . medium concentration , please , mr reding .
perhaps there have been similar situation in other country .
the european parliament is not the place to resolve these problem .
this observatory could prepare a draft directive against concentration and for pluralism .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
are those force called murdoch , or something else ?
we need freedom of the press - and not just in italy !
following the victory of the left in 2006 , the problem miraculously disappeared .
such sponsor account for up to 68 % of these action .
in preparing this debate , i spoke with him a number of time .
( it ) mr president , i am most grateful to mr schulz .
i , too , am not an italian speaker .
our group feel that medium pluralism is not just an italian issue .
it is incredibly important in this debate to restate that perspective .
i would point out that only in china do such thing happen .
it take historical research : have the centre-left government done anything about it ?
excuse me if that seems a negligible factor at a time like this .
he is probably the very last person who should be speaking about this .
ala , the title of today 's debate is italy .
the largest source of income for the spd today is it medium interest .
( it ) madam president , i will try to be brief .
the situation is this : mr berlusconi control the italian medium .
this is the situation in which we therefore find ourselves .
is it right to ask europe to deal with this problem ?
definitely , because we in italy are not dealing with it .
you champion of freedom of the press against censorship !
he had to go on a hunger strike : what fine freedom fighter !
what freedom doe the italian press federation grant to the minority ?
they have to be silent , they have no column inch or airtime .
long live freedom , long live our free and democratic country ...
citizen have the right to defend themselves in these situation too .
not once in our speech have we mentioned the italian prime minister .
mr daul , when you quote mr napolitano , quote him in full .
for me , europe is the continent of the universality of human right .
i would ask you to reflect on this data .
we are all aware of the italian prime minister 's colourful character .
this ha been the view voiced in the debate so far .
while listening to the debate , two question occurred to me .
is the right to free assembly an important fundamental right ?
is it a important a fundamental right a freedom of speech ?
is the right to use your own language an important fundamental right ?
is it a important a fundamental right a freedom of speech ?
is the protection of personal privacy an important fundamental right ?
all i ask of you is not to employ double standard .
this amount to a form of additional financing through the court .
democracy in italy is therefore at risk if the government is brought down .
we have heard the information supplied by our fellow member .
what happens in italy concern u all , however .
here we are showing that fundamental freedom are at stake .
so i think that everybody can read this and recall it .
unfortunately , nobody is listening now , although this is very important .
they will be the basis for our future work .
first of all , article 7 is a very exceptional provision .
so far , it ha never been activated by the eu institution .
this is a fundamental question that ha to be discussed in depth .
would legislation solve the problem you all have in mind today ?
then the commission will take that a step forward .
i think , in the end , that is what the parliament want .
i would ask the bureau again to give some consideration to this .
we german social democrat are proud of our medium interest !
half an hour later , the ambulance arrived to treat mr niebler .
half an hour after that , the police were still not there .
one 's safety is not guaranteed in this city ...

g20 summit in pittsburgh ( 24-25 september ) ( vote )
( for the result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
madam president , we propose very seriously to exacerbate it .
so the g20 leader get together and they say 'what is the solution ?
and now we want to reform the entire financial system .
the implementation of the millennium goal is now at serious risk .
i see this report a a seed at least .
i do believe , and hope , that we take this very seriously .
( et ) mr president , i voted in favour of this resolution .
the crisis ha threatened the millennium objective set for the year 2015 .
i did not support the article in this resolution concerning the tobin tax .
the best thing is that it would not cost u a penny .
after all , experience ha shown that 'circular migrant ' remain in europe .
prevention effort are made in the light of climate change .
the event that took place in italy were tragic indeed .
in writing . - i voted in favour of amendment 7 .
the role of eurojust is also not clearly defined .
in our opinion , this is another example of exactly that .
in writing . - i decided to abstain on the final vote .
i believe that these should remain with member state .
i am pleased with the agreement concluded at the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
i am sure that they are a step in the right direction .
the rapid increase in the public debt and budget deficit are worrying .
the world is faced with a contradiction that will be difficult to resolve .
that wa the agenda of the g20 in pittsburgh .
the creation of new job must be seen a the most important goal .
we have today voted in favour of the resolution on the g20 .
this ha only been done in a superficial way , however .
there is no penetration through to real , needed reform .
it is for that reason that i have abstained from voting .
the door wa thus left wide open for total speculation .
the financial crisis show that international solution are needed to tackle international problem .
this is why i have voted in favour of this resolution .
we european must therefore support these country in building up their economy .
the financial crisis show that international solution are needed to tackle international problem .
the current economic and financial crisis ha given a new dimension to globalisation .
the first priority must now be accorded to poverty reduction .

therefore , voting will be held on this matter tomorrow .
not every issue in europe is an issue for europe .
the italian parliament ha just proven that it is independent .
mr president , this is actually something of a humiliating spectacle .
we want to say something in general about freedom of opinion in europe .
let u stick to this title . that is reasonable .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
in some region , unemployment is at 25 % .
in latgale , 50 % of worker have been laid off .
we must really care for the food security of our continent .
three year on , that legislation is still not in place .
the money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating job .
many regard the uk a a wealthy place to live .
the factory that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas .
that contradicts article 10 of the community directive on environmental impact assessment .
we all do this , bearing in mind our voter ' interest .
however , this is what václav klaus is demanding from u .
some other tv repeater will be closed in the coming month .
these tv repeater allow the reception of catalan television in the valencia region .
this ha not happened since the time of king hassan ii .
a civilian ha never been put in the dock in a military court .
this mean that repression is once again intensifying in this former spanish colony .
mohammad othman wa arrested on 22 september by the israeli authority .
this week , we are going to award the sakharov prize .
we must develop these thing , and act together to protect them .
they are our european author and our european publisher .
it is high time that this game came to an end .
there ha also been negligence in the investigation of crime against church .
the statistic for my country , greece , are tragic .
what doe the commission have to say about that ?
had it been a different matter , it would have intervened .
turkey wa ordered to pay compensation in this regard .
and it is strange , i have finished , mr president ...
the european union is the leading campaigner against global famine .
still some european contest the project , ignoring it new orientation .
religious freedom is both an individual and a collective human right .
jesus say : 'i desire mercy and not sacrifice ' .
this service ha largely been supplied by inn in recent year .
today , he is protesting that he wa denied entry into slovakia .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
political will is the only deciding factor between the two possibility .
hence , codecision is the right procedure to choose .
the citizen must have access to the result of these evaluation .
it is true that mr coelho raised the issue of codecision for parliament .
the treaty currently in force do not permit this .
restricting the role of an institution like the european parliament is wrong .
i propose to you that we support the draft resolution .
data protection ha also not always been subject to on-site evaluation . '
he called for a global ban on so-called 'naked body scanner ' .
nevertheless , we parliamentarian have a number of concern .
it ha also forgotten about it security provision for these .
therefore , we demand that data protection concern be taken into account .
we fully support the rapporteur and we also support his proposal .
i would also like to talk briefly about codecision .
( de ) mr president , we need a democratic revolution .
that is what we are seeing at the moment in my country .
perhaps our relation will become warmer in the future .
over the century , people 's movement ha been severely curtailed in europe .
suspicion of our fellow men ha dominated relation between the country of europe .
trust between the country ha , at time , been decidedly lacking .
mistrust , rather than trust , ha typified relation .
it is easy to forget the arduous road to get to that point .
come on , pull the other one : this place is a joke !
the system contains data on missing person , stolen good and judicial proceeding .
the second version of the system is delayed at least until 2011 .
schengen visa have been introduced , but they cost a great deal .
for them , schengen mean humiliation , a wall and a problem .
however , we are still mile away from that .
i am , therefore , convinced that schengen ha performed well .
this explains my esteem for carlos coelho and i fully endorse his report .
the same go for the domestic security of our member state .
schengen ha worked extremely well and it is visible for all to see .
the abolition of border control requires mutual trust between all member state involved .
i believe that it give too much power to the commission .
in real term , it try to disregard the european parliament .
our aim is not to exclude parliament , a i heard someone say .
the evaluation will be far more frequent and will be clearer .
those are my thought , madam president , lady and gentleman .
in the first place , there can be no breach in consistency .
moreover , the principle of mutual confidence must not be undermined .
very many application can be picked out and closely scrutinised .
these are different issue , but all connected by one important factor .
thus , we would be eliminating visa requirement on both side .
we in the gue/ngl group are in favour of abolishing all short-stay visa .
secondly , we are not throwing open the door at random .
either the whole european area is accepted or it is not .
i would simply like to thank all those who have intervened .
i have always tried to keep parliament informed of these development .
vi , for it part , ha entered an important phase .
this will give u an opportunity to review the issue in detail .
it ha ordered the contractor to implement all of the appropriate corrective measure .
we appreciate the manner in which he ha done that .
and what about the outsourcing arrangement which are being established ?
we can , i guess , expect some further slippage .
in the summer of 2012 , the olympics are being held in london .
those are a few of the question i would like to ask you .
i would like to use this opportunity to underline our position .
we also regret that more and more authority have access to these system .
indeed , there are now doubt over the viability of the project .
what action is being taken to address the shortcoming ?
i must say here that i continue to have confidence in vice-president barrot .
how much money ha been paid out on these ground ?
i shall try to keep to my speaking time .
in principle , we welcome the introduction of si ii and it functionality .
the delay need to be relentlessly analysed and investigated .
we should learn from past experience for the future .
we are now talking about it being developed perhaps over 10 year .
is the european commission ready to implement an alternative plan ?
will this equipment be used in the alternative plan ?
firstly , i am very grateful to all of the speaker .
hence , i am somewhat insistent on this point .
i sincerely hope that we will have made progress by then .
we reached an overall agreement at the end of july .
i have received three motion for resolution to wind up this debate .
the vote will take place at 11.00 on thursday , 22 october 2009 .
this gesture wa one of great attentiveness which we appreciated .
these are legitimate concern which we agree with in part .
european farmer expect immediate answer and too much time ha already been wasted .
no , i do not think that is the right way to proceed .
no , it want to continue paying out export refund .
we must not , however , give up any responsibility .
rather , a parliamentarian , that responsibility is our calling .
we must provide the dairy farmer with serious and long-lasting help .
i can partially agree with what the previous speaker said .
that is why i support this request to use the urgent procedure .
mr president , we are at a decisive point in time .
a number of key issue have not yet been resolved .
this mean that the bid currently on the table are not enough .
emission should be cut by at least 80 % by 2050 .
development issue must be absolutely central in the agreement reached in copenhagen .
climate change pose a threat to the millennium development goal .
expert in development will also take part in the negotiating work .
we will particularly highlight development issue within the context of the ongoing negotiation .
we need a sustainable international structure for cooperation and support for developing country .
the council is aware of the scale of the financing required .
we face a great challenge in these final week leading up to copenhagen .
i am therefore asking you to set the pace .
nevertheless , reaching a good deal in copenhagen is in our common interest .
developing country are the most vulnerable country to climate change .
first , building political alliance through reinforced dialogue on climate change .
second , promoting sound policy and strategy linking climate change and development .
it is now the time for putting offer on the table .
firstly , we have made offer in term of commitment .
but action by the eu alone is not enough .
finally , a word on the delivery channel for climate funding .
we a the commission are not in favour of creating new fund .
one party say 15 billion , another say 30 billion .
let u develop criterion for how the money is used .
for what are we going to do with them ?
we all know that it doe no such thing .
by 2050 , these climate refugee could number more than 200 million .
without a global agreement , we will go nowhere .
this solidarity must be demonstrated through financial and technical support .
this support must be in addition to our overseas development aid .
there is no doubt that climate change is accelerating .
the list includes a lot of well-intentioned , large and heavy present .
we have no influence on what the sun doe .
second , a hysterical obsession with man-made global warming .
can you not see the danger in this growing gulf ?
man-made global warming is an unproven theory based on manipulative statistic .
the effort and view of parliament are crucial to this work .
in this context , the very strong work of the eu is vital .
consequently , both oda resource and new funding will be required .
one crucial development issue is ending the deforestation of rainforest .
we have the most ambitious and the most far-reaching target in the world .
it is also a way of rejuvenating our economy .
it is about an engagement of the european union .
we must offer developing country a substantial amount of support in this regard .
much remains to be done in europe , too , however .
the commission 's proposal is quite simply not enough .
naturally , this support must be in addition to regular aid .
secondly , we must take the two degree target seriously .
firstly , the copenhagen conference is a gamble on the future .
skimping on that objective is out of the question .
once again , this is a time for eu leadership .
they , too , must face up to their responsibility .
combating deforestation is the best way of reducing co2 .
we voted against a we consider it to be euro-folly .
i strongly believe that the outcome will be decided in the political domain .
a decision implementing such an amendment wa actually proposed in the relevant committee .
it is our duty to negotiate a fair agreement with developing country .
'no new fund , ' say commissioner de gucht .
the developing country are now suffering a triple blow .
we must break through this logic in copenhagen by introducing new financing mechanism .
development policy must also be coordinated with climate policy from now on .
the two will have to be aligned with each other a never before .
africa need a protected market if sustainable agriculture is finally to emerge .
this is an emergency , but the negotiation are at a virtual standstill .
however , it is europe that hold the key to copenhagen .
but let u think for a moment of the problem facing this summit .
let u be clear : we really have no choice .
we can not meet our target without cooperation from other state .
a consistent approach to climate change should focus on reducing this dependence .
so we are all talking here about something which is not happening .
is n't this all about politics and big business ?
enough please , before we damage irrevocably the global economy .
one hypothesis is that the global temperature will continue to rise .
sometimes in life you see thing you never forget .
about three year ago , fiona hall and i went to northern kenya .
we went to one of the poorest community and met pastoralist farmer there .
cow are becoming a rare commodity in northern kenya because of climate change .
you could say that agriculture is the big villain in this context .
in developing country , the land is drying out and disease are spreading .
do you ask them to smile in the face of death ?
will you accept compulsory licensing of important green technology to the poorest country ?
will you save the forest by refusing the market-based mechanism of redd ?
adopting the solution proposed today will increase the inequality still further .
the resolution go even further - it proposes subsidising the poorest country .
that is why we have to go beyond a mere declaration of intent .
the council is talking about eur 100 billion by 2020 .
we need our own resource , therefore , not just palliative .
these are the realistic way of tackling climate change .
only new technology can enable u to maintain our way of life .
we must , of course , take account of intellectual property .
can the commission and the council explain their view on this ?
i would welcome mr carlgren 's comment on this .
this is not the kind of thing investor put their money into .
it is a vital and irreplaceable food for plant life .
the more plant receive , the faster they grow .
a shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus .
this is creating an aura of despair among coastal community .
expecting country to abandon coal just like that is unrealistic .
we should not exceed the 2 degree celsius mark .
a such , we 'll face these challenge steadfastly and responsibly .
now europe need ally , and support for it existing proposal .
commissioner , it is good to see you in place .
presidency , it is good to see you here .
talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough .
we are seeing the diversion of oda budget away from development .
we have heard the climate change denier here in this house .
this mean that in some place there is no water .
the effort to reduce co2 must be shared under the fairest of condition .
in copenhagen , we need to make a big effort .
we therefore need to go beyond 0.7 % of gnp .
this wa the message from various leader at the recent united nation meeting .
this wa the message from the president of the spanish government .
it wa a very informative event entitled 'prescription for a healthy planet ' .
at that point , the patient is damaged beyond recovery .
the commission and the council must finally get more involved in this regard .
the council and the commission must do more in this connection .
other region in the world , too , must do more .
at the same time , however , they experience the very worst repercussion .
we have a responsibility , but we also have duty towards these country .
the european union will be judged on this contribution and on this commitment .
it is up to europe to ensure that this message is clearly heard .
this agreement should be based on the principle of shared yet differentiated responsibility .
more attention must be paid to sharing the most advanced technology and knowledge .
( fi ) madam president , certain fact need to be acknowledged .
the world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climate .
i can see opportunity for my home country of estonia here a well .
however , we can not limit ourselves to this .
these , too , are country which must shoulder commitment of their own .
the industrialised country have provided a substantial financial aid package .
the future lie in a green , liberal market economy .
i believe that this prompt u to realise the value of this vegetation .
madam president , 'success or failure , that is the question ' .
( ro ) we live on a planet with a diverse climate .
i would have liked minister carlgren to have prioritised thing more .
ha no country in europe given consideration to this yet ?
we might solve a problem in one place and create another elsewhere .
the major obstacle to an agreement in copenhagen is the question of funding .
i , for one , am a believer in technology .
limitation alone will not help u attain our target .
we really must use these day in the best way possible .
i would also like to say that we need a global solidarity pact .
i would like to thank parliament for it support .
i think we need a frank and open discussion in copenhagen .
climate change pose a threat to the environmental balance and our habitat .
the u seems unable to pas legislation to curb it excessive co2 emission .
developing country claim correctly they did not cause this crisis .
some say we can not afford such new financing .
our economy will recover , but our environment will not ...
i believe that this problem must be dealt with in two way :
the issue of funding ha become the keystone of the agreement in copenhagen .
we need new investment in energy , new innovative technology and new operator .
the climate crisis must be inextricably linked to the economic crisis .
when making decision , we should also think of the citizen .
the only problem is that we have no time left .
the eu is determined to take prompt action to cut greenhouse gas emission .
additional action is required to alleviate this problem in the short term .
this is why the copenhagen conference must be an international success .
the eu is a world leader in the fight against climate change .
this position clearly give u a responsibility to help the developing country .
the link between developing country and the developed world are complex .

this ha already been debated in the g20 and many other forum .
in writing . - i have voted for this report .
in writing . - irena wa officially established on 26 january 2009 .
it is vital that this organisation start to function a quickly a possible .
in view of this , i have voted in favour of this report .
this will bring the european union closer to it citizen .
therefore , i have voted in favour of this report .
the measure themselves differ from island region to island region .
the smaller island of the maltese archipelago are particularly vulnerable .
i am in favour of such codification and have hence voted in favour .
the directive concentrate on codifying law without amending their actual content .
in practice , of course , this situation is shamelessly exploited .
unfortunately , we have allowed this opportunity to be missed .
for another , egg and poultry are amongst the commonest foodstuff .
a rise in illegal criminal activity must be avoided at all cost .
unemployment is one of the main problem affecting the european economic area .
in today 's vote , we voted to waive mr siwiec 's immunity .
consequently , i voted to reject the commission 's legislative proposal .
the establishment of an evaluation mechanism is important for all member state .
for this reason , i vote for rejection of the commission 's proposal .
let u stop cry crocodile tear and finally behave like responsible human being .
the situation unfolding in calais is a major political problem for the union .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
the winner in this will be europe 's citizen , through their representative .
ha the president of the commission been taking any action ?
firstly , mr rangel , thank you for your greeting .
i am very pleased to find this procedure now in the european parliament .
ireland did it by referendum , the other country through parliament .
the process of ratification is still ongoing in the czech republic .
therefore , the commission will just handle day-to-day business from november 1 .
in fact , there wa a real cushion effect on the measure taken .
so i think something wa , in fact , done .
we are now waiting for a response from the undertaking involved .
how can you still claim that we will be playing a leadership role ?
but the reality is that others have to match our level of ambition .
president of the commission . - thank you very much , mr kamiński .
for 2009 a a whole , that would represent a 4 % decrease .
so we are saying that we should keep the stimulus programme .
this is also a question of solidarity with future generation .
now there is also the effort towards global coordination of these policy .
a chance to hold the executive to account surely must be welcomed .
tony blair is the odds-on favourite with the bookmaker .
indeed , wa this the deal that i predicted back in 2005 ?
it wa not a great result - just 67 % of the people !
so there are no hidden agreement or secret bargaining .
co-chairman of the efd group . - mr barroso , i am disappointed .
you could have democratised the eu with this treaty .
we must keep to time if we are to have a lively debate .
consequence of the financial crisis on employment and social cohesion
( nl ) mr president , my question concern the crisis-response measure .
colleague , could i ask you not to ask supplementary question .
the most affected category are young people and migrant .
the issue of tackling child poverty also remains a very important priority .
my government intervened at the point where the crisis wa most being felt .
we put this on the council table , but it wa rejected .
secondly , why do we keep meeting in strasbourg ?
regarding the issue of being careful and rigorous , i agree with you .
today , there is a clear social urgency in some member state .
exceptional measure were needed for what wa an unprecedented situation .
it is a question , a always , of balance in judgment .
they say that the european union is to blame .
how can we link these strategy that are available to u ?
with regard to the tool , i will cite just one example .
a regard the actual distribution , there will be no major change .
i already announced the main innovation during my debate with you .
that is where we can create new product , new market .
there are three thing that i would like to call for .
secondly , we are currently adopting growth and rescue package all over europe .
why do these package not include a targeted job scheme for young people ?
in other word , we have to invest in other policy .
we need to do the opposite of what ha been done so far .
we are not suggesting that our social standard should be lowered .
mr barroso , the financial crisis in the uk is very serious .
one of the many sector struggling is the agricultural sector .
the equipment used to scan the sheep is not accurate .
i have been told it is only 79 % accurate .
we prefer general question about the crisis and how to overcome it .
i do not think it is in very good taste , really .
we have approved the small business act ; that is good .
there may be some more ; i am working on it .
for instance , ireland ha not yet designated a possible commissioner .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the 2010 budget is being drafted in the shadow of the financial crisis .
is the european union able to respond to this ?
is it able to protect the eu 's border ?
however , there is also an even bigger concern .
annual budget also feature commitment , many of which remain unfulfilled .
therefore , raising the payment level is an absolute must .
it go without saying we will have debate on this .
however , we will agree on the most important matter .
the committee on budget ha submitted a proposal for a manageable amount .
most institution create their budget on the basis of previous year .
europe is going through it worst economic crisis since the second world war .
budgetary discipline and sound economic management can accelerate the turnaround .
we will need to resolve the complex dairy issue .
let me tell you that this is a priority for the commission too .
i count on your support for achieving a satisfactory and balanced result there .
having said that , i do note some positive element .
i see that the baltic sea strategy got some extra money .
we will need to provide the necessary fund for that .
eleven million child die every year in the developing world .
so let u meet the percentage contribution we said we would make .
i will present three of them to you in one minute .
the second point is the inclusion of eu staff pension in the budget .
this is therefore something new compared to the 2009 budget .
there are two thing that we must impress on the commission .
you see , it is the same every time .
madam president , there is cut-throat competition in the world today .
developing country now account for 20 % of the world 's wealth .
in 15 year ' time , they will account for 34 % .
we need more resource to be allocated to research and development .
nonetheless , this is actually too little at this time .
the commission ha put it hope in self-regulation for far too long .
the first is the question of implementing supervision structure at european level .
moving on , i would like to emphasise the issue of fiscal policy .
there are various way of ensuring that this mutual interest is given expression .
unfortunately , the situation is much more serious than this .
the institute currently ha just a director and an assistant .
the commissioner will tell u whether this is an inadvertent error .
however , i should like to issue a warning .
the european budget is structured on two track : commitment and payment .
the commitment represent serious political intention , but also real , concrete action .
we support the draft budget put forward by mr surján .
we share the view that the crisis is serious and must be tackled .
we have been calling for this for a long time .
now we may finally see it laid on the table .
i will now turn to the argument about the dairy farmer .
we need quota , and we need good rule , framework and regulation .
these thing would really be a step towards a future-oriented policy .
that is what we expect from the negotiation over the coming week .
here , however , we will be looking at the budget .
we do not need drop of water in sea of milk .
what we need is another policy for rural area .
but still , parliament want to put more money into the eu coffer .
it can also be seen in the exploding unemployment figure .
they fear for their job and they fear for their pension .
europe wa a guarantee for peace and prosperity for a long time .
i will ensure that everything that is said is passed on to me .
it is difficult to set priority , but set them we must .
in it proposal , parliament invests and increase expenditure substantially compared with 2009 .
public finance in the european union are declining by around 7 % .
one of the result of the crisis is unemployment .
finally , my congratulation to the rapporteur lászló surján and vladimír maňka .
in practice , this refers to the execution of the eu budget .
i consider the criticism absurd for a number of reason .
instead , large sum are repaid to the member state a rebate .
i will ask it anyway and perhaps he will respond by another mean .
there will be no net contribution to the baltic sea strategy .
this is what our elector charged u with six month ago .
the european union decides on new focal area in it budget .
instead of an agency for armament , we call for a disarmament agency .
the figure for 2008 came out on 23 september .
each dutch citizen pay a staggering eur 267 to europe every year .
however , the new power will also mean new responsibility .
the first of the obligation is to fulfil interinstitutional responsibility and commitment .
firstly , the funding of the european economic recovery plan .
we have not yet been able to find a solution .
the council and the commission have just accepted eur 280 million .
commissioner verheugen ha promised that he will use these fund accordingly .
for my part , i want to mention just one special matter .
this ha evoked remark and reservation from some politician .
such remark have also been heard during the debate .
i would therefore ask for more information on the subject .
that scheme , like many more , wa cofunded by the european union .
to my understanding , the 2010 budget should have been slightly different .
mr gräßle , mr garriga and numerous other member have asked additional question .
i totally agree with his statement that there is a problem .
there is also a great deal of consensus on the objective .
i do not think that this is what the issue is about here .
i would like to thank the shadow rapporteur and coordinator .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 .
a programme for supporting the textile and clothing industry ;
a programme for supporting small-scale , artisanal coastal fishery ;
there are also certain policy area that need to be developed further .
the european parliament ha undoubtedly a crucial role to play in this debate .
the position of individual member state on this matter are very different .
we would all like to see a larger financial allocation .
this clearly show u that human right can not be divorced from democracy .
there are also situation where we have to think about various negative measure .
i would also like to hear what minister malmström think about this situation .
i would also like to say that democracy can not be exported .
in my view , we can not accept this situation in the future .
the effort made up to that point had been largely inadequate .
the israeli-palestinian conflict is a striking example of this .
poverty mean an absence of power , opportunity and security .
consequently , there can be no development without peace .
however , the intention is for the initiative to go one step further .
we are experienced in supporting democracy building in our external relation .
certainly , there is substantial room for improvement , however .
various instrument are used in parallel , and sometimes not very consistently .
this is undermining the impact of what we are doing .
we can draw inspiration from some of our success story .
our involvement in the western balkan is one such example .
that is why it is becoming a stable environment for democracy .
those responsible for development and human right issue are working together more closely .
the eu 's support for election process around the world is important .
they must be fully involved in the eu 's activity .
the government then risk losing both legitimacy and political support .
madam president , how can one bring democracy to a nation ?
europe must therefore assume it role a a soft power .
it is fragile but promising , if taken great care of .
those who take a short-term view no doubt think that democracy is costly .
mr president , can there be democracy without freedom ?
this brings u back to the notion of human right in this debate .
poverty is therefore synonymous with a lack of freedom .
there is therefore a close relationship between freedom , democracy and human right .
promoting democracy therefore raise fundamental issue linked to the intelligent stipulation of condition .
supporting democracy underpins our foreign policy goal of preventing conflict and reducing poverty .
in other word , what is in the pipeline ?
member state often have very conflicting and differing aspiration .
how can we pursue a common policy like this ?
how can we rid ourselves of these double standard ?
this is , of course , a very serious matter .
the human right situation there is far from satisfactory .
a mr hautala is aware , extending sanction requires unanimity in the council .
we hope that the mean of achieving this is through stronger commitment .
it accord entirely with the ambition of the swedish presidency .
we then look forward to continued discussion with parliament on this issue .
the next item is question time ( b7-0212/2009 ) .
subject : woman 's participation in position of responsibility in the job market
only 3 % of these company have board headed by a woman .
may i say that my question wa more specific .
a the questioner are not present , question 22 and 23 lapse .
the total cost of this project is eur 791 000 .
i would like to ask mr posselt whether he ha an additional question .
( de ) mr president , you are an impressive example of multilingualism .
in schirnding , for example , we have a german-czech nursery school .
therefore , my answer is a definite 'yes ' .
what matter is the quality of the project submitted by the various representative .
my answer to this question is a definite 'yes ' .
the subject of university in poland and germany ha already been mentioned earlier .
they demonstrate very clearly how efficient and effective this knowledge is .
the following is an overview of four of the matter concerned .
olaf is following closely the judicial proceeding in that country .
commissioner , you have an obligation to save european taxpayer ' money .
i can assure you that this information will be handled very seriously .
there have been many prosecution in the eu based on olaf 's work .
we all have an interest in enhancing this cooperation and combating cigarette smuggling .
it is an attractive challenge to consider this with country such a switzerland .
this is also the outcome : that they are cooperating .
a the questioner is not present , question no 27 lapse .
i would like to hear more about your view on this .
i presume that is the case right across europe .
nowadays , 19 % of young people in europe drop out of school .
approximately 15 % of young european abandon their schooling .
this mostly concern apprentice and other youngster on the job market .
they have improved their language ability and intercultural skill .
what measure doe the commission envisage adopting with this in mind ?
volunteering provides many occasion for non-formal education and deserves to be adequately recognised .
indeed it doe , and social value a well .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his response .
the eu urgently need a commissioner for human right .
the right of minority are being flagrantly violated in the eu .
( sl ) thank you for your answer , commissioner .
this is a very specific problem and one that concern people 's life .
the minority issue is not merely one of citizen ' right .
the second part of the proposal is the management of the quota system .
the possibility already exists today for member state to buy up quota .
that said , it is always better than doing nothing at all .
if it prof it worth , we will then agree to an extension .
i know that you do not have any more money available to you .
i also welcome the eur 280 million that you have announced for restructuring .
i would be grateful if you could clarify whether that is the case .
the commission must now bear the overall responsibility again .
let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support .
so this doe create a degree of frustration for the dairy farmer .
many have been under financial pressure for a long time .
however , i remain unconvinced by the buy-out scheme .
what do you see a the lesson from this crisis ?
looking at the future , what can you promise farmer ?
how will they avoid a similar crisis in the future ?
i would like to hear a clear-cut , detailed answer from you .
these farmer have ended up in the direst situation .
how and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated ?
perhaps it will be cereal , or something else .
this policy is no longer an effective mean to an end .
we can only hope that the money is paid and distributed quickly .
many farmer have waited too long to have the aid that is required .
( fr ) mr president , there ha to be consistency in politics .
that is not the issue at stake this evening , however .
( the president asked the speaker to speak more slowly )
the house voted last september that eur 600 million should be made available .
we have to understand that there simply is no more money available .
i find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quota counterproductive .
i feel i must reject any measure that restricts balancing out .
our farmer do not want to be constantly subsidised .
i think it is important that some have criticised the commission hugely .
i wa explaining to french listener what took place yesterday in luxembourg .
however , many member state claim that these quota are unfair .
do you not think that using an historical factor will maintain these injustice ...
however , many member state claim that the quota currently allocated are unfair .
do you not think that using an historical factor would maintain these injustice ?
otherwise , bulgarian producer will not be competitive even after 2015 .
in addition , we have the instrument of milk quota at our disposal .
is now the time for restriction on the production of milk or cereal ?
i am sure that is not what we want .
commissioner , austria wa always against the phasing out of the quota .
ok , you have chosen your path and followed it consistently .
how are we supposed to explain that to the farmer of austria ?
then i think there are lot of mistaken idea going round .
i have clearly said it ha to be on the basis of production .
i will reply to some of the specific question .
that is not the best image for european agriculture .
unfortunately , the commission ha taken a long time to act .
this policy statement wa approved by the european parliament itself .
i agree with the european farmer ' demand to drop the quota increase .
i also oppose the permanent abolition of the quota system scheduled for 2015 .
european dairy producer can not endure the loss caused by large-scale price volatility .
the carnage must be stopped now a a matter of urgency .
apart from u , only latvia and malta have such outstanding indicator .
the hungarian government can freely decide how to use this money .
that is why the european council will also look at these issue .
a i said , we will discus this in more detail this afternoon .
the major issue at the european council meeting will be climate change .
we will only reach agreement in copenhagen if all party take action .
recently , we have noticed cautious indication of a recovery in the economy .
a high level of employment is required for sustainable public finance .
the finance minister confirmed that the recovery is real , but fragile .
it is therefore important for u to continue with the expansive financial policy .
i would also like to say something about energy security .
we have prepared a report on the progress made since january .
the european council will take note of the report .
finally , there will also be a debate on external relation .
military solution alone can never lead to a sustainable solution .
without security and control , the economic progress will be lost .
we also need to invest in establishing democratic institution and strengthening civil society .
i know that this parliament is fully committed to this work .
we must carry forward the work we agreed at the g20 .
we must push on with our programme to address energy security .
the most important issue in policy term in the council will be copenhagen .
there are le than 50 day to go to copenhagen .
the copenhagen agenda is not just about climate change .
the lisbon treaty is the first treaty of the enlarged europe .
of course , we will respect that decision , whatever it may be .
we can well see that currently , we are in a stalemate .
europe must also do everything it can to create a fair commercial environment .
it is also about introducing new measure to stimulate employment .
now i would like to say something about lisbon .
the majority opinion at the time wa that they did not .
we must make our opinion quite clear in this regard .
we need a council president who can work with u effectively .
are you aware that the serious consequence of these decree are still valid ?
my second point is about the external action service .
that is all i have to say on president klaus .
however , the preparation for copenhagen are certainly not a game of poker .
it ha not taken on the leadership role in international climate protection .
instead , it is one of the major block to progress .
the financing for this international fund must be transparent .
we have been talking about this for two year , ever since bali .
the objective is to reduce co2 emission by 30 % by 2020 .
you should ensure that everything is in order before you go to copenhagen .
institutional theology is not the priority of the citizen of europe .
why can we never actually get result that matter to our citizen ?
and institutional change do not help with climate change .
we should at long last be dealing with specific issue of content .
the bank have , of course , been rescued .
this did not just relate to the social progress clause .
is it going to be tony blair with his empress cherie ?
well i have reached the conclusion that i want tony blair .
i hope that the train will enter the station very , very soon .
mr daul , we have very intensive contact with other player .
people all over the world are expecting u to do so .
in this regard , the treaty of lisbon is an important instrument .
so , what do we do in this case ?
the instrument of ratification of the uk are deposited in rome .
my second point concern supervision of the financial market .
therefore , if necessary , the council should make a political declaration .
this applies also to the european external action service .
furthermore , we need internal burden-sharing within the eu .
( fr ) mr president , i would like to ask three question .
firstly , there is the issue of climate change .
each country must agree to make an appropriate financial effort .
if we can not demonstrate solidarity , this will not work .
we are probably going to have a high representative .
they must propose a strategy that is not exclusively military .
if we do not do this , no one else will .
we must make europe more social , more environmentally friendly and more democratic .
europe is a community based on law , a democracy .
i would now like to return to my own topic .
these difference are apparent here in parliament a well .
these are absolutely clear barrier which should be systematically dismantled ...
we are presently living through the deepest crisis in europe 's economic history .
the objective must be the regulation of the financial market .
over-regulation , however , must not be allowed to prevent growth and employment .
for that reason , i am speaking today in italian .
i listened with great interest to mr barroso 's comment earlier .
it subsequently became the lisbon treaty , effectively the same document .
more than ten year of debate among the institution are enough .
for this reason , we should rapidly bring these debate to an end .
land regulation are exclusively a matter of national authority .
in this context , i would like to make another comment .
mr brok , you mentioned 10 year of debate about the lisbon treaty .
the european union must not play this dishonourable game .
now the banker will once again be receiving record salary .
the council president , the high representative or the commission president ?
my third comment , mr president , is a follows .
the democratic legitimacy of the new service also depends on it composition .
the geographic balance of the union should be taken into account .
so i say to my eurosceptic friend : 'get over it ' .
of course , we are all concerned about the czech republic .
if we hit out at him , it could well be counterproductive .
this brings me to my third point : the economic crisis .
another point i would like to discus is the ankara protocol .
i would like to mention two thing ahead of the european council summit .
the first point i would like to raise concern the climate .
this mean that pragmatism and result must take precedence .
i would like to highlight the importance of two thing .
i think that this is not the right solution .
the european council will also approve the baltic sea strategy .
the existing budget line need some money and some credibility .
( pt ) i would like to make two brief point .
copenhagen is our big opportunity to avoid catastrophe , a the scientist say .
we need a sense of ambition if we are to save the planet .
the union will be more open , more effective and more democratic .
properly organised migration can benefit all of the party involved .
( c ) mr president , the lisbon treaty is a key issue .
i doubt , however , that the president will end his obstruction .
what is really going on in the czech republic ?
( el ) mr president , my speech will concentrate on three point .
it is also clear that economic risk need to be europeanised .
the european union is rightly at the vanguard of global ecological diplomacy .
obviously we need to proceed more quickly in adopting a common immigration policy .
however , there are also foreign policy aspect to immigration .
i wish to say quite clearly that turkey 's stance is provocative .
i wa pleased to hear the swedish presidency point that out .
this framework form part of the community acquis and everyone must respect it .
i am referring to the air transport and shipping industry .
in all modesty , i would like to make a suggestion .
please ask the commission president to take a look at this issue .
i am sure both of you and many here share that view .
what is your opinion about 'gazpromians ' for the presidency ?
this number includes 75 million people who live in area bordering the danube .
therefore , i think that this would be a dangerous precedent .
secondly , it is wrong to cite the irish a an example .
therefore , their request did not encounter any legal obstacle .
however , we know that this issue is absolutely central .
recently we have , from time to time , witnessed intergovernmental drift .
why do we not refer to a structural crisis ?
( fr ) mr president , my question is very simple .
in june 2008 , the irish people voted against the lisbon treaty .
( ro ) mr president , my name is luhan , not luman .
we may each have different view on the treaty of lisbon .
there is still no solution with regard to the czech president .
however , i do agree with you that it is important .
mr van baalen , the issue of the ankara protocol is important .
therefore , i will certainly return to this issue again .
the same applies with regard to the 18 extra meps .
i hope that the preparation get underway a soon a possible .
their decision or delay will have an impact on all .
but i would say that we are facing a real challenge here .
a certain degree of creative thinking is necessary while respecting the interinstitutional balance .
we heard this particular theme evoked often during the debate .
i agree with those who said that there is no room for complacency .
political effort must also continue to support active labour market policy .
we hope that parliament will also confirm our ambition by your vote .
it also build on the important work done by the stoiber group .
we hope parliament will give it support to this .
it ha been criticised by many a not being enough .
nearly thirty-eight thousand people have signed a europe-wide petition opposing his presidency .
i share the revulsion of those opposed to mr blair 's presidency .
mr blair brought britain to the edge of ruin .
it is important to keep an ambitious negotiating position .
i would like to highlight one example : energy security .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
it seems pretty clear who is attacking freedom of opinion .
he ha based his analysis on the following principle .
secondly , they do not aim to delete or replace the entire text .
thus , the president ha decided that they are admissible .
i ask you to support this amendment in order to keep your credibility .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
this is the first thing i wish to say .
mr barroso said in response to this that it wa an internal matter .
jobbik will not allow such double standard to be applied in parliament .
my first two vote are abstention from the whole day 's vote .
( sv ) italy is part of the european cradle of democracy .
how this is achieved is not a matter for the eu .
only then can europe gain the confidence of the electorate .
we need to ensure that this is also the case in the future .
i also hope that everyone will be treated according to the same standard .
the socialist keep rather quiet about medium pluralism in these country .
freedom of the press is essential in a democratic society .
i regard the debate on the freedom of the press a very important .
they also scandalously attacked the president of the italian republic , giorgio napolitano .
this is because that government is disliked by the left .
the left is free to dislike the italian government .
freedom of expression is one of the value forming the basis of democracy .
however , this is not a problem which is specific to italy .
for this reason , i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
interference by the european parliament in this area is unacceptable .
we must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court .
european citizen should not be subject to medium censorship and selective news coverage .
think of newspaper such a la repubblica and of the entire left-wing press .
surely italian democracy deserves respect , like all the eu democracy .
however , it representative ha not shown himself worthy of it today .
if people think owner do not influence newspaper think again .
rupert murdoch owns almost 200 news outlet throughout the world .
only a minority of those had an anti-war stance on iraq .
this house must support freedom of speech and freedom of medium expression .
it is with regret that colleague on the right differed .
i am very pleased with the outcome of the vote .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
this is clearly laid down in the treaty of lisbon .
this is roughly a far a we have got in the discussion .
firstly , let me mention the status of the eeas .
indeed it will be sui generis a there is no model to follow .
this very much meet the wish expressed in the report .
in most place , this procedure will go quite smoothly .
the creation of an entirely new external service is a major undertaking .
it will , a your report say , evolve over time .
this report show that parliament will do the same .
for this reason , we have voted in favour of the brok report .
actually , institutional creation is not possible without political will .
the main thing is to adopt the report now .
i want to speak against the setting-up of a european diplomatic college .
we should act a guardian of the public purse .
some of our request aim to produce the same result .
that is pretty easy : democracy , democracy and democracy .
this parliament is based solely on kratos - purely on power .
for that reason , this report must be rejected .
with apology to mr shakespeare , methinks the report doth protest too much .
who or what will actually exercise any control over this body ?
national government will be reduced to the status of a parish council .
we are well aware that this report is not a definitive report .
therefore , it is only guideline that are being submitted to our parliament .
through him , we want a consistent and uniform foreign policy .
therefore , we have to be very careful and responsible during it setting-up .
it is therefore essential that the european parliament influence this process .
it is a lever with which the ep can exercise it power .
we should not forget about the human factor either .
today , we are experiencing a particularly important point in time .
secondly , we want the staff to be given comprehensive education and training .
simply having attended a diplomacy college is not enough .
therefore , the external action service should also be supported by this organisation .
parliament must exercise it right to scrutinise the eeas and shape it budget .
in fact , quite the opposite is the case .
we believe that there is a lack of control .
so what national interest will these new eu diplomat and embassy represent ?
already , british embassy around the world are selling off property .
i worked for the british government on the northern ireland peace process .
( de ) mr president , the council 's action are not transparent .
we need genuine democratic parliamentary control and we also need genuine transparency .
however , you are in favour of this treaty .
that is why they have to enjoy the same status .
we have failed so far to ensure that our policy are coherent .
often our trade policy conflict directly with our development cooperation policy .
to act otherwise would be to arouse the distrust of certain member state .
i am thinking in particular of the smallest and newest member state .
the external service must be wholly in step with the commission .
it must not drift off course to become or inspire intergovernmental action .
the question of coherence is central in this context .
for this reason , it make sense to establish a peacebuilding department .
this generates a lot of heat , but not much movement .
the citizen of europe want europe to speak with one voice .
the eeas will not be able to achieve this on it own .
however , it represents a step in the right direction .
who will the so-called ambassador of the european union be appointed by ?
this is something of vital importance that i can not emphasise enough .
i have in mind bruges , natolin , florence and maastricht .
i would also like to emphasise the issue of recruitment .
on this note , i would like to point out two thing .
it seems to me that there is a real risk of that happening .
i would therefore be interested in hearing your view on these matter .
a state ha an anthem and a flag , cooperation doe not .
we also hear about europe speaking with one voice .
this doe not make u paranoid , a those preaching tolerance are saying .
this would allow europe to truly speak with one voice .
it is sui generis so we have to find way to develop it .
of course , there are still issue to be resolved .
i hope it will get broad support in this parliament .
after the gaza conflict , it wa very important to obtain a ceasefire .
the situation should be the same in the future .
the statement that you have made belong to the past .
operational foreign policy must be the responsibility of the executive .
i believe that some action must be taken here .
the vote will take place on thursday , 22 october 2009 .
however , achieving these objective depends on how we organise this service .
the report contains a number of particularly important proposal .
this report is symptomatic of the militaristic nature of the european union .
one example is the following statement in the report :
the member state , however , are in a crucial position here .
the treaty of lisbon promised to bring about all sort of change .
however , referendum seem only to be held in order to be ignored .
in my opinion , the eeas should recruit candidate from all three source .
this will ensure it professionalism , effectiveness and unique character .
these are two important opportunity to strengthen our relation .
another important issue is , of course , the financial and economic crisis .
allow me now to say a few word about legal and police cooperation .
this statement must be meaningful and it must be followed by concrete measure .
an important example is the agreement on airline passenger data .
the list of area of cooperation is a long one .
this all requires joint and , to a certain degree , coordinated effort .
finally , i would like to mention three more point .
the first concern the protection of human right and fundamental freedom .
this must be counterbalanced by the fundamental and rigorous protection of personal data .
there is huge scope for cooperation in this area .
we are determined to promote these principle throughout the world .
the various measure within this cooperation can complement each other .
we also need to coordinate our technical assistance better .
that is also what our friend in washington expect .
now the preparation for the washington summit are in full swing .
now there is also a new transatlantic economic council ( tec ) .
a promising area in our transatlantic cooperation is what we call upstream cooperation .
it go without saying that we need such cooperation more than ever .
my colleague ha already mentioned that gls will also be very important .
this involves , in particular , the question of the legislator .
for this reason , the administration can not achieve this on it own .
there is one final comment i would like to make about the summit .
we must all ensure that copenhagen is a success .
it can only be successful if we have binding climate policy objective .
it also rightly reiterates the role of an integrated transatlantic market by 2015 .
president obama want to act , but he is blocked by his majority .
after all , the united state ha been our closest ally for year .
we must be united in defence of our security .
is this large deregulated market to be implemented by 2010 or 2015 ?
we can , and should , undertake many thing together .
we need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanism .
this is the right time to undertake such action .
we need regular meeting between official responsible for external affair and security .
the parliament also want two summit to take place every year .
this is why the green are in favour of a transatlantic new deal .
i am hoping for good result in this respect next week .
that , at least , is the view of my group .
however , we should not pretend to agree on everything .
first of all , however , trade is not really in danger .
madam president , i have a couple of point .
it is a very small operation , a we know .
we want to be amongst the leader for change .
we need to be the impetus for this change .
however , one important point - trade - is only touched on briefly .
i believe that international trade is a decisive factor .
this is a key issue in the eu-us summit 's success .
the economic partnership is a particularly important forum for u .
this is valuable in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism .
this wa clearly stated in the tec framework agreement of 30 april 2007 .
it would be important in guiding future work for the tec .
the focus of the energy council is on new technology and energy security .
the swift agreement is needed a it set out specific safeguard on data .
you can imagine that we do not want it .
the need to ensure respect for fundamental right is essential .
you can see that there is an enormous range of issue .
the vote will take place on thursday , 22 october 2009 .
the transatlantic economic council ha done good work so far .
the role of legislator in this relationship will be important .
this will be done by reducing barrier to trade .
the risk of a further 'credit crunch ' is not over .
the opportunity and perspective of nanotechnology are also a relevant subject .
one of these is the government of the republic of poland .
the next item is question time ( b7-0212/2009 ) .
the people of cuba do not enjoy freedom of speech and assembly .
access to information , including the internet , remains limited .
i do not see any dramatic change to this in the foreseeable future .
unfortunately , there ha been very little progress so far .
the conference brought together 160 people from 27 country .
it includes care in the home , institutional care and health care service .
unanimity in the council is required for the proposal to be approved .
thank you , president-in-office malmström , for your considered reply .
there are , however , some area where the eu can help .
one of them is in the whole area of the cross-border dimension .
president-in-office of the council . - i thank the member for that proposal .
it is the first time i have heard about this .
perhaps we could come back to this at a later stage .
( ro ) the european union ha an ageing population .
no one , apparently , ha left this prison alive .
so far , all attempt to have dawit isaak freed have been unsuccessful .
the eu should do more . isaak is also an eu citizen .
he is being held in prison without trial and without charge .
responsibility for this situation rest entirely with the eritrean government .
human right are a key element in relation between the eu and eritrea .
i also know that mr malmström is extremely committed to this matter .
it is nearly three year since we adopted the eu 's alcohol strategy .
the intention wa that it should be assessed by the summer of 2009 .
unfortunately , the assessment seems to have been postponed .
against this background , we have already held three major event .
in particular , consumption should be restricted for young people .
i am not aware of any ongoing discussion on price .
this is the convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context .
( lt ) thank you minister , for your truly comprehensive answer .
i can guarantee , honourable member , that sweden is doing that .
we must not make any political or economic judgment .
subject : elimination of barrier to the free movement of labour between member state
the free movement of labour is an important priority for the european union .
the movement of worker also help to reduce social marginalisation and poverty .
the council regularly review the question of transitional arrangement .
i am not sufficiently informed about the precise situation in austria .
i do not know if the problem are greater there than anywhere else .
the honourable member is , of course , aware of this .
turkey ha , of course , been informed of the operation .
mr morvai , you indicated you wanted the floor again .
( question 8 fell a the questioner wa absent )
subject : revision of regulation ( ec ) no 1/2005
the council naturally share the member 's concern regarding animal welfare .
i would ask you to concentrate , perhaps , on horse transport .
so would you take that into consideration when you are doing the review ?
i agree that sport and health go hand in hand .
sport activity also promote social cohesion , democracy and personal development .
the swedish presidency regard sport policy first and foremost a a national issue .
thank you also for your answer , which wa comprehensive .
thank you very much for that point of information .
problem of limited access of developing country to some vaccine ( debate )
generally speaking , new seasonal flu virus first appear in developing country .
the result is that the population of the south are unprotected against pandemic .
i think that is exactly what we should be focusing on .
i urge member to sign this and do something that matter .
( e ) thank you for your kind word , mr president .
the same applies to domestic demand and industrial production .
the european union ha an increasingly important influence in this process .
we are fully committed to supporting the country 's future development .
i strongly believe that moldova will receive assistance from a number of quarter .
this is why we support the commission 's effort .
we all agreed that the european union must provide financial support .
the new parliament must now choose it president wisely .
we are given too little time to ass such complex issue .
let u allow the reform-minded cabinet a political breathing space .
the name chosen by the government coalition is certainly no coincidence .
on a final note , moldova 's citizen require visa .
however , the parliament in chişinău is in a difficult position .
we can not afford to disappoint the moldovan people .
we can see progress in what moldova and it government are doing .
visa liberalisation should be negotiated and helped to happen .
romania and the republic of moldova have particularly close economic relation .
however , these exchange have been resumed following the removal of this scheme .
so far , not a single euro ha reached the republic of moldova .
almost all post-soviet system state firstly require a certain amount of financial support .
these gate need to be held open with financial aid .
we desperately need to provide immediate and urgent assistance .
this will then be reflected in the long term by stability and growth .
consequently , i will not go into detail on it result .
both georgia and russia are criticised for their action .
one key element is the proposal to establish stronger political and commercial relation .
we hope that the procedure can be finalised a soon a possible .
all our diplomatic and other action should never encourage udis or separatism .
there are , however , worrying sign of authoritarianism in georgia .
that wa the very big achievement of this report .
another thing is to ask what the eu will do now .
both ethnic georgian and other inhabitant are suffering in these area at present .
the report state that both side in the conflict violated international law .
of course there wa , and is , a winner : russia .
the georgian should be cautious in allowing the u to cover their back .
other main conclusion of the mission remain of global importance a well .
quick fix and xenophobia will never be a path to success .
it will be of utmost importance to have a presence there .
we will also continue to provide assistance to displaced person .
( the sitting wa suspended at 10.55 and resumed at 11.05 )
we have awarded this year 's prize to memorial .
this is how it wa in many country of central and eastern europe .
they are often 'ordinary ' people who show exceptional courage and dedication .
they often risk a great deal , even their life .
the prize giving ceremony will be on wednesday , 16 december in strasbourg .
draft general budget of the european union - 2010 financial year ( vote )
amendment 832 should , therefore , be adjusted accordingly .
i propose allocating this amount to the europe for citizen programme .
we have slightly different view but this is normal .
( ... ) so that we may proceed to the vote .
i therefore propose that we proceed to the vote .
how are the finance , what are the financial possibility ?
each body should respect it own custom , rule and regulation .
( e ) mr president , a technical error ha occurred .
we are making an exception for the reason outlined by the rapporteur ...
according to the service and in our view , this second amendment fall .
mr president , this is just to be helpful .
some of u have been hearing different number being called .
just in case there are any problem with u hearing or with communication .
it may be that i am reading the number too fast .
mr president , i rise very quickly and on a point of order .
i fully understand that , and so doe the house .
that is a great inconvenience to all of u .
adjustment of basic salary and allowance applicable to europol staff (
the institutional aspect of setting up the european external action service (
if they accepted it , i would recommend a 'yes ' vote .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
it make sense that amendment 70 should be put to the vote first .
and here we are spending more money in europe !
if this house take itself seriously , it must stop this practice .
however , i would have considered it wrong to vote against this .
doe it mean that we are not monitoring the market properly ?
we meps have been the one raising this issue for month on end .
we should learn lesson for the future from this .
half a loaf is better than no bread at all .
it mean rescinding law retrospectively , which undermines the principle of legal certainty .
at the moment , there are contradiction in the action of the commission .
we have to decide one way or the other .
it is cosying up to the tyrant in beijing and isolating taiwan .
it is refusing to talk to the anti-castro dissident in cuba .
it is trying to jolly the ayatollah out of their nuclear ambition .
let me repeat that the lisbon treaty should be put to a referendum .
now you look at what the eu is doing .
but there is one thing that we should remember .
it is time we put our own house in order .
we do not need to have a strategic eu-us partnership .
amendment 886 ha a commendable purpose - investment in sport .
however , this matter doe not belong at eu level .
such use is against the law in the uk .
therefore , conservative have voted to decrease many area of eu spending .
therefore , the ecr have voted to decrease many area of eu spending .
what is more , we are talking here about medium- and long-term measure .
however , there is an urgent need for short-term community measure .
in writing . - dairy farmer are under serious pressure right now .
this is not a sustainable situation for one of europe 's key industry .
these measure should stabilise milk price in the medium term .
however , this is little more than a drop in the ocean .
with this reservation , i voted in favour of parliament 's position .
i would point out that these are only foundation that have been laid .
si ii is a key political project for the entire union .
si ii is also a key element in combating crime and illegal immigration .
a united europe can not afford further delay and negligence .
we are , unfortunately , a long way from this contribution being made .
eu-us relation undoubtedly represent the eu 's most important strategic partnership .
for these reason , i have voted against this resolution .

the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on guinea .
mr president , guinea-conakry need the support of the international community .
following the death of president conté , a military junta seized power .
we call for the suspension of the european union fishery agreement .
keeping this military junta in power is not an acceptable option .
therefore i shall not go back over my speech .
my fellow member have already made a number of point .
the guinean regime is the most corrupt regime in the world today .
the committee on fishery ha already voted against such an agreement .
the european union must cease to provide this support .
mr president , we already talked about guinea two week ago .
nevertheless , the situation in the country deserves our continuing attention and response .
that is why i appeal to the european commission to act .
since it independence in 1958 , guinea ha only ever known dictatorial regime .
this is the biggest massacre since guinea 's independence in 1958 .
gang of soldier are regularly involved in attack , robbery and rape .
this is a fast-growing phenomenon in many armed conflict zone .
in all case , however , it is vulnerable people who are targeted .
that is why the epp is hesitant to support this suggestion .
i also wish to mention a point that wa emphasised before .
the next item is the debate on seven motion for resolution on iran .
with this resolution , parliament is sending out two separate message .
the situation ha even worsened since the june election .
arrest , torture and execution of minor and woman have increased .
one way is with the european instrument for democracy and human right .
so she had actually been excused the death penalty but wa subsequently hanged .
but we follow a policy of appeasement in the eu .
we are only bolstering the mullah when we continue this policy of appeasement .
he referred to the execution taking place in iran .
their determination , their commitment and their courage deserve our unreserved solidarity .
i find it scandalous that iran is trampling this right underfoot .
the iraqi government should stop following the order of the mullah in tehran .
since the election , the general human right situation ha become even worse .
secondly , freedom of religion and opinion are in a sorry state .
in iran , those who want no part in this fall into disfavour .
iran is a frightening country , particularly for the christian there .
nor is there any life in iran for demonstrator .
( lt ) the human right situation in iran is clearly deteriorating .
mr president , i fully agree with the comment of mr czarnecki .
unfortunately , there are only a few of u here .
a month ago , we debated the murder of journalist .
i know that many of you share my opinion .
let u find another - a better - date for this important debate .
more minor are likely to be executed shortly in iran .
the trial against those involved in these activity are continuing .
the 25-year civil war in sri lanka appears to be over .
critical article should stop being punished with prison sentence .
that would be a recipe for communal strife in the future .
i welcome the opportunity through this resolution to condemn it .
we would just like to record that these election are being organised .
to abolish the cause of violence , that is the real task .
it is easier to end a war than to create peace .
sri lanka ha still not joined the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mine .
the citizen of sri lanka deserve true democracy and a decent life .
now the country ha entered a hopeful , though critical , phase .
this highlight that sri lanka is currently not enforcing these convention .
we removed this item from our agenda during our joint negotiation .
i therefore recommend that this issue should be deleted here .
we shall certainly have an opportunity to discus this issue again another time .
i had asked the service to perhaps make this generally known once again .
the next item is the vote on six motion for resolution on guinea .
please could you point out that we have an agenda with separate item .
i assume that she will take note of your comment .

i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
formal sitting - 20th anniversary of the democratic change in central and eastern europe
from time to time , there are various difficulty with these country .
nonetheless , i believe that the west did the right thing .
we saw what that lead to in the former yugoslavia .
what we can offer to europe is the question , of course .
besides , europe ha it own unhappy experience of political appeasement .
collective sovereignty naturally arises from this sense of collective belonging .
the answer is clear : they should complement each other .
technical and economic development alone make this an absolute necessity .
this , too , ha to be patiently confronted .
the exporting of these value wa often accompanied by violence .
on the contrary , it emerged a the product of practical agreement .
integration ha therefore relocated from the battlefield to the conference hall .
i mentioned the increasing importance of supra-national structure in today 's world .
a relationship such a that is based on falsehood .
if only this attempt could be an example to others !
it is a movement that is perhaps slowly getting under way already .
indistinct or disputed boundary are a frequent source of disaster .
the european council currently comprises an odd combination of executive and representative authority .
i am not advocating anything revolutionary , epoch-making or radical here .
it is twenty year since europe 's rift wa healed .
let u therefore do everything possible to ensure that they are not forgotten .

on this occasion , a machine can not replace me .
( the sitting wa suspended at 16.05 and resumed at 16.15 )
let me explain the situation on the eve of the european council .
we were in constant contact with prague and other capital .
how would we solve the czech request regarding the charter of fundamental right ?
given these circumstance , i am satisfied with the outcome of the meeting .
a final figure will be determined in the light of the copenhagen conference .
our unity gave u the credibility to encourage others .
last week 's meeting wa also about the economic and financial situation .
at the european council , we made significant progress on strengthening financial supervision .
we reached broad agreement on the establishment of a european systemic risk board .
the presidency will now begin to discus the proposal with this parliament .
we want to reach agreement on a package for a new supervisory structure .
it is up to u to change this trend .
i know that you also want to discus institutional matter this afternoon .
they were , of course , an important element of the discussion .
this mean that the lisbon treaty will enter into force on 1 december .
we need to fill the position created by the lisbon treaty .
we need , together with you , to appoint a new commission .
nevertheless , you and i know that much remains to be done .
i can promise you that the coming week will be very busy .
the copenhagen meeting is actually now only 25 day away .
i am grateful for the continuing support from this parliament .
frankly , the european council result exceeded my initial expectation .
the same is true of others , like china .
in the end , it is content that matter more than form .
in fact , the commission is working on it implementation .
but now we have to complete the task of transition .
that is obviously also true for the high representative .
this brings me to the commission a a whole .
i have asked member state to come forward with name , including woman .
then it will be for me to decide on portfolio .
i also want to have a commission with a strong democratic mandate .
the delay due to the treaty have given u a common challenge .
that brings me back to the beginning of our afternoon .
once again , what do our fellow citizen want ?
what count are the quantified commitment made by the state .
this obligation concern , first and foremost , the economic recovery and employment .
we now need to take decision with regard to people .
i do not envy you this task , mr reinfeldt .
are you also prepared to ensure a stronger representation of woman , perhaps ?
is that the image that represents europe to it people today ?
we will need to be very careful and conscientious in giving that approval .
you rightly mentioned unemployment , which is also set to rise further .
there is also the debate about the financial transaction tax .
we need to send out clear signal in this regard .
they are speculating in the name of god , to put it bluntly .
nothing else is really being done transparently , i must say !
those are the three key element that characterise this figure .
mr reinfeldt , my group ha three opinion to voice on this issue .
they are simply opinion , since it is the council that will decide .
fortunately , however , parliament can give opinion and can do so openly .
next , it must be performed by someone who belief in european integration .
it is the community method that drive europe forward , not governmentalism !
it is the community method that the president of the council must defend .
everyone know that , even at an international level .
mr havel also received a great deal of applause for this .
climate protection and economic development are actually two side of the same coin .
the greatest challenge facing the world is climate change .
climate protection , peace and combating poverty are just such challenge .
and i say this despite senhor barroso 's comment on partnership .
however , it is rather different for the new high representative .
that is actually what ha been put into the treaty .
this wa supposed to already be in place before the swedish presidency .
it is a much lengthier process than anyone could foresee .
that is what we have been trying to do .
there were comment on who is taking this decision .
it take a little while just to consult everyone .
this reflects the view of many of my colleague .
i welcome country- or nation-based decision which have gone further .
first of all , regarding climate change , let u be clear .
the european union is committed to a binding treaty .
we have been committed to the kyoto protocol and have ratified it .
i believe it is still possible , and we will fight for it .
the most important thing , however , is precisely respect for the treaty .
i believe that it is a mistake to act in that way .
i believe that institutional jealousy is a characteristic shared by mediocre individual .
if we do not have institution that work , what will happen ?
we have heard today the extraordinary plea made by václav havel .
thank you , mr reinfeldt ; thank you , cecilia .
why must the president of the council be a prime minister ?
this pessimism is also evident in the conclusion from the last council meeting .
his position is badly designed from a democratic point of view .
i believe that transparency is necessary for the forthcoming appointment .
this is a danger that we must guard against .
my view is that these obstacle can not be free of charge .
this could not be done under the charter of fundamental right .
however , allow me to make a few comment on the current debate .
only the president of the commission ha full legitimacy .
the external action service will play a decisive role in this regard .
we need inspired and competent people to enhance it .
therefore , unavoidably , it ha a lot of ambiguity and gap .
my fellow member can not fail to share my opinion .
this is exactly what is happening now , despite all our well-intentioned resolution .
besides , herman van rompuy doe not actually govern a prime minister .
we must have the political will to transpose and implement the treaty .
the press is reporting the protocol a being an opt-out from the charter .
thing look similar with regard to the european union minister for foreign affair .
please tell mr barroso this , on my behalf .
it is our shared responsibility to highlight this fact .
precisely the same thing happened when we negotiated the climate target .
it is exactly the same with the climate package .
on the third issue , the treaty of lisbon , we are satisfied .
it is not only the institution and the treaty that are important .
i think that 2010 may be a great year for europe .
i would like to mention two thing that i consider to be essential .
europe need a louder voice that is more united and stronger .
( sv ) mr president , the swedish presidency is to be congratulated .
mr president , i would like to make three observation .
only such policy can prevent schröder-putin deal from ever being repeated .
václav havel told u today that europe is a homeland of our homeland .
lastly , on strong institution , mr barroso is absolutely right .
you need to hear what we are saying in this parliament .
the european union ha already assumed unilaterally the '20-20-20 ' objective .
i think we should also look at the title .
well done on what you have done so far .
the fall of the wall marked the start of the real europe .
that would , of course , require the consent of all 27 country .
this , of course , could easily be repealed by subsequent government .
it is difficult , but it is his goal .
he ha already invited them to a working dinner next thursday .
it is too premature to speculate about the name yet .
we do see light at the end of the tunnel .
finally , on climate change , we have not lowered our ambition .
the swedish presidency , the commission and many others work day and night .
i deplore it , but it is a fact .
the aim is to replace kyoto with a binding agreement .
we have confirmed the commission 's estimate and are backing them .
we have a working group looking at the internal burden-sharing .
so , we will spend every waking minute working on this .
we are at a turning point in european history .
this is the biggest test so far of the 21st century .
a a result , around 230 000 people met a tragic death .
claim for compensation could be made during this window of opportunity .
mr barroso will soon be assigning portfolio to the new commissioner .
i trust parliament will not have to intervene again .
this , unfortunately , is overt promotion of discrimination against woman .
eu-russia summit on 18 november 2009 in stockholm ( debate )
we have a lot to gain from cooperation with russia in all area .
that mean respect for human right , democracy and the rule of law .
one of the most important issue will be climate change .
we will , of course , discus the economic and financial crisis .
obviously , we will not deviate from our fundamental principle .
the g20 commitment were an important step in the right direction .
i think it is important that they are now upheld by all partner .
a tendency to protectionist practice is already hurting eu business .
on energy security , work continues on an enhanced early warning mechanism .
we also both face threat in the form of international terrorism and fundamentalism .
a country like iran is a challenge for both the eu and russia .
unfortunately , we had to award the sakharov prize to a russian organisation .
my thanks to the presidency for it clarity in this regard .
in the caucasus , we must jointly demand unrestricted access for eu observer .
i think that the medvedev initiative should not be immediately rejected .
that is something we should provide , if it is a genuine request .
for that reason , we must not create any unnecessary obstacle .
where critical journalist are murdered , the truth also dy .
we are not making any progress with our 'change through trade ' approach .
the rising nostalgia for the soviet union and stalin is also very worrying .
do we want the negotiation to assist cooperation between the eu and russia ?
italy happens to be a member state of the union .
so what are we hoping to achieve in russia ?
hungarian were among the greatest victim of this dictatorship .
russia is obviously our extremely important economic and strategic partner .
the european union speaks out against human right violation .
at the last sitting , we discussed the us-eu summit .
these question influence those relation and , in fact , define them .
we have the issue of gas supply to european citizen .
yet can it really be right that we reward russia for this ?
or do you merely intend to let thing carry on a they are ?
do you actually want to reward this negative development ?
the usa flattens iraq and this place fawn on them .
but for russia , there are only pompous and hypocritical lecture .
we must continue to work on the other three space a well .
i have already mentioned the importance of russia a a global player .
this is the conclusion which we must draw from recent year .
( pl ) madam president , russia deserves to be treated seriously .
where do we have the opportunity for success in this area ?
indeed , while chatting about energy , we are selling our future .
that is not happening , at least not to a sufficient degree .
i am therefore very much in favour of the nabucco pipeline .
for u romanian , energy security mean security in the black sea region .
europe 's energy policy may be affected by unresolved conflict in this region .
russia must cooperate with the european union in this region of maximum interest .
i have no time for that kind of talk .
you may not have been present this afternoon , when president havel spoke .
mr malmström also referred to this , for which i thank her .
madam president , thank you for a very constructive debate .
however , it is a valuable opportunity to meet and to talk .
we need to cooperate with regard to conflict settlement in our common space .
it is about identifying specific issue where both party will benefit from cooperation .
this is , so to say , the general line .
now let me say a few very specific thing .
they have always been mentioned at the many summit i have been on .
the second item i want to mention is energy .
this is what we are aiming for , particularly in our new agreement .
with regard to human right , i did speak about human right .
we have spoken about human right whenever we have been at the summit .
let u hope that this will indeed be true .
these are always discussed in our eu-russia human right consultation .
that is also an area of enormous economic potential .
i think again that the scope of our relationship is enormous .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 12 november 2009 .
gas supply to europe can not depend on conflict between russia and ukraine .
the eu must speak with a single voice on the nabucco project .
we are not getting involved with competition between project .
we are not talking about nord stream versus south stream .
second is information and access to procedure through electronic technology .
it is vital that we have full and complete system set up .
so that is what our question is here tonight .
we know you will give our best wish to charlie mccreevy from everybody .
we want the benefit and we want them now .
of course , this is quite difficult for the member state to organise .
political support for this is , of course , very important .
however , it will take time to put this in place .
lastly , parliament asks how the interested stakeholder have been involved .
but the commission can not carry out the implementation at national level .
let me now reply in more detail to your question .
business and consumer need to be aware of the applicable rule .
but a you know , this is not mandatory under the directive .
indeed , some member state are already planning to do so .
but we had better keep filling it and quickly .
the same applies to the scope of the directive .
lady and gentleman , the president is asking me to be quick .
i would like to come to my last point .
that is a major problem and it is very disappointing .
a period of three year ha been allowed for it implementation .
we are doing this , for example , by subsidising the motor industry .
they do need , however , freedom to do their work .
regulation and reality - if only they were in agreement .
i know of the example of a bakery built in a neighbouring country .
if only this type of practice were never employed .
i hope the outcome of these effort will be satisfactory .
it ha , in fact , fostered competition and innovation .
so , what ha been proposed today is something i support 100 % .
we have had several discussion in different council formation .
a question wa asked about how the contact point would function .
the question put to me by my swedish colleague is a swedish issue .
the commission will still be watching this very closely .
greater use of the single market ha become possible .
the next item is the debate on the oral question to the council on
the author , herbert reul , ha indicated that he is running late .
if he arrives , he may be given the floor at the end .
i should like to point out that we have drafted a resolution .
research today show that there are already initiative aimed at pre-diagnosis .
article 165 accord with the objective for joint programming initiative .
you are , of course , familiar with the commission 's proposal .
neurodegenerative disease pose a major health problem in europe .
this is a problem which ha a number of different aspect to it .
the commission 's proposal focus on the research-related aspect .
unfortunately , there is a lot of duplicated research and bureaucracy in europe .
essentially , there is a problem with regard to european patent .
however , i am happy that we are moving forward .
it is not the time for an interinstitutional dispute .
i am happy that the council is prepared to move .
the member state have been developing research effort in this field .
it wa said then that the eu should take action in this matter .
( de ) madam president , i will be very brief .
the importance of this ha already been stated by several speaker .
it is a disease that affect many people and that number is growing .
madam president , alzheimer 's and other dementia-related disease are dreadful .
the illness also involves the suffering of close relative .
the social impact is enormous and take a heavy toll .
in october 2009 , the social democratic party quit the government .
we must avoid being drawn into excessive bureaucratic interference .
however , irish worker and community activist are fighting back .
this wa the case until the eu got itself involved .
the geneva treaty should also be updated and improved .
the remaining cemetery have been invaded by bulldozer with excavator digging up relic .
in order to achieve this , we need to increase plant cover .
firstly , what is the relationship between the risk and benefit ?
i therefore think that more harmonisation may be required .
forgive me for raising a pressing matter recently brought to my attention .
is it true that this proposition mean a substantial reduction in regional fund ?
it would affect the majority of the eu 's 271 region .
sadly , the consequence of these crime are devastating and long-lasting .
doe the european commission intend to make the european union pay this debt ?
i should have given the floor to mr teixeira .
i probably pronounced your name wrongly and that caused the confusion .
( pt ) the current economic crisis lead to job insecurity .
we are still very far from having planned half of the available fund .
all the country are affected , some even more so than others .
i therefore appeal to the national management authority to get involved .
it is time we spent money for europe more effectively .
naturally , i am talking about bosnia and herzegovina and albania .
i would like to conclude by thanking mr fajon , the rapporteur .
we exhort them to meet the benchmark a soon a possible .
we know that the commission is helping in that process .
there are no short cut . there is no abracadabra .
it definitely doe not send any strong political message .
to my friend there , i am saying that i am committed .
i would like to know what you think about this .
we need to overcome the anxiety in our population .
criminal are everywhere - they do not need a visa !
that is therefore not something that we should be concerned about .
i hope that mr barrot will help u in that .
it must not be the last remaining black mark .
we are obliged to help kosovo to meet the benchmark .
now we have to use it to deal with the western balkan .
it is not only about providing a message of trust and visa-free travel .
this is an embarrassing distinction in view of the country 's recent history .
this responsibility also mean action at the same time .
we can not , however , allow our eastern neighbour to be isolated .
you made it clear that freedom of movement wa obviously very desirable .
we are talking about the destiny of the young generation .
the issue of providing visa-free travel is only partially a technical one .
visa-free travel is based on mutual trust and commitment .
it also concern bosnia and herzegovina , albania and kosovo .
latvia wa at risk of going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside .
we received such assistance from the eu and the imf .
the approach , a you see , wa an egalitarian one .
is the commission not aware of the european year against poverty ?
the latvian situation is not unique in the union .
other country may one day be forced to apply for such loan .
we must therefore avoid creating a precedent of accepting antisocial measure .
this mean that everything the institution do must be measured against social right .
why have these three country had to ask for assistance ?
the european union doe not make fund available without condition .
all of this will only make the crisis , unemployment and poverty worse .
only harmonised and effective action will produce result on an eu-wide scale .
people have the smallest reserve then in these country .
that ha been said a couple of time already .
on 24 april of this year , the european parliament repeated this request .
they are setting out to destroy our education system .
what is our alternative , then , a representative of european citizen ?
job loss are the main concern of european citizen .
however , the political crisis ha disrupted the negotiation process .
a václav havel said this morning , we can not have double standard .
here , we are all democrat and , therefore , fighter for freedom .
let u not allow ourselves to be blinded by our ideological preference .
the election of 29 november can not be recognised .
we are concerned about the numerous human right violation being reported to u .
now more than ever europe must take a firm stance on democracy .
if the conflict continues , the time will have to come for sanction .
the european union must demand the unconditional and immediate reinstatement of president zelaya .
we have had example of this in europe in the past .
the election in poland in 1989 are an example .
the election provide opportunity and hope for the amendment of these error .
i am sure that we want this to happen .
the election can be decisive and positive for a democratic honduras .
the european union support this process and is pleased with it .
the current situation in honduras is temporary , and can not last long .
i condemn this military coup in the strongest term .
it is unacceptable that this parliament ha not yet condemned the coup d'état .
mr president , presidential election in honduras were called 16 month ago .
the agreement contained a set of key point supported by both side .
no election have been held there for 50 year .
we must make fresh urgent call for peace and dialogue .
i am grateful to the commission for taking precisely this position .
that i will take back and will deliberate on with colleague .
a i said , this is a poor country .
'made in ' ( origin marking ) ( debate )
origin marking should therefore be considered in that spirit .
a number of member state remain to be convinced .
i sincerely hope this will clear the way for a compromise solution .
however , i think that the list could be made longer .
it could also favour the small and medium-sized industry of europe .
at the same time , ten of thousand of job are disappearing .
i would say that mandatory origin marking is a clear example of this .
the third myth is that the marking increase european competitiveness .
however , new technical barrier to trade do not protect european industry .
could the commissioner perhaps address that point for me please ?
i think even adam smith wa quoted in that .
those concept go hand in hand , and i would agree with that .
specifically , mr schlyter asked me about the expanding of the list .
mr arif said that we should not water this down .
we are looking at the whole euromed issue a well .
it is about saying that we need to move forward .
there wa a concern that that would be expensive .
the vote will take place during the next part-session .
defending each country 's right to sustainable production is a future requirement .
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
the european ombudsman 's activity ( 2008 ) ( debate )
an unprecedented number of inquiry wa completed in 2008 .
the most common type of maladministration wa lack of transparency .
one third of case were settled amicably to the satisfaction of the complainant .
i enjoy an excellent working relationship with the committee .
they must also act consistently and in good faith .
unlike court ruling , an ombudsman 's decision are not legally binding .
in addition , a new six-page overview ha been produced .
let me briefly mention just two of these case .
the commission wa constructive throughout the procedure concerning a payment dispute .
in 2008 , the ombudsman registered a total of 3 406 complaint .
this represents a 6 % increase compared to 2007 .
a very important initiative in this area came to fruition earlier this year .
it will come a no surprise that i totally agree with that .
i believe it is a result that citizen will benefit from .
a you know , 66 % of the enquiry focused on the commission .
such figure need to be brought down by all institution .
recently , we have seen some difficulty in relation to competition file .
here i want to commend the ombudsman on his new website .
just like the annual report , it is thorough , complete and user-friendly .
the work should not be duplicated , but be given enhanced visibility .
the fact remains that the commission is the guardian of the treaty .
moreover , the ombudsman serf a a resource for the institution .
this repeated call by our committee must not remain unanswered .
i would also like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
the report is clear , concise and to the point .
that say a lot and the matter need to be addressed .
mr president , my thanks to mr paliadeli for a splendid report .
this is something that we previously received parliament 's support for in principle .
it seems to me that our institution need supervision .
otherwise , the democratic deficit will , unfortunately , become wider .
we know that they are nothing of the sort .
many thanks , mr diamandouros , for your work with our fellow citizen .
you can count on our support to promote and facilitate your work .
one of their main point of criticism is the bologna process .
scholasticism , however , is anything but a plannable process .
( the president reminded the speaker of her speaking time )
a far a i am concerned , they are legitimate cost .
they are incurred in doing our job on behalf of citizen .
the situation is no different for other member state .
the european parliament is therefore proposing an extensive information campaign .
each case taken on therefore cost more than eur 10 000 .
in this respect , i would like to wish the ombudsman much success .
lady and gentleman , i do not propose to drown you in number .
once again , i congratulate you on your report .
( hu ) the european ombudsman ha done an outstanding job .
this is an extremely important and serious problem in europe .
the ombudsman 's priority must be to prevent maladministration .
the second challenge will be to continue promoting transparency within the european institution .
a such , the role of the european ombudsman is crucial and decisive .
i travel extensively throughout the member state at all time .
this very area is one that the treaty of lisbon could have tackled .
even an ombudsman is of little help to second class citizen .
your committee on budget ha adopted these proposal by a very large majority .
the rapporteur ha identified the right issue to be discussed in his report .
we social democrat in particular have put forward a few opinion .
moreover , national parliament also have such an instrument .
it is possible to make change during the year .
only then can we make the european union fit for the future .
we should therefore have no need for transitional guideline on budgetary matter .
yet we can not go along with the present report .
this strike me a a golden opportunity for the rapporteur .
these temporary hut are still in operation even today .
with this hope , i ask everyone to support this proposal .
in this report , you welcome the existence of the treaty of lisbon .
it is thus a constitution : financially , politically and legally .
we were right and our struggle for sovereignty will continue here .
equally important is the simplification of the budget procedure .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i wish to remind you that you have an opportunity to vote .
the idea is that everyone can watch these film in the european union .
i am therefore asking you to take part in this vote .
i would now like to read the text of the declaration .
mr corazza bildt , i fully understand what you are saying .
eu - russia summit on 18 november 2009 in stockholm ( vote )
let u fill that accidental gap with a clear mind .
joint programming of research to combat neurodegenerative disease ( vote )
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
for me , that is not the ombudsman 's concern .
i wish the delegation a continued enjoyable stay in the european union .
there remains the unsolved question of kosovo and albania .
albania and bosnia have to catch up with macedonia , montenegro and serbia .
the slovenian presidency decided to begin negotiation in 2008 .
i agree that we can not set precedent by lowering the agreed criterion .
i also argue in favour of medium-term solution for kosovo .
the report also includes dialogue with kosovo regarding it inclusion in this process .
i fully back the amendment tabled on behalf of my own group .
thus , there is still no eu common position on this subject .
the free movement of person must be a fundamental right in europe .
the european microfinance facility need to have a separate budget line .
i have therefore voted in favour of this resolution .
there are , however , certain area that require reinforcement .
i hope the other european institution will follow it example .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the resolution on russia .
i therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
russia should understand that this project is not directed against russia .
the assassination of maksharip aushev highlight the brutality that unfortunately meet protest .
negotiation , which began last year , are currently underway with russia .
dementia is a huge issue throughout europe affecting million of individual and family .
around 7 million people in europe suffer from neurodegenerative disease .
this is why concerted action at eu level is important .
the knowledge that citizen have about what the ombudsman doe is generally limited .
cooperation between the european ombudsman and eu institution must be improved .
this would be an invaluable aid to the citizen of eu member state .
at the moment , most people have problem with this .
this is why i voted in favour of mr lamassoure 's report .
clearly , that view would not be completely mistaken .
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
next week , on 1 december , it will be world aid day .
it adoption wa a consequence of the event of the second world war .
the declaration wa adopted unanimously , and it is worth stressing this .

oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
incidentally , the same thing wa said at the g8 summit in l'aquila .
we are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue .
the language law is just one such sad , small chapter .
i invite all member to support this group in their political party .
however , romanian in italy are facing similar censure almost every day .
but i am no longer convinced by any of these explanation .
our action foster the growth of radical , anti-western islamic belief .
it extends and consolidates the monopoly held by gdf suez until 2025 .
this irish government ha no democratic mandate for it savage programme of cut .
international law provision are applied quite differently in different state .
one-minute speech on matter of political importance ( continuation )
we now continue with the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
in addition to this , 400 job are currently at risk in austria .
this is not what we are trying to achieve .
we request that it be communicated to the european commission and the council .
today , the french mistral-type helicopter carrier arrived in st petersburg .
this is an excellent example of the benefit of the european union .
this is shameful for the whole of the european union !
subsequently , in october 2009 , 1 192 people received redundancy notice .
soon , around 2 500 people are to be deported per year .
these measure particularly affect 10 000 rom , but also egyptian and ashkali .
their prospect involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted mitrovica .
a certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case ...
the whole european union ha a responsibility to do something about this .
in this age of information technology , information spread between people very quickly .
i am referring in particular to the republic of moldova .
that is of paramount importance and must be done .
i believe that the european parliament must speak out on this .
in any event , these were inconceivably grisly killing .
let u take a moment to remember ulrika barklund larsson .
the reform will also permit investment by operator in the next-generation network .
unfortunately , we did not reach a compromise on this point .
tomorrow 's vote , however , is only the beginning .
for u , a simple declaration on net neutrality is not enough .
you may perhaps wish to comment on that later .
mr president , the telecom package will be decided on tomorrow .
there are three reason why i will be voting against this package .
freedom of expression should not be decided by the european court of justice .
the result is something of which parliament can be proud .
here , too , an important prerequisite ha been met .
limitation should only be introduced after a fair and independent process .
this is an amendment that could not be foreseen at the beginning .
so i encourage all colleague to vote 'yes ' to it .
the entire package , a it now stand , is exceptionally well balanced .
on the other hand , it make particularly good provision for consumer protection .
this is a pièce de résistance of the art of negotiation .
initially , however , the council wa not prepared to go that far .
accepting restriction on digital freedom and going against net neutrality is not acceptable .
the issue of internet freedom ha been discussed rigorously and in great depth .
i would like to thank everyone who took part in the debate .
where doe that information end up , and for what purpose ?
mr van nistelrooij said we are writing communication history here this evening .
it is an entirely foreign element in the package .
to my mind , this is another splendid example of policy laundering .
it should be taken a an important case study in parliament 's work .
that is that and that should be applied now in the member state .
so i am very proud of the european institution .
i think that they have managed to make a good piece of legislation .
here in this text , we have managed to bring both together .
congratulation to all those who have contributed to make this possible .
we have not succeeded on this point a we have on others .
this legal provision applies to both the authority and to internet provider themselves .
τhe next item is the joint debate on the following report :
i will read his view a rapporteur to you .
i basically endorse the proposal made by the previous speaker .
of course , we support the development of europol .
only in this way can europol 's work enjoy sufficient legitimacy .
what is more , there is every reason to do so .
this ha produced a very dangerous imbalance in one area in particular .
that is precisely what eu citizen now expect from u .
the compulsory control by the european parliament is inalienable .
this network wa set up in 2001 by council decision 2001/427/jha .
in 2005 , the network underwent it first internal structural reform .
the evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network .
crime prevention can not be reduced to the exchange of best practice .
regarding the procedural matter , i fully understand parliament 's position .
the treaty of lisbon is just about to enter into force .
it is also true that the commission somewhat regret this situation .
i now come to the matter of forensic laboratory .
stricter accreditation of these laboratory will lead to increased public confidence .
again , i am aware of the problem with the legal basis .
i shall now move on to the european union crime prevention network .
naturally , we believe that crime must be prevented .
coercive measure are not enough to reduce crime and organised crime .
prevention is vital , be it at local or cross-border level .
mr alfano , you have just pointed out the weakness of the network .
we are clearly at the start of a major new crime prevention policy .
judicial cooperation in the european union is a matter of great importance .
i refer here to our framework for forensic laboratory .
that is the reality : we have a problem .
i think that it is good for europol to work with them .
furthermore , i also regret that the council is not here today .
this will probably also be the case at eu level .
in my opinion , we should stop this attack on data protection .
i am sure that they will be taken into account .
we are not rejecting the proposal of the council and the commission .
rather , we want to take part in the decision-making process .
that is the crucial point , in term of our vote .
it is of the utmost importance that it function are expanded further .
we need this in order to successfully combat terrorism and crime .
the decision that this network wa necessary wa made 10 year ago .
i am thinking , for instance , of mafia crime .
it would be very difficult to interrupt europol 's work .
it would be a shame to somehow interrupt europol 's work .
it is a positive result and a step forward .
i think it is the presidency that stand indicted tonight for their absence .
i just want to make a couple of point .
there is no way that can be held to be acceptable .
that is the reality a far a i see it .
it ha to become an agency by 1 january .
it could have started the procedure much earlier than the end of july .
it is not about the european parliament being sidelined .
it is not even about the national parliament being sidelined .
we should , however , consider what is least defined .
what is most uncertain in the decision is control by the european parliament .
this is the 'a ' in this abc , mr president .
we can not accept the council washing it hand of the matter either .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for their work .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 24 november 2009 .
use of information technology for custom purpose ( debate )
for many people , this is a terribly technical topic .
this view is certainly not reflected in all political group in this house .
in this context , i would like to make the following comment .
other than that , i have nothing more to add .
now we have to decide whether we support this request or not .
under the current treaty rule , we are merely consulted .
this is clearly the case for the country we are examining today .
such a framework regulation could potentially have significant advantage .
this is why i welcome these proposal for macro-financial assistance .
a key matter is the granting of financial assistance in 2009 .
therefore , i evaluate the commission proposal a constructive and good .
however , the level of financial support is significantly too low .
we are doing our utmost to support our neighbourhood country .
you always have to strike a balance between achieving objective and following procedure .
it is important to follow clear rule in providing this assistance .
for this reason , it should also be helped .
i believe that this initiative is part of the european neighbourhood policy .
( the sitting wa suspended at 21.10 and resumed at 21.20 )
firstly , who should chair our delegation to cosac ?
in fact , parliament ha really acquired a large number of right .
obviously , there are many reform that fit in with this idea .
it is worth pointing out this fact at this stage .
rule of procedure should be established according to a broad consensus .
other proposal for amendment must be discussed in greater depth .
we will have sufficient time to do so in this house .
however , urgent matter must be addressed without delay .
( de ) mr president , democracy need a revolution .
i am referring to article 192 ( 1 ) .
two month later , you responded and merely repeated the paragraph .
in this respect , the rule of procedure must be changed .
however , we will find a solution to this problem .
this is only a technical question and nothing more .
mr president , i stand before you a a democrat .
it is something that should be decided by the meps themselves .
i have a feeling that the empire is striking back .
that is why i am completely in favour of the proposal .
may you make the right decision , and may we all see it .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 2009 .
preparation of the copenhagen summit on climate change ( debate )
that must be one of the result of copenhagen .
now there are just two week left before the climate summit in copenhagen .
we need to reach an ambitious and comprehensive agreement in copenhagen .
there is now talk of a 'two stage solution ' .
it will also be crucial in u achieving the two degree target .
our 30 % shall also continue to be used a a leveraging tool .
we are now waiting in particular for the u and china .
an agreement in copenhagen must cover all of the world 's emission .
in other word , we must go beyond 2° celsius .
spain , australia and norway have improved their commitment .
it is now clear that measure by developed country alone will not suffice .
our fundamental objective in copenhagen is still to achieve a legally binding agreement .
within this framework , funding is a decisive factor .
it wa so interesting that it wa not possible to stop it !
president obama is not yet able to keep his election promise .
europe must take it fair share of this responsibility .
we know that global climate protection is not possible without financing .
we need eur 5 to 7 billion straight away .
this really ha to deserve a major effort from u all , therefore .
i also note that some country are moving , but others are not .
without these two country and without india , there will be no agreement .
the position of we european must be clear , unambiguous and extremely robust .
it concern the future of the entire human race .
eu leadership is now crucially important , a before .
we need to take advantage of this opportunity and raise our sight .
i would also like to thank him for emphasising the importance of funding .
instead , they are simply making fine-sounding declaration of intent and empty promise .
we must maintain the diversity of the biosphere for future generation .
and , of course , this must be science-based .
for the 30 % reduction , i have to add the following .
it is not only green industry that we have , of course .
we therefore need to develop a completely different focus .
i am absolutely astonished about the financing - it is a number race .
please , commissioner , can you give me some reassurance on that front ?
the developing country must be included , with adapted figure and target .
that is an indicator of the urgency of what we are dealing with .
and that is before the effect of climate change really hit u .
i think that is something that is lacking in the public debate .
i know that this is not the fault of these two gentleman .
it will not lead to our industry becoming uncompetitive .
we have to ensure that our science is put to the fore .
the ambition could not have been reinforced more strongly .
i welcome the fact that the european union ha given such leadership .
we have four week and negotiation have a momentum of their own .
now , is this a shift in our negotiating position ?
she bought a bunch of greenhouse flower , wrapped in plastic .
we can not leave it at a pathetic pittance .
we must leave behind the urge to move only if somebody else doe .
ambition is one thing , but taking responsibility is what really matter .
we must be careful to avoid falling into that trap .
we should approach the conference with optimism but also realism .
can mr carlgren promise to give u clear information before copenhagen ?
let them surpass themselves and look beyond economic interest in the short term .
that is not acceptable , that is not serious .
usd 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050 .
is it perhaps because greenland wa once green when the world wa hotter ?
on the contrary , optimism is based on acknowledging reality .
if my information is correct , it is a follows .
environmental action is only possible in a healthy economy .
only if the economy is healthy can we invest in the environment .
thing will not go well with the present target percentage .
support for the left is melting away faster than the iceberg .
when it come to technology , we must remain impartial .
in conclusion , i wish to send out a clear message .
we have to act and we have to do so immediately .
( nl ) i should like to discus the transport aspect .
i think that we can go even further in this regard .
achieving success , of course , is even better .
in other word , why have we failed to galvanise sufficient political will ?
so my message to you is : please , be more ambitious .
let u consider why it will not be a success .
maybe it is not just certain cow that have gone mad .
i am deeply concerned with the wto talk starting this week .
there is a clear remit for what is to be achieved .
what are the consequence , including for european industry ?
another member also pointed out that our contribution is 10 % .
with this objective in mind , we are working on a common response .
2007 wa a decisive year , because we set out our precise objective .
the committee on industry , research and energy ha made a significant contribution .
it wa very symbolic , but delivered no reduction in emission .
thirdly , politics must take note of a debate emerging in science .
this is why educational work is also so important .
copenhagen should give rise to more than a mere declaration of intent .
european leader have great ambition for the negotiation in copenhagen .
europe must not be naive with regard to china and india .
what that mean is that climate protection doe cost money .
we must push on with our activity in this regard .
we need to adopt this resolution , which ha three noble aspiration .
let u not give in too quickly to pessimism .
we must now turn our rhetoric into genuine political will .
the state will have to commit themselves in copenhagen !
we european ask for a little more each day from our manufacturer .
we say to it today : 'do not disappoint u ' .
achieving a political agreement at copenhagen will still not be enough .
only then will it be possible to reduce distortion in international competitiveness .
we have an opportunity to take this historic step with the environment .
in actual fact , this study is an indictment of european agriculture .
i will bring up these issue when we discus future resolution .
on this aspect , good work ha been done in parliament .
there are just three point i want to make .
thirdly , funding ha been mentioned time and time again here this morning .
time is moving on and there will be no second chance .
nuclear power is definitely not the solution to the problem .
the benefit are minimal , the cost enormous and the risk very high .
we will need to agree on all of the content of the agreement .
an agreement will also be needed in order to avoid carbon leakage .
that is why the eu ha set the bar so high .
it would be cynical , then , not to take very forceful action .
and yet , i have heard even that today .
i should also like to comment on the world environmental organisation .
the deluge in neighbouring kilkenny is the worst in 60 year !
we must build up our resilience to the effect of climate change .
europe must also find effective and reasonable solution to the issue of funding .
we need to forget this idea of a new tax .
the eu should continue to lead by example in combating climate change .
we must also send a clear signal to emerging industry in asia .
the u ha a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit .
will these problem be resolved by restrictive limitation on co2 emission ?
community financial aid in the field of trans-european network ( codification ) (
list of third state and organisation for europol agreement (
amendment of annex ii and iii to the ospar convention (
request for defence of the immunity and privilege of tobias pflüger (
adaptation to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny - part five (
it is about granting eurojust and europol full access to the database .
i would like to ask all colleague not to vote in favour .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i am gratified that the council ha finally agreed to our proposal .
those are country ideally placed to price themselves into the market .
this is a phrase that also seems to apply sometimes in brussels .
prior court approval : that is what we wanted to obtain .
today 's vote is just one stage in a long process .
we have no choice but to disagree with such an attitude .
nevertheless , it doe give internet user legal mean of defending themselves .
this solution will certainly please the supporter of open access to the internet .
i voted in favour of this package because of it unquestionable usefulness .
these provision will therefore have a major economic impact .
unfortunately , the regulation will now contribute to this misinterpretation .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
the draft will also provide greater protection for confidential data .
these network are very important to the development of europe 's traffic infrastructure .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
this is unacceptable a far a we are concerned .
especially important attention should be paid to personal data protection .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
crime is continually on the increase in the european union .
in fact , it potential is far from having been achieved a yet .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
i do not believe that this is the right course .
this parliament must fully assume it new power in these matter .
i am voting against the adoption of the europol package .
these same reason are also behind our abstention on the remaining report .
financial imbalance are due to issue surrounding budget and the balance of payment .
in writing . - i abstained on the bullmann report .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the rosbach report .
international fishery organisation are essential to the management of global marine resource .
passenger must not be left behind in this , however .
rule on compensation for delay to international rail service are not enough .
that is why i voted in favour of this report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
i welcome the agreement reached on 19 november in yalta .
mr president , mr daul , thank you for your question .
however , a you said , the situation within ukraine is not easy .
how do you evaluate this standpoint from a member of the european council ?
my question is simple : how do you view this issue ?
we are reading and hearing rumour that are rather dangerous .
let u be clear , there is always pressure , a you know .
i have worked hard to obtain a fairly strong consensus .
a week ago , only three woman were prospective candidate .
unfortunately , it is not provided for by the treaty .
i agree with your fellow member , mr verhofstadt .
ideally , we would have a commission that is even more balanced .
we do , truly , think that europe need a common market .
we would like to pay tribute to that achievement .
that , of course , will always be the case .
many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next .
that notwithstanding , we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome .
the social consequence , especially , are giving u lot to deal with .
the number of crisis victim is going through the roof .
in the developing world , the consequence are much worse .
why did you wait until after the german election ?
but the ball now is clearly in gm 's court .
your oral dialogue is also at issue though , of course .
i am sure that we can come to an arrangement in this regard .
it wa a very clever move to convene the summit yesterday .
president of the commission . - the answer is simple : yes .
i think it is extremely important to have this idea at that level .
i would like to say something which is very serious .
that is very much 'follow-up to the european council ' .
in fact , it is becoming an extremely difficult matter .
so it is a very broad remit of competence .
regarding the delay , you are right : there is some delay .
i hope to have it by the end of january .
the timetable that you are giving u is extremely tight .
how can we define a strategy for now until 2020 in three month ?
we can not define a project for the european union in three month .
i am also hoping for a commitment from you on this point .
that is why i wa keen to present it now .
rather , they should be the subject of an amending budget .
we have to respect the rule of law in the european union .
so i believe they have the quality to fulfil their responsibility .
so we have to respect the different logic of the different institution .
we have to look at own resource of the european union .
this mean that price rise and development becomes impossible .
another aspect is combating illegal immigration and trafficking network .
how will the commission accomplish these task with parliament over the coming month ?
we achieved much more than last time , one month ago .
thank you very much , too , for keeping perfectly to your time .
we will see you again for question hour next month .
the programme is intended to supersede the current hague programme from 2004 .
from the citizen ' perspective , combating crime is important .
when it come to combating cross-border crime , the challenge are great .
it is completely possible and absolutely necessary to do both of these thing .
it is a matter of finding the right balance for the various measure .
one of the most important issue is the abolition of the exequatur procedure .
it take time and incurs cost for the individual .
the member state must also receive support for further capacity building .
frontex must be strengthened and be given a greater role in repatriation .
well-functioning practical cooperation is fundamental to u being able to achieve this .
i am thinking primarily of the resettlement of refugee from third country .
the commission ha recently presented a proposal for a joint eu resettlement programme .
there are a number of proposal for legislative act on the table .
we need , first and foremost , to make progress on these .
i now come to the priority highlighted in your draft resolution .
the commission will present a communication on this subject in 2010 .
the union must remain at the forefront on this issue .
we must provide legal immigrant with a clear and common status .
to conclude , the commission is fully involved in negotiating the stockholm programme .
when they leave that role , however , that understanding often crumbles away .
it wa a bad example of the institution taking each other seriously .
my second point is that we must be creator of idea .
the new treaty give u the opportunity to table legislative initiative .
in future , we will have the opportunity to do that .
finally , the european parliament must take subsidiarity seriously .
the union will be more open , more effective and more democratic .
i would like to share the following story with you .
she called the stewardess over to complain about her seating .
however , we do have one seat in first class . '
now , what ha this got to do with u ?
the white south african lady would shock u all .
i will turn now to the content of the stockholm programme .
part of this work programme are undoubtedly to be viewed a progress .
that also mean consciously standing up and advocating what you believe in .
this applies , for example , to our debate about the swift agreement .
we , parliament , very much need to do something about that .
we green can not vote 'yes ' to the resolution a it stand .
another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security .
europe seems not to want to move in the same direction .
officially , the aim here is to combat organised crime .
security is a citizen 's right , a is freedom .
it is high time parliament recognised this for once .
he now languishes in a greek prison awaiting trial .
witness statement have all the sign of having been written by the police .
in the process , it will destroy people 's life .
measure against illegal immigrant and against organised crime also have my support .
i also want to say something about the harmonisation of eu asylum law .
parliament 's resolution defines the european parliament 's political priority in this area .
there are also certain political difference within the internal dimension of this parliament .
there are different political group and there are differing political view .
the stockholm programme defines them today with an abundance of detail .
it should be constructed within the member state and the community institution .
it is a bottom-up process that the stockholm programme wish to support .
this is absolutely essential to accompany the european arrest warrant .
this is not the case at present and there are severe weakness .
it is shocking that this ha to go to strasbourg .
another matter is to stress the significance of the multilingual e-justice portal .
however , it is also an extremely complex issue .
i would like to emphasise the introduction of the convergence principle .
it is another step in the building of the eu state .
it is nothing other than the pooling of sovereignty .
i gladly note the children- and family-related paragraph in the paper .
let u finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institution !
that is what our fellow citizen expect from u .
but we must have a stockholm blueprint in the first place .
we will only do that when we vote through the stockholm programme .
we will then fight for a progressive stockholm programme and progressive legislation .
i welcome the equal weighting given to the three side of this triangle .
nevertheless , it is important to ensure that these target are met .
the legislation and instrument that have been adopted must be implemented effectively .
the text ha lost some of it teeth during the negotiation in coreper .
society are changed not by mediocrity but by courage , conviction and vision .
and that ha been displayed here in parliament this afternoon .
we are talking about freedom , security and justice : three fundamental principle .
interested party and organisation should have the broadest possible access to this information .
it is now time for the 'catch-the-eye ' period .
i am going to adhere absolutely strictly to the rule of procedure .
of course , the stockholm programme will be what we make it .
the eu also need a legal basis for combating violence against woman .
when we are not free , we are not secure .
we have now finished the speech under the 'catch-the-eye ' procedure .
mr president , thank you for all of your point of view .
we will , of course , give these careful consideration .
that is precisely the aim of the stockholm programme .
it is when we need cooperation that we must use the european institution .
he expressed concern about monitoring and large database , among other thing .
i think that this type of argument is completely irrelevant .
finally , someone said that we should make the stockholm programme more tangible .
i can say to you that it will get worse yet .
instead , all of the point contain a solidarity element .
the situation in the mediterranean is not primarily a border control problem .
it is a problem that requires several different type of measure .
we also need to invest in development cooperation in the form of aid .
i would add that the guideline against misuse have been published .
i would like to say that this text seems fairly balanced to me .
you gave the example of a british citizen in greece .
if there were minimum procedure , it would make thing much easier .
this , too , is the guarantee of a balanced european migration policy .
there is no denying that this is the case .
the programme will be implemented after the treaty of lisbon come into force .
this legal act must come into force a soon a possible .
this will be the task of spain 's forthcoming eu presidency .
the growth in discrimination and intolerance are increasingly serious social problem .
however , a ban doe not go far enough .
joint removal of irregular migrant to afghanistan and other third country ( debate )
the work relating to return also includes provision on joint removal flight .
this question ha been asked within each of our member state .
with this in mind , i would ask for clarification on three point .
this turn our idea of human right on it head .
commissioner , this is not the europe that we love .
europe is not there to legitimise national practice that violate fundamental right .
it is too easy to put the blame on europe .
i am very grateful for any explanation you can give u .
article 19 ( 1 ) : 'collective expulsion are prohibited ' .
you tell u that this is not a collective expulsion .
the european union take great pride in defending human right .
the right of asylum is one of those fundamental right .
mr president , i found part of the discussion a bit strange .
well , yes , that is precisely what this entire debate is about !
that is exactly what an individual review aim to clarify and ensure .
it is merely a question of logistics in this context .
mr president , my thanks to all of the speaker .
i shall read the following , from the french response .
we also received a response from the uk government .
all of the country need to starting doing this .
i am well aware that i have not responded to every single question .
2007 discharge : eu general budget - council ( debate )
it had , in fact , been going on for many year .
at the end of september , something finally happened .
the ball is now in the council 's court .
openness and transparency are the democratic tool we have available .
this will be the case in future , too .
mr president , mr malmström , mr barrot , a miracle ha occurred .
all 's well that end well , a we say in germany ?
i would like to thank the swedish presidency once again .
we do not like how the debate ha been going so far .
we are overcoming the council 's aversion to working with parliament .
i would like to personally congratulate the swedish presidency on this .
it ha always set out to act to promote transparency and accuracy .
yet we must admit that this remains a difficult exercise .
after all , the problem have not been solved .
however , i do have two area of concern which i must mention .
the committee intends to recommend discharge on expectation for the future .
the second wa that the council refused to provide any comprehensive written answer .
yet where are the precise answer to these question ?
i therefore ask the house to support the motion .
there is still a very long way to go .
this is the right step in the right direction .
mr president , thank you for debating this extremely important matter .
i am pleased that we agree on the importance of openness and transparency .
the question is not whether we have achieved everything we wanted to .
i agree that we have not achieved everything we wanted to .
we will be starting from the point we have reached this year .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 2009 .
the next item is question time ( b7-0223/2009 ) .
2009 is the european year of creativity and innovation .
this is being done in collaboration with the european investment fund .
the commission reacted very quickly to this threat in november 2008 .
the commission ha already begun preparation for the next growth and employment strategy .
we have good , and in some case outstanding , research capacity .
we also have very good result when it come to technological development .
we could certainly be better , though , when it come to innovation .
( ro ) thank you for the information and answer you have provided .
do you believe that the said programme can be extended ?
you ask why there can not be a standard bill for all consumer .
however , this is indirectly addressed by smart metering .
the second is financial market , and the third is local transport .
please take this back to the commission and think again .
the commission ha so far adopted four regulation authorising or rejecting health claim .
( ga ) i would like to thank the commissioner for her answer .
this is exactly the reason why we put forward this regulation .
i must say we were amazed by the number of application received .
we were expecting a few hundred and we received 44 000 claim .
an overview of these national institution and organisation is available on the website .
i could of course provide you with the website .
the commission promotes awareness of consumer right through various instrument .
i also have some news which is very important for u .
we have two new extension to the dolceta information website .
otherwise , it is very much divided from country to country .
i believe that this really is an important project for the future .
i think that one of these missing link is the retail market .
i shall , however , certainly pas on the message .
is this practice in compliance with the package travel directive ( 90/314/eec ) ?
however , the package travel directive doe not regulate this particular issue .
moreover , contract term should be drafted in plain and intelligible language .
there must be some directive which the company are breaching .
a very clear message should go out that this is extortionist .
i hired a car in frankfurt for my first day in parliament here .
the tank wa full and wa paid for by the company .
it is fair , it is transparent and it is proper .
subject : action programme for reducing administrative burden in the eu
i should like a reply from you to this particular but specific question .
i will mention a topical example in this regard .
this measure will save such business eur 7 billion a year in cost .
despite this , the commission still stand by it proposal .
we do have immense structural change to deal with , however .
we have enormous amount of competition to deal with , especially from asia .
the global economic crisis ha also had a negative effect on tourism .
the crucial thing is actually to also generate awareness of these tourism product .
i resisted making those same comment to other commissioner tonight .
i hope that you can confirm this again today .
a total of eur 14.8 million is envisaged for this .
i would then ask the plenary session to support this report .
we have questioned both commissioner špidla and commissioner kroes on this matter .
the first budgetary point you raise relates to funding source .
the work is performed on a case-by-case basis , according to need .
these are resource designated for supporting person , individual person and not company .
the factory in ireland focus on producing desktop computer .
i must , however , stress that we are only halfway there .
however , the various kind of state aid involved change thing .
we therefore advocate new policy on social development and progress .
however , we want some answer from the european commission about the future .
having said that , there are just two point i want to make .
what you gave u today , commissioner , wa an evasive answer .
you are hiding behind the polish government 's report .
the globalisation fund is part of competition policy and the structural fund .
that is what the globalisation fund allows u to do .
he said that we can not influence business decision .
this time it is difficulty resulting from structural change in world trade .
the fund is also intended to promote entrepreneurship and self-employment .
we simply feel that better use can be made of it .
this is precisely the problem that we are facing today .
the issue of individual budget item wa also raised .
nonetheless , the fund can operate in this way .
the second issue raised in the debate is a far more complex issue .
wage cost in poland are thus not lower but higher than in ireland .
the second issue is that of the dell case itself .
it therefore doe not involve resource from the european structural fund .
that is not in the interest of the originator .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 2009 .
the state of play of the euromed free trade area ( debate )
can the commission back up it response with sound reason ?
those are my question , mr president , commissioner .
in particular , progress ha been made in the north-south dimension .
bilateral negotiation will be tailored to the situation of each southern mediterranean partner .
the euromed free trade area also ha a south-south dimension .
it is too early for a full assessment of the current agadir agreement .
the euromed trade road map beyond 2010 should help solve this problem .
last month , we announced that the union is now ready to sign .
concluding this agreement with libya will be the final piece of the puzzle .
a sustainability impact assessment is currently being finalised for libya a well .
the bilateral approach must be accompanied by a regional approach .
i believe in it even le since the fact speak for themselves .
however , the negotiation still need to be steered in this direction .
it is unacceptable to go on thinking that way .
in this instance , i have to ask what is going on here .
if that is our aim , then we are on the right track .
strengthening intercultural dialogue will also play an important role in this context .
tonight we are discussing a free trade agreement in the euromed .
secondly , where is the net benefit to the european union country ?
i , too , have a question for the commissioner .
mr moreira put some very precise question to the commissioner .
i heard mr tajani answer : libya and syria .
i will attempt to answer your question , where possible .
this commitment is part of the european commission 's political project .
furthermore , the free trade agreement always contain cooperation clause .
i hope to have been a thorough a possible in answering your question .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 25 november 2009 .
safety and interoperability of the community railroad system ( debate )
we here in the european parliament have always taken rail safety very seriously .
these are all question that a a committee we seek answer to .
if this is so , then action is needed urgently .
all the new application take the compatible standard a their basis .
what is the situation with regard to the european train driver 's licence ?
how doe the commission intend to overcome this problem in the short term ?
if they are electric railroad , it is either dc or ac .
therefore , mr president , let u give the railroad a chance .
mr president , lady and gentleman , safety is a sacred thing .
( de ) mr president , it is not actually astonishing .
in my view , there are huge delay on this aspect .
lack of this investment will increase the number of rail accident .
railway accident have occurred in romania too during the last year .
i believe that this is an important element which should not be forgotten .
such a law can not , obviously , be implemented properly .
mr bauer , you were critical of the language law .
the second signal sent from this debate is also a crucial factor .
in the end , we are all member of minority .
finally , in parliament , itself we do not fulfil this multilingualism requirement .
ethnic minority representative were not involved in drafting the amendment .
another fundamental problem is that the state language law also includes sanction .
can a national minority be regarded a something of value ?
europe should be ashamed a long a this law exists .
this should not be a dispute between slovakia and hungary .
this implies that the minority are second-class citizen in their homeland .
it is not two country fighting against each other .
hungarian member here are attacking the slovak language law .
citizen can write to parliament and receive a response in these language .
it would only help to generate pointless frustration for many loyal citizen .
thirdly , it is anti-democratic because it instils fear among citizen .
the positive attitude to the language ha had huge cultural benefit .
in wale , the key ha been to take a pragmatic approach .
he spoke these word on the occasion of world peace day .
i believe this is also the view of the commission .
this is a result of provocation and nationalist pressure .
i do not want to repeat those point which have been made .
we can not say either that this doe not feature in the law .
the problem lie exactly in the law 's presentation .
i therefore think that there are very serious problem with this .
( sk ) i must protest against the previous speaker .
we need to have dialogue and we can not achieve this without language .
i have had the opportunity to visit all the member state .
however , we also fund project linked to particular minority and regional language .
the same applies to basque and numerous other language .
this is why it is particularly important to preserve minority ' culture .
in romania , minority can address court in their mother tongue .
they have school where instruction is given in their mother tongue .
all 19 of romania 's minority are represented in parliament .
the new treaty will change the way the eu work in several respect .
the european external action service will be included among these issue .
the economic prospect look brighter , but there are still major risk .
we will also monitor the eu 's economic recovery plan .
the financial sector 's need for support measure ha diminished .
the integrated maritime policy will also be discussed at the european council meeting .
the swedish presidency will put all of it energy into this work .
these issue will have top priority at the final summit .
it is a decision i welcome and personally support very much .
herman van rompuy ha earned huge respect a prime minister of belgium .
i will now move on to the portfolio allocation .
the european union ha shown itself the pioneer of action on climate change .
we have been the first to show that cap and trade can work .
what should the key message from the european council be ?
we can not negotiate against the science of nature .
in particular , fast start funding is going to be very important .
we have come a long way over the last 10 year .
now the lisbon treaty give u a new opportunity to move ahead .
european union action ha made a major contribution over the last year .
now we must keep the strength of purpose and sense of focus .
let u make the most out of what lie ahead .
let u work together for the common european good .
the commission and i myself are ready to take up the challenge .
mr president , lady and gentleman , here we are at last .
we know that two major topic will dominate the european council in december .
in this respect , we are expecting concrete undertaking from the european council .
it is important for u to discus people and position .
we have achieved what we have been fighting for .
in my opinion , we are not talking enough about climate change .
can europe 's energy security problem be solved peacefully ?
this is a job for the high representative of the european union .
therefore , i would like finally to repeat my remark to mr barroso .
we social democrat have discussed our idea with you .
i think that nearly one third of liberal commissioner is a good figure .
everyone is saying that the belgian are very proud of him .
we are drawing too few logical conclusion from our discussion .
another agenda item for the next summit is the lisbon strategy .
why did we get into such a disastrous economic crisis ?
finally , i would like to look at the stockholm programme .
it wa a serious mistake not to put swift on the agenda .
our citizen do understand europe 's self-absorption only too well .
it is go , go , go all the time .
i think that is an honourable position for u to take .
above all , we welcome the fact that a woman ha been elected .
four million job were lost throughout europe a a result of the crisis .
i have just three observation to make about this .
we are interested to see how you will achieve this .
i thought this wa going to be a big , proud moment !
no wonder , sir , you look so happy this morning .
and we have a new president of europe , herman van rompuy .
it doe not exactly trip off the tongue , doe it ?
in some way she is ideal , is she not ?
so i guess she is perfect for this european union .
i mean , no one ha ever heard of her .
she is even le well-known than herman van rompuy !
i mean , that take some doing , doe it not ?
well , at least i have been elected , sir , unlike her !
cathy ashton wa an active member of the campaign for nuclear disarmament .
if we really think that , frankly , we need our bump felt !
she ha no experience and she must answer those question .
did she take money from enemy of the west ?
i would like to say a word to mr farage .
cooperation between the different supervisory body ha not been working either .
they will have an overarching view and enhanced cooperation .
it also ha to do with the stockholm programme .
it ha allowed member state ' authority to prevent terrorist attack in europe .
i can give you some data on that , if you wish .
the information wa passed to the government of european and middle eastern nation .
so , this system ha already saved many life in europe and elsewhere .
after all , parliament will be strengthened pursuant to the treaty of lisbon .
the latter will therefore be involved in the development of the lisbon agenda .
this mean we will have to work much harder .
life is not going to be easier for u .
on the contrary , it is going to become more complicated .
the european parliament will also have to be more involved regarding data protection .
i think that this is a very good idea .
it is right that you should work together with the council .
one final word on the debating culture in this house .
but many of u feel that we have missed a critical opportunity .
this is where any international agreement made will be delivered .
i very much doubt it , but it should be .
evidently , some had been hoping for some kind of european superman .
that equates to two turkish soldier outside every turkish cypriot house .
i do not know of any meps with that much security .
the european union now ha a permanent president and a foreign high representative .
do these personnel decision convey an important message to u ?
the treaty of lisbon doe not specify the duty of the permanent president .
however , this involves a decisive step against the united state .
what is important is how the treaty will be applied .
cooperation between the european commission and the european parliament is hugely important here .
i prefer to recall with you the right and duty of we meps .
this is good news for the commission and good news for our parliament .
having said that , i shall now take up a number of point .
everything will be fine when we agree on the major task facing europe .
however , only a democratic europe can be successful in the long term .
finally , i would like to say one thing .
i think that this will be a task for the future .
i hope that parliament will take an active role in this strategy .
europe 's citizen must be at the heart of this strategy .
thank you and i wish you every success at the meeting .
adverse weather is causing other unforeseen human tragedy across our planet .
we need to act , but fighting this alone will not work .
the 'what ' must be the focus on our citizen .
what ha not been done to save the treaty of lisbon ?
it is rare to come across someone embodying so many quality .
i am not the only one to deplore this state of affair .
these are the challenge that our electorate want u to tackle .
however , it is not just god 's gift .
first and foremost , the way is now open for common european policy .
there are no longer any formal excuse to abstain from them .
this year ha been a very successful one for the fyrom .
secondly , implementation of the treaty of lisbon is beginning .
i think another reshuffle could certainly fulfil this requirement in the future .
this , too , is a matter for the forthcoming council .
in addition , there is everything connected with the economic crisis .
in this respect , we have heard much talk of a powerful europe .
this question is very closely linked to the stockholm programme .
in particular , we need to protect those who can not protect themselves .
before we can protect human freedom , we must protect human life .
if it were true , it would be quite absurd .
it is transport and infrastructure for energy that are at issue .
these are very important attribute in the time we live in .
a presidential-style guru strutting the world stage , causing trouble ?
the european union is the greatest peace process ever known .
firstly , we need to be cautious about the end of the crisis .
it is also time to plot the route ahead .
one concern the sale of carbon dioxide quota after 2012 .
we are moving over to policy making in a new context .
how will we handle the financial and economic crisis ?
the summit must pas the responsibility for this financial review to the commission .
however , people realised that the process did not involve democratic choice .
the latter absolutely must include bold target and innovative measure .
we need to establish a road map for it introduction .
secondly , we need to adopt a plan for economic renewal .
a certain kind of balance between these important value is essential here .
this priority on the swedish presidency 's agenda ha been successfully achieved .
mr president , i will answer a few short question .
i will say a brief word about the baltic sea strategy .
i believe that president barroso also mentioned this yesterday during question time .
thank you very much for a very good and constructive debate .
we have already had good comment in the debate here .
i would just like to comment on one thing concerning the stockholm programme .
this is good news for european citizen and also for all eu institution .
so , again , thank you very much for the debate .
these principle must also be fully implemented at the level of european-wide legislation .
that wa the reality of mr farage 's speech .
i think this agreement is ambitious a well a realistic .
adaptation of the european parliament 's rule of procedure to the lisbon treaty (
it is seen a such by all our colleague .
would the rapporteur like to say something about this ?
preparation of the copenhagen summit on climate change ( vote )
would a representative of the committee like to say something about this ?
are you proposing a change to the voting order ?
i have to say we were not expecting this change .
we can follow the procedure that she ha proposed .
therefore , i hope that the interpreter now translate the polish number correctly .
instead , we will have an official presence in the eu pavilion .
perhaps mr reding would like to say something on this subject .
the state of play of the euromed free trade area ( vote )
passenger compensation in the event of airline bankruptcy ( vote )
9 . 'made in ' ( origin marking ) ( vote )
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
that being said , the role of this adjustment fund must be assessed .
the fund is not reflecting the reason for which it wa set up .
all aspect of the globalisation adjustment fund therefore need to be carefully assessed .
it end in stagnation , inflation and ultimately in collective bankruptcy .
but have we not always had major change in world trade pattern ?
the first is that we need to reach a legally binding agreement .
we need to have ambitious target in this regard .
i believe that we could have gone further than we did today .
climate change is a global political priority at the copenhagen summit .
however , the rich country have to play the leading role .
thank you for having taken notice of what i have said .
a a conservative , i consider myself a natural conservationist .
the next task is to set up a european judicial area .
i believe that these are goal requiring a greater commitment by all ...
this is particularly important with regard to the asylum procedure .
no home secretary in any member state could say that today .
i accept it ha not been done in secret .
( fr ) mr president , i had asked to talk about stockholm .
million of our citizen use low-cost airline every day .
this would allow the repatriation of passenger left stranded in foreign airport .
this ha driven many other airline into an unhealthily competitive situation .
instead , it embodies the fundamental economic principle of levelling the playing field .
we are therefore discussing matter that concern europe a a whole .
i voted for this regulation regarding the fuel efficiency labelling of tyre .
the aim is to promote the use of safe , quieter tyre .
moreover , labelling will lead to increased competition among manufacturer .
this labelling is beneficial from an environmental point of view .
the provision of this regulation will be enforced from 1 november 2012 .
the transport sector is responsible for approximately 25 % of polluting emission .
this is why this regulation will help reduce these emission .
this state aid wa approved by the european commission .
it would therefore be better if application were submitted separately in future .
this is a crucial fund for strengthening economic and social cohesion .
at any rate , this is not our vision of europe .
future cooperation with national parliament is also important here .
for those reason , i voted in favour of this report .
the european parliament is a component of the reactionary construct of the eu .
the world is staking it future on the month to come .
it is crucial that the copenhagen conference result in a politically binding agreement .
only then will it be possible to reduce distortion in international competition .
ireland 's per caput carbon emission is 17.5 tonne per annum .
clearly , this mean radical change in the production and consumption of energy .
the response to climate change lie in strong international governance and financial commitment .
indeed , climate change will require increased investment in the public sector .
we must aim for an actual 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas emission .
failure in copenhagen would be an environmental , political and moral disaster !
i believe that the copenhagen agreement should be binding .
the u ha a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit .
the european union produce approximately 11 % of worldwide co2 emission .
the greek communist party voted against the european parliament resolution .
i can not justify to my voter using their money in this way .
sadly , respect for child 's right ha not yet been universally ensured .
it is also a resolution which guarantee the protection of refugee and migrant .
this resolution is a step towards progressive european lawmaking on migration .
the next stage : the european council on 9 and 10 december 2009 !
the current situation confirms that these prediction were right .
however , just making a law is not enough .
it is also a resolution which guarantee the protection of refugee and migrant .
this resolution is a step towards progressive european lawmaking on migration .
the eu must intensify effort related to fighting transborder crime and terrorism .
in addition , the treaty of lisbon give u security .
we have found a good balance between security and citizen ' right .
i think we have chosen a good middle way .
unfortunately , plenary did not support my call for police access to eurodac .
the mediterranean is the cradle of civilisation a we know it .
i refer to the establishment of a free trade area across both region .
i am against implementing such a free trade area .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 )
seventy-seven airline have filed for bankruptcy in the european union since 2000 .
the commission must urgently take a legislative initiative to address this worrying situation .
over the last nine year , 77 european airline company have gone bankrupt .
this is why i believe that this directive is absolutely necessary .
that is a shame and that is why i will abstain .
no additional cost must be involved for small and medium-sized business .
i very much welcome the introduction of origin marking by the european union .
the market is free only when rule are clear , mutual and applied .
( the sitting wa suspended at 14.10 and resumed at 15.00 )
the rapporteur for parliament on this matter wa mr del castillo vera .
the effort of many people combined to produce this success .
the package strengthens competition and the protection of consumer in europe .
the telecom package is a major victory for all consumer in europe .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
two world war ; two totalitarian ideology ; strife and suffering .
we all know that the process ha not been entirely easy .
their door to our union might sometimes be a very distant one .
that is why article 49 remains of such fundamental importance .
that is a major and most important step forward .
the accession process of croatia ha been unblocked and is now moving forward .
this is important for croatia and for the entire region .
there are numerous other issue which i think the commissioner will go into .
this will start a new era in the eu 's foreign policy .
this will enable u to continue our gradual and carefully managed accession process .
bosnia and herzegovina and serbia are both considering submitting an application .
given the economic crisis , all these country might easily have turned inwards .
croatia is nearing the finishing line after four year of intense accession negotiation .
we have seen steady progress in turkey a well .
these factor enabled the commission to recommend the opening of accession negotiation .
i agree with your draft resolution to unblock the agreement .
respect for human right is a founding principle of the european union .
a for kosovo , stability ha been maintained but still remains fragile .
it will obviously benefit from the contribution of specific resolution on each country .
that is a great pity , in my opinion .
one last thing : other ethnic minority and sexual minority .
i find this is an important path towards democratisation .
i also welcome the fact that iceland may be a candidate soon .
i should like to mention the case of turkey .
i should also like to mention the case of kosovo .
van rompuy ha thus expressed objection to turkish membership in principle .
and we , the dutch party for freedom , completely agree with him .
we should not be denied the possibility of criticising islam .
cease all negotiation with turkey and other islamic country .
however , it is also important to explain that the copenhagen criterion apply .
we should not impose conditionality which are not linked with these criterion .
thirdly , each country should indeed come in based on it merit .
here , i would single out turkey , in particular .
let u also not shut the door on our eastern partner .
we should offer ukraine a clear possibility of membership .
the word 'solidarity ' is very often used in the european union .
this is a contradiction of the principle of solidarity .
enlargement make sense , but we must have conformity between rhetoric and practice .
we all need to be brave enough to face the reality .
turkey is increasingly pursuing an anti-european and an anti-western foreign policy .
very recently , 45 % of turk supported this objective .
this is a question which we have not definitively answered .
these figure speak for themselves and no politician can or should deny them .
we must ask ourselves whether further enlargement process are appropriate for u .
why did we have to pay compliment to turkey ?
the majority of the eu population is clearly against turkey joining the eu .
it would be possible to resolve numerous non-european conflict following turkey 's accession .
madam president , the country proposed for eu membership are comparatively poor .
you think you are enlarging the eu empire by this ill thought-out policy .
in fact , you are driving it towards economic chaos in the future .
thirdly , we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizen .
another relevant idea contained in the resolution is the capacity for integration .
enlargement requires existing member of the union to take certain measure .
we must nevertheless feel more involved in the process of enlargement .
however , i would like to ask my fellow member to react calmly .
( de ) madam president , thank you very much for the question .
this doe not seem to me to be an ideal neighbourhood .
the president of the italian republic ha said that pact must be respected .
i agree , but we must consider that turk are turk .
in other word , full adaptation is required for full integration .
within this framework , the application of good neighbourly relation is very important .
we must not try and hide behind our finger .
i appreciate his good humour and i appreciate his good judgement .
i would also like u to view it a an historical process .
finally , allow me to say a word about turkey .
however , it is bosnia and herzegovina which cause me much more concern .
how can we make contact with broad swathe of the population ?
you do not want to understand that and you will never understand that .
everyone must do their bit , including those in the european union .
the aim of accession progress is the accession itself .
however , we have adequate instrument for monitoring compliance with accession condition .
the process , it should be stressed , is voluntary .
you are not part of one of the major group .
we had public opinion against the european union for quite some time .
it did apply to sweden once upon a time , and we managed .
so that is what we have to abide by .
could i just finally pick up one of my favourite item .
i do not see our union a 'absorbing ' nation .
i do not know if we have absorbed britain .
and i do not know if france want to be absorbed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 november 2009 .
in writing . - i would like to make three observation .
this is very much due to the excellent work of commissioner rehn .
we should also remain clear about the relevance of the copenhagen criterion .
turkey regard itself a the supreme power of the turkic people .
it is high time that we began speaking honestly and clearly .
the serbian parliament ha adopted a law on national council .
our resolution on future enlargement must reflect the prevailing opinion in europe .
we must avoid repeating past mistake and build europe with it people .
now i feel that we actually need to see some concrete action .
this is a type of violence that robs woman of their human right .
at the same time , it help to maintain this power order .
however , it is , above all , an equality problem .
that is something that parliament ha repeatedly called for since 1997 .
however , measure are also taken at european level .
many of the most vulnerable woman in the world live in developing country .
however , we should not be content with this .
the broader campaign to promote the empowerment of woman help to combat violence .
employment is often the best way to leave poverty behind .
the problem of violence against woman know no national boundary .
i am grateful to parliament for raising this issue today .
these fund were in addition to the aid provided by the national programme .
the result of this study will be presented in autumn 2010 .
madam president , i would like to finish on a personal note .
it is therefore a topic that must be tackled on different front .
it is essential that we in the eu take action now .
i hope this will be priority for all of u .
violence affect the victim , their family and child .
it effect are both insular and outgoing and destroy life .
the road to rebuilding these life is long and need support .
project like this need support , and need financial support .
let me stress again : this is totally unacceptable .
unfortunately , the statistic still indicate that 95 % of victim are woman .
there can be no reason , no argument and no scope for understanding .
some woman are murdered simply because they are woman .
country such a spain have made a clear commitment in this regard .
the law against gender violence is a necessary and essential instrument .
it should therefore serve a an example to the rest of europe .
we must make a joint effort and work together .
more woman die from the aggression directed against them than die from cancer .
this is an essential condition for real equality and ending violence .
violence against woman is unacceptable , irrespective of the form it take .
a we debate these extremely serious matter , woman are being assaulted .
the european union ha a duty to protect it most vulnerable citizen .
new measure must be considered for the development of consistent european plan .
to punish her , her husband poured acid over her .
he did it one night ; he did it while she wa sleeping .
it is only right that men also become involved in this struggle .
that is why i am taking part in the white ribbon campaign .
this is why we should increase our effort to combat this problem .
it is a problem for everyone in the world .
i would like to express my thanks for this extremely important debate .
unfortunately , i do not think there is a legal basis for that .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday , 26 november 2009 .
domestic violence aim to control and destroy the human spirit .
similarly , statistic in other member state are misleading .
this is because woman often fear being misunderstood by authority and judicial body .
the motion rightly focus on the prosecution of perpetrator .
no social problem can be solved completely in just six month .
however , we must nonetheless admit that violence is also a problem .
this mean that existing mechanism will have to be evolved and widened .
coordination is , of course , the key to success .
there are currently 75 suspect being held in kenyan jail .
on the security side , a rapid approach is essential .
the new contribution agreement of eur 60 million ha just been finalised .
but , we all know that much more ha yet to be done .
let me now turn to another important issue before concluding .
in the meantime , the pirate are continuing to carry out attack .
we should be working on the principle of caution rather than haste .
that is indeed the nature of the problem and it very root .
commissioner , what you said wa a pleasant surprise to me .
the community 's institution are duty bound to do so .
let u therefore continue to support the work of this mission .
what value can we add to the current u and french training project ?
we do not understand how this mission can contribute to state-building .
why do we believe that the soldier will help it ?
that operation is clearly inadequate , however , and must be strengthened .
they are profitable and member state must respond to the situation .
regrettably , mr de grandes pascual , this is what ha been happening .
we condemn any act of piracy , without a doubt .
combating this phenomenon , however , requires more than soldier and mercenary .
over time , we need to try and deal with it all .
that is not the reason for not doing what we can do .
that is what we are trying to do with different training programme .
that in itself is something to be proud of .
somebody asked whether there could be a summit on piracy in the future .
if they have an interest , then they might indeed do so .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday , 26 november 2009 ) .
at these time , they are therefore at risk of pirate attack .
therefore , acting on a long-term basis , we must concentrate on :
• resolute maintenance and execution of the arm embargo on somalia ,
• striving for lasting peace agreement between the party , and ,
• support in building state institution active throughout the country .
this attitude show an unacceptable disregard for those elected by europe 's citizen .
there is no safe level of exposure to passive tobacco smoke .
article 8 concern protection against exposure to tobacco smoke .
this reality should guide u when drafting and supporting anti-smoking legislation .
passive smoking is a huge problem , particularly for child .
we have a lot to learn from other european country in this respect .
however , it is this sort of protection that is urgently needed .
we need this change and we should support it .
there could be some discussion about whether this might discriminate against smoker .
of course , there is still more to achieve .
they will not regret it , i can guarantee that .
but i do not think the decision should be taken at european level .
i am a federalist but i am not a centralist .
we in brussels have come up against our limit in this respect .
for me , protecting child and young people is particularly important .
madam president , my thanks to the honourable member for this important debate .
i believe that we have many point of view in common .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday , 26 november 2009 ) .
no one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection .
the motion call for strict and legally binding regulation at eu level .
in writing . - ( de ) i am a non-smoker myself .
the draft council recommendation on smoke-free environment is not a sensible measure .
however , the european union ha no direct authority in this area .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00 )
the ratification and implementation of the updated ilo convention ( debate )
our value are those on which the ilo wa founded .
it now seems that you must take much more ambitious action .
so , tonight , we in parliament are reinforcing all of those call .
firstly , the eu should take the lead in fighting for decent work .
we therefore supported the initial draft of the joint resolution tabled here .
fundamental worker ' right must be ensured and respected throughout the eu .
the right to strike is also a fundamental right .
we do not need more talk ; what we need is action .
they do not ratify them and they do not implement them .
this allows the member state and the eu to shirk their responsibility .
we must not forget this , particularly at this time of crisis .
we hope that this will happen a soon a possible .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 november 2009 .
once more , world food security ha been in the spotlight .
however , we need more and sustained assistance over time .
hunger ha not been halved , it ha increased .
more than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day .
the opposite of what these organisation intended ha occurred .
there is a wide range of different cause for this .
that is something we have to take very , very seriously .
poverty and dependence on import are the main cause of food insecurity .
to do this it protected it internal market and supported it consumer .
take zimbabwe , for example , which mr deß ha already referred to .
here and elsewhere we continue to make our fine speech .
it is not because there are technical problem that child are dying .
it is the result of this wave of ultra-liberalism flooding the world today .
until now , we worked the land to feed people .
we must hear the cry of famine and act accordingly .
that would make europe grow in stature , and it is urgent !
yet , there is no mention of this in the final declaration .
that is my personal duty and our collective responsibility .
( bg ) i personally attended the fao meeting in rome .
i saw with my own eye what this conference wa like .
i would advise caution about what is said in this chamber .
the commissioner spoke today about the first , most important goal .
agriculture is going to be very important in the next few year .
this seems to be too sensitive for world leader to discus .
then there is the common agricultural policy of the eu .
that cause food shortage and brings a need for food import .
when can we see a free and fair european agricultural policy ?
so there are three point which we need to understand .
farmer in northern ireland want to help to meet that need .
cap reform will determine the farmer ' ability to produce food .
this will only be achieved by allowing farmer to farm .
i think we should all be very pleased with that .
we are not progressing : we are actually moving backwards .
otherwise , we will not manage to meet the millennium development goal .
hunger is present in the european union a well .
we have reached the most serious level of global famine since 1970 .
and we have got to save the life of child .
of course , money is also needed to combat world hunger .
we also need to meet the following requirement beforehand .
too little is often said about the first three point .
it seems to me that subsistence agriculture is undoubtedly the most obvious answer .
this mean that adequate long-term funding for the cap is required .
first , the link between hunger and climate change .
the cap is not perfect , but it ha been reformed .
i think the crisis should teach u a lesson .
so that in itself is a very positive element .
so we should not blame ourselves all the time .
by the way , this facility wa an innovation by my predecessor .
the vote will take place on thursday , 26 november 2009 .
the next item is the commission statement on meat import from third country .
we can only require that their measure have an equivalent effect to ours .
these measure can be grouped into five main level of protection .
fifth , we have specific condition concerning meat production and storage .
all imported meat must undergo mandatory veterinary check at eu border .
all the measure i have described are fully harmonised .
a a consequence , eu import of brazilian beef have dropped dramatically .
this process will continue unless adequate measure are taken .
let u , however , examine the issue more closely .
there is huge evidence from the fvo in relation to this .
we can not stand idly by and let this practice continue .
i want to look in particular at the fvo report from brazil .
i hope that indicates that we are interested and serious regarding this issue .
you are not going to destroy u any more .
around 100 farm per month are given that right .
there are grave concern about unidentified cattle in slaughterhouse .
which agricultural industry doe the eu and the commission actually support ?
he said that unregulated meat wa imported into the eu .
you said that , mr bufton , quite early in your presentation .
the whole issue is there : it is quite clear .
we are on the same side with this one .
madam president , i thank the commissioner for her lengthy and full statement .
sometimes late at night we get cross , but sometimes it is justified .
but my issue is the recent fvo report on beef import from brazil .
the eu commission and the fvo have a responsibility to ensure both .
i certainly would not give them an 'a ' grade for their work .
firstly , commissioner , you talked about poster in airport .
secondly , i am not convinced about your argument regarding brazilian beef .
you have to have a sound eu food policy .
the two point i have made show it to be falling very short .
this is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy .
i am not interested in shaming brazil or other country .
a already discussed , i am not interested in partitioning off europe .
we will not give up until equal competitive condition have been established .
a you are well aware , europe is a net importer of meat .
yet we wish to guarantee consumption condition and the health of our consumer .
i agree with you that we have indeed taken some step forward .
we will be calling for this now and in future from the commission .
madam president , the debate prior to this wa about hunger .
it is produced a cheaply a country can produce it .
europe ha chosen a food model to protect it population .
that is also what we have asked brazil to do .
these problem were recognised to be minor problem by the fvo team .
we have heard a lot about romania and bulgaria .
if they do not , then they will not .
despite this , their significantly lower price make them competitive in the marketplace .
we should draw conclusion from the critical situation in the dairy market .
presentation of the court of auditor ' annual report - 2008 ( debate )
we have four key message in this year 's annual report .
the picture for payment , however , continues to be mixed .
we have had a very fruitful dialogue and the report is very constructive .
this can certainly be attributed to the substantial simplification effort of recent year .
this reduces the risk of error and the cost of control .
however , 31 % of the budget is still coloured in red .
we will definitely be focusing on this in the year to come .
we must deal with the problem in this area at source .
secondly , it wa declared that the year 2008 would definitely be better .
we must strive to achieve the best result regarding these grey area .
there may be fraud , there may be deception .
we must endeavour to make improvement in this area .
there are certainly a great many positive thing to say today .
we had seen member state such a greece failing to take part .
these are obviously all thing that are moving in the right direction .
all the same , there are source of concern .
a third issue to be addressed is the whole system of comanagement .
i myself am responsible for own resource on the committee on budgetary control .
the whole vat dossier continues to cause me concern .
according to estimate , total vat fraud europe-wide amount to eur 80-100 billion .
we are surely justified in wanting to hear detail of these impropriety .
for the remaining 48 % , they give a qualified opinion .
but , to be honest , nobody care about this .
it is just taxpayer ' money we are dealing with .
this represents eur 4 billion that ha been swept under the carpet .
i should like to hear what the commission intends to do about this .
how will it make sure that those eur 4 billion are returned ?
i would like to congratulate mr kallas warmly in this respect .
we must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear control .
we must implement a policy of naming and shaming .
overall , you come to the conclusion that the regulation must be simplified .
to me , the commission 's silence seems highly eloquent .
the committee responsible ha had discussion along the same line .
this is not a reasonable way of dealing with taxpayer ' money .
what is the commissioner 's own opinion of this ?
the commission like to present itself a the 28th donor .
could information on the effectiveness of policy be included in future ?
what condition doe the commission actually impose , however ?
the european court of auditor rightly underline the importance of simplifying the rule .
regarding the content , aside from cohesion spending , the observation are positive .
with regard to cohesion spending , there are too many error .
this amount to eur 2.7 billion and not eur 5 billion .
these irregularity relate mainly to excessive payment and the incorrect use of fund .
on this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the european commission .
i should like to highlight three aspect of this annual report .
the same is true in other country a well .
we must take note of this auditor ' opinion .
we can not pretend it is the auditor ' fault .
however , even a clean audit opinion in itself is not enough .
( de ) we need a revolution in democracy !
however , now you have the opportunity to look to the future .
we owe this to every tax-paying european citizen , regardless of their nationality .
we have to further reduce the complexity at european level .
thank you for the last five year of cooperation .
eur 2.7 billion is , of course , a very large amount .
it is an unreasonably large amount and it is totally unacceptable .
yet you will be confronted with the bill , commissioner .
we will be discussing this with the council in the next few week .
the eu account allow a 2 % margin of error .
we can not allow any uncertainty when it come to these .
the situation wa also the same in the two previous year .
we now pay out fund based on simple technical requirement .
however , i am quite optimistic about the future .
therefore , we do have to name the country concerned .
the commissioner , too , ha been too optimistic .
quite simply , i do not think this is good enough .
i call on the commission to take it share of the responsibility .
you have the tool . you need to react more rapidly .
the court of auditor strongly emphasis the need for greater simplification .
they have given substance to the european union 's fundamental value .
we must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming year .
( de ) i am reminded of two basic rule from my childhood .
it is important to name name in this respect .
the situation regarding the error rate in rural development is rather different .
this doe not necessarily mean that money is being wasted .
the first is the institution ' policy on building and property .
i wanted to express this regret , madam president .
( nl ) i have been present throughout the debate .
various explanation have been given for this in the debate .
( hu ) madam president , i completely agree with mr audy .
however , the council is the most conspicuous by it absence .
several meps have asked what can be done to solve these problem .
did the few error or irregularity identified prevent project from being completed ?
we consider our sample to be appropriate for drawing our conclusion .
mr audy asked the following question : are your sample of sufficient size ?
firstly , one important thing wa underlined : transparency .
i want to remind you that together we have made a big breakthrough .
it is a long process and we must take it very seriously .
national declaration and the participation of member state need a stronger legal basis .
you can not have a dialogue when the fact are not correct .
in future , we should put all our effort into two area .
the first of these is cooperation between the commission and the member state .
google 's project to digitise the world 's book heritage ( debate )
we must look closely at these question over the next few month .
we must deal with these question a quickly a possible .
doe copyright need to be adapted in the digital age ?
author and publisher want to receive a financial reward for their work .
how can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age ?
should we perhaps distinguish between literary work and scientific or academic work ?
look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet .
i am interested to know what the commission is planning .
this issue is definitely intensive , interesting , exciting and very future-oriented .
i will first of all give an overview concerning this concrete question .
first , the revised settlement ha been significantly narrowed in scope .
all other book are outside the scope of the settlement .
the new version of the settlement give rise to two remark .
first , being outside the settlement is not always an advantage .
it will make literature and learning more accessible to the digital generation .
it will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and culture .
unfortunately , i have to say that most of the saint are gone .
this is a central question and a major necessity .
we need to find an effective and practical solution to this problem .
it is an opportunity for author to expand their market and their audience .
it is something we should welcome and positively encourage .
europe should not allow itself to be controlled by google .
however , the real question is this : what alternative exist in europe ?
how much are we prepared to put on the table ?
for we must not , of course , squander this opportunity in europe .
we should support effort to make book searchable , readable and downloadable .
public access to such resource is of paramount importance .
we must cherish public access to our shared european culture and heritage .
however , we have similar institutionalised instrument in the european union .
we must guarantee freedom to reader , writer and retailer alike .
we must also guarantee cultural diversity and equality for minority language .
we must do our utmost to eliminate digital illiteracy .
on a smaller scale , this is what we call piracy .
like many of those present here , i find google an interesting company .
i think that their idea is an innovative and good one .
they have a quota of 15 % for book that can be censured .
europe can not afford to miss the boat on this matter .
no , such a decision will influence european culture .
secondly , publication of out-of-print work requires special supervision .
in my opinion , the question of out-of-print work should be harmonised .
columcille discovered it and got up each night to copy it .
finian wa not pleased and he asked for it back .
he did not get it back so he appealed to the high king .
we agree that the book need to go online and fast .
they will go anyway , whether we want it or not .
the framework directive will appear somewhere between autumn 2010 and spring 2011 .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.50 and resumed at 12.00 )
we have prepared a report which raise the profile of the voluntary sector .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
the ratification and implementation of the updated ilo convention ( vote )
i do not see any sign of this progress .
with respect to all this , i am mainly talking about turkey .
however , i did not want to vote against the other accession candidate .
mr senyszyn accused the catholic church of oppressing woman .
it would be difficult to say something more absurd .
thus , it is a phenomenon which directly affect u .
men and woman should have the same chance of physical integrity .
the eu can not continue to ignore these fact .
this lead to the existence of invisible crime statistic .
europe ha no army , nor doe it have any business being there .
this is one hundred per cent a job for nato .
the european union ha no authority in this area .
we are only responsible for health and safety at work .
therefore , the member state must take action in this area .
however , unfortunately , french tobacco production ha disappeared .
i prefer to see it grown here rather than imported from elsewhere .
( pl ) mr president , thank you for allowing me to speak .
this is because tobacco production is not related to it consumption .
fighting the tobacco producer is not the way to reduce smoking .
the representative of the developed world did not adopt any concrete obligation .
the european year of volunteering is hence an important initiative .
the most basic definition of volunteering is goodwill in action .
indeed , the largest voluntary association in ireland is the gaelic athletic association .
they make an immeasurable impact in their community and on people 's life .
i endorsed the report on the european year of volunteering ( 2011 ) .
in addition , volunteering is significant for integration , social policy and education .
volunteering also ha economic value , and we must not forget this .
for this reason i voted in favour of the report .
the eu is a rock of stability on this continent .
in writing . - i voted for amendment 4 .
i strongly oppose the commission 's enlargement strategy with regard to turkey .
instead it represents the geostrategic interest of the u .
turkey , in particular , ha taken a major step backwards .
the situation of this issue in portugal is worrying .
the eu need to step up it effort to combat this issue .
in writing . - i welcome parliament 's commitment to this cause .
for these reason , the ecr group ha chosen to abstain .
however much we paper over the crack , the problem will persist .
one part of the solution requires international support in bringing stability to somalia .
other state will contribute to the operation in the future .
operation atalanta ha succeeded in providing protection for high-risk cargo by escorting them .
thirty-six pirate vessel have been intercepted and 14 direct attack have been avoided .
incidentally , we do not recognise such terminology a 'eu fishing vessel . '
they must not be left in any doubt about this .
having said this , i would still like to express two concern .
firstly , are we heading towards a society that imposes blanket ban ?
this is my opinion on item 9 of this resolution .
i consider the remaining point positive , so i have voted in favour .
i abstained in the vote on the resolution on smoking .
i distance myself from this constant , counterproductive harassment .
smoking is the greatest single cause of premature death in europe .
it is necessary , in particular , to protect child .
many member state have already implemented some excellent measure .
now , two year later , people are only grateful .
it need to be recognised that the recommendation have not been sufficient everywhere .
the union first need to take the mote out of it own eye .
one of those is also the region which i come from , blagoevgrad .
this is a proactive and ambitious resolution we are dealing with .
more than a billion people are currently suffering from starvation .
on the contrary , these measure will have the opposite effect .
this mean that adequate long-term funding for the cap is required .
hunger is a scourge that is affecting increasing number of people .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next point is the three draft resolution on nicaragua .
amnesty international wrote of the violence which followed local authority election .
they return to power only to misuse it once again .
for example , we could and should have discussed the western sahara .
( de ) mr president , i agree wholeheartedly with the previous speaker .
there wa a debate about this at least in germany .
therefore , let u concentrate on far more important matter .
a a member of the fdp , i explicitly reject this claim .
mr president , nicaragua remains one of the poorest country in the america .
daniel ortega ha failed his people and his country many time over .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the next item is the four draft resolution on lao and vietnam .
she is diabetic and in a poor state of health .
mr president , the human right situation in vietnam is disturbing .
they have not been granted the status of refugee .
any claim that these people are returning voluntarily are simply not true .
( the president asked the member to speak more slowly )
once again , a huge amount of political will is required .
thus , christian are going from being victim to being criminal .
it is not a favour granted by whoever hold power .
however , we share the concern of parliament regarding political prisoner .
the authority claim to have no knowledge of mr bouvanh chanmanivong .
however , we have not been able to confirm the information referred to .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
china : minority right and application of the death penalty
china is a gigantic sweatshop of exploitation of worker .
recently a socialist colleague of my own wa banned from china .
'chinaworker.info ' campaign for worker ' right and free trade union .
mr president , in recent year , china ha seen huge economic growth .
many chinese people 's quality of life ha improved .
however , sadly , china is the world leader in execution .
in 2008 alone , at least 1 718 people were executed .
the estimated number of unreported case is much higher .
the principle of this resolution are one i share .
china is a powerful player on the world stage .
the city still retains this spirit of freedom today .
they range from terrorising people in munich through to death penalty in ürümqi .
this is why we must make our opinion quite clear in this regard .
i would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation .
the group of hungarian meps from transylvania also proposed this issue for discussion .
we would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere .
the primacy of economics continues to be victorious over value and human right .
our policy towards china is one of constructive engagement .
the strength of our relationship allows u to discus these matter frankly .
i would like to recall some essential element that the eu position encompasses .
tibet 's situation ha invariably been approached a such .
the eu support any effort that will help reconciliation in this region .
we must , however , see more action than just diplomatic gesture .
the most important project relates to the reduction in incidence of violence .
pakistan is the most crucial country in term of global security .
therefore , no abstention , but no participation either .
mr president , our speech take exactly the same perspective .
the word 'criminal ' and 'disciplinary ' will be removed from this paragraph .
china : minority right and application of the death penalty ( vote )
uighur are not other tibetan and tibetan are not other uighur .
mr posselt , thank you , that will be corrected .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
political discussion must not be conducted in such a fashion .
this wa intended to break up and destroy the solidarity trade union .
this event , therefore , hold particular value for u .
i wa speaking on behalf of the entire european parliament .
we are ardent opponent of mr berlusconi , but we are political adversary .
i do not intend to engage in political speculation of any kind .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
it wa a written request submitted to the bureau of the european parliament .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the first step in this matter should be taken by the european council .
i am continually appealing for the council to take the appropriate step .
president chávez ha closed down thirty radio station and some television channel .
the continuous fall of nut price threatens the future of our european producer .
these are the worry i wanted to share with you .
i should like to convey their concern about iran 's nuclear programme .
the progress report say one thing and mr erdoğan say another .
i would like to talk in simple term here .
human right defender in tunisia are being scorned , arrested and humiliated .
my request ha been signed by 75 member and five political group .
there have recently been intensive and generally positive development in the region .
it is up to them to make use of it .
that will be a great day and an opportunity for celebration .
that last statement , however , is highly questionable .
the number of armed attack also rose by 200 % overall .
the financial efficiency of this operation is also highly questionable .
i think that this absurdity is unacceptable in europe .
at this moment , the main link is the via baltica ...
secondly , i would like to make the comment that child require protection .
i assume that the european parliament will vigorously oppose any tendency towards anti-semitism .
at the moment , these tendency are frequent and widespread .
infringement proceeding are currently being brought against the portuguese state .
colleague , we have come to the end of the one-minute speech .
we must pay attention to those who have not spoken at all .
i am sorry but those are just the rule .
i am very sorry that not everybody could take the floor .
i do not think we should speak in such a way .
crisis in agricultural sector other than the dairy sector ( debate )
in the pigmeat sector , the situation is still fragile .
this ha affected the fruit and vegetable price that producer obtained .
for this reason , the commission reactivated private storage aid earlier this year .
we saw that the market reacted immediately and price recovered steadily .
a far a we can see , consumption will recover .
to summarise , i see some timid sign of recovery .
i am sure we will come back to these important issue a well .
the fact is that other farming sector are also affected by this .
we need reliable planning in agriculture , and agricultural policy must be sustainable .
that is something that we have also advocated for a long time .
the price are falling for farmer , but not for consumer .
farmer must not merely be producer of raw material .
we hope that our cooperation with the new commission will be constructive .
indeed , small- and medium-sized farm can no longer cope .
unfortunately , this currently only occurs on a limited basis .
you should know that anger is rife among peach producer in greece .
we must support protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication product .
this will raise a question mark over food supply security in europe .
we are now at the mercy of external market .
but helping farmer is not just about agricultural policy .
we should be working here in a holistic way .
we have that opportunity coming up in this parliament early next year .
we warned against the consequence of liberalising international trade in agri-foodstuffs .
that is why we have opposed cancelling production aid and ending milk quota .
this problem will resurface again within a year or so .
the last financial year wa one of the worst of the decade .
economic crisis expose deficiency - deficiency caused by people .
crisis only become disaster if nothing is done about them .
thirdly , the legal authority of producer organisation must be significantly improved .
there are roadblock and demonstration by farmer throughout the region .
this mean that europe is paying to have more desert !
a succession of new animal welfare measure is being introduced .
there are , no doubt , many reason for this .
one of them is probably the liberalisation of agricultural policy in recent year .
this is causing ever greater problem for our farmer .
we need to find democratic solution for our future agricultural policy .
we have a continuous safety net , which is the direct payment .
that is certainly in place , and that is accountable for the farmer .
i expect the next commission to present such a proposal .
it is already possible for farmer to do this .
but new initiative can not be presented by a caretaker commission .
the reduction in or elimination of it non-agricultural income , while :
how will the commission ensure that the core negotiation are focused on development ?
our priority list , of course , begin with the doha development agenda .
doha is the best trade policy instrument available on both those front .
the european union must therefore adopt a clear position .
the economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade .
now we need to bring the negotiation to a conclusion .
for this to happen , we need a signal of political will .
the european union can and must play a leading role in this .
we must now also raise the public 's awareness .
we therefore need a conclusion to the doha round now .
in the meantime , however , the negotiation have failed twice .
it ha resulted in an enormous pressure for rationalisation in the industrialised state .
we call for a new start to the process .
the balance of our global economic order is disastrous .
is this the economic development model that europe should be proposing to european ?
this is the only relocation that europe could welcome .
a trade deficit increase of this magnitude is unsustainable .
fish caught off europe 's shore is frozen and then shipped to china .
the current trade system encourages the growth of co2 emission .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
they are emerging economy , industrialised country and very self-aware .
the doha development round wa certainly meant to be a development round .
globalisation can be a blessing , and not a curse .
the period between these report are getting shorter and shorter .
sweden ha applied for eur 9.8 million from the fund for this .
for this purpose , austria ha applied for eur 5.7 million .
the first budgetary point you raise relates to funding source .
this activity is performed on a case-by-case basis , according to need .
this is not merely a result of the similar nature of this fund .
mr president , unusual time call for unusual measure .
europe 's action is rightly aimed at preserving expertise and skill .
i am pleased to note the convergence of goodwill .
however , our role should not just be to approve this fund .
i would like to present two argument in support of this position .
this is just a waste of taxpayer ' money .
how can we treat their money with such contempt ?
i will reject this resolution , and urge you to do the same .
that is something positive that the european union doe for it citizen .
the request are again accompanied by a whole series of ambiguity .
the support in austria is not being granted to just one person .
export have paved the way for new business and large enterprise to emerge .
the european union can not provide such opportunity from a single fund .
we were against the creation of such a fund .
the economic crisis ha had a drastic impact on global trade .
this is why i believe that the procedure must be simple .
firstly , i think the start date need to be looked at .
the fund thus operates without discrimination and doe not disadvantage anyone .
thus , in my opinion , there are no fundamental obstacle here .
european microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion ( progress ) ( debate )
i therefore think that this clarification is an important one .
this is a debate on microfinance and not on the progress programme .
i would also like to welcome commissioner špidla to the following debate .
parliament wa extremely willing to compromise during the debate .
this progress is reflected to a considerable extent in the amendment proposed today .
of course , the most difficult question is the budget .
you have decided not to vote on this second proposal this week .
the proposal for microfinancing is an initiative that parliament ha been pushing for .
let u think of butcher , baker , greengrocer or perhaps even chemist .
in certain case , they need temporary working credit and temporary assistance .
the european parliament is going to assume it responsibility .
this would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship .
obviously , many finance minister did not support real negotiation .
micro-credits are also an important instrument for supporting the social economy .
however , they do not use it for micro-credits .
our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation .
unemployment can not be lastingly combated in this way .
in this form , we will reject this programme .
this data underline the importance of investing in entrepreneurship .
madam president , i very much welcome this initiative .
however , this sector will not disappear from the world economy .
the financial and economic crisis is also a social crisis .
the reference to specific group should therefore be deleted .
today the economic crisis is growing into a social crisis .
such an approach is not responsible , and it is unacceptable .
economic growth take place when new job are created .
this will convince people that the institution are effective and close to them .
for many year , we have been discussing financial support for these enterprise .
i think we can neutralise this risk with this financing .
i would be interested to know what the socialist ' position actually is .
should the instrument be financed from progress - yes or no ?
eur 100 million is not going to turn that situation around .
this mechanism must be put in place quickly , in january 2010 .
i welcome the idea presented in the commission proposal .
questioning the jurisdiction of european policy is certainly permissible in this area .
for such people , the term 'putative self-employed ' would be more appropriate .
the member state must also take appropriate precautionary step in this regard .
it is the issue of financing that remains open .
it wa only able to use money which wa available .
however , it is also very important to make use of time .
we are unable to find any other kind of resource .
i believe that this reflects parliament 's constructive approach .
i think that more attention need to be focused on young people .
the next item is the statement from the commission on toy safety .
the first is a question that is very easy to answer .
in this case , lady and gentleman , the rule are perfectly clear .
thus , i think the answer to this question is fairly clear .
this view wa also shared by the council and by parliament .
there have been indication twice this year that new finding may be available .
the second case is rather complicated and difficult to explain .
we can not understand them because we have not received the relevant education .
a politician , how can we decide when scientist disagree with each other ?
it is pure scandal mongering and the scientist there know that .
however , this substance represents a group of around a hundred others .
thus , you need to multiply the reference value by one hundred .
the content is defined in term of the smallest measurable content .
it really is intolerable that we have to deal with such thing .
i have listened to him heaping blame on scientist .
the debate on toy and safety should really be held throughout the year .
malignant tumour are the second most common cause of death in child .
seventy percent of toy sold are below these threshold .
it is extremely important for u to act quickly .
we ought to be able to do better than this .
when can we expect a standard stating maximum noise level for toy ?
once again , we were told that this would be resolved via standardisation .
another million will be recalled from the canadian market .
it is a question of the protection of our child .
however , i think that thing need to move more quickly .
it is a question of the protection of our child .
i want to make that point here , too .
i can not do that and neither can you .
you can not force scientist to produce finding within a particular timeframe .
i am sorry , but that is not possible .
mr creutzmann , the principle of using the lowest possible risk is valid .
the requirement that you derived from this are therefore also met .
it will surprise you when i say that i did exactly that .
i would be happy to provide you with the text .
mr davidson , we have the most stringent legislation in the world .
i agree with you entirely that the question of implementation is crucial here .
in this regard , too , we have made appropriate preparation .
the last question from mr hedh is a very important one .
the relevant instruction have been sent to the european standardisation organisation .
there is one last point i would like to address .
we need not hide from the american in this regard .
i would like to ask that this matter be thoroughly investigated .
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
we got started immediately on formulating parliament 's political expectation and directive .
these matter were discussed by parliament in the spring of this year .
i think that we should also adopt the same timing in subsequent year .
we knew that europe 's economy wa in crisis .
it is not a solution , but it may help the situation .
more than eur 11 billion are being allocated for these purpose .
we wanted to boost the economy , mainly via the cohesion policy .
most importantly , there is sufficient support for everything in this chamber .
i saw many unused opportunity and shortcoming that i wanted to sort out .
the aim is to bring about a more efficient use of resource .
i would like to applaud the great professionalism of the swedish presidency .
i believe that this work will produce successful result .
the 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution .
i hope that we will all work towards this .
of course , it wa not an economic recovery package .
we are expecting a total of eur 300 million .
this agreement serf two different , but equally important , purpose .
firstly , let me point out some key element of the conciliation outcome .
it is a budget designed to fight unemployment and kick-start the economy .
in this regard , i have a direct question for the swedish presidency .
i would be very grateful for your thought on this .
a others have done , i would like to highlight two thing .
are there any programme that are not working very well ?
in my group , we do not advocate the contravention of existing agreement .
if people are dissatisfied with the system , they must change the system .
it is now time to review thing once again .
this is just something for you to think about , mr šemeta .
we have now more or le resolved these problem .
this is the only way to create new job .
this is the main resource that we have in the european union .
there is one thing that i would like to add .
all budget are supposed to be mirror image of some economic policy consideration .
it doe not reflect any consistent set of common value .
many meps are concentrating on pet project and pork-barrel spending .
we all know it would not . that is the crucial issue .
the report itself add further criticism , like those made by mr haug .
the council must know all too well how such fund are used .
in the current circumstance , we should renounce any increase .
one might ask how much this will amount to .
colleague , listen to your conscience and vote against this budget .
bulgaria ha decided to close the kozloduy nuclear power plant immediately .
for me , three thing are important in this area .
this budget will make eur 141 billion available for next year .
the focus is on two budget line : competitiveness and the environment .
this budget line will be allocated about eur 65 billion for next year .
these account for approximately 35.5 % of europe 's total budget .
55 % of member state are under this average .
altogether , that mean that eur 4.3 billion wa planned for ...
i hope that this will be money well spent and not wasted .
i welcome the fact that the milk fund ha been established .
they are not getting enough nor receiving enough help from their national government .
the northern ireland assembly ha the responsibility of administering the fund .
they are about 18 month behind in distribution of these fund .
i should like to make one observation in this connection , however .
matter not falling within the european domain include education , culture and citizenship .
for this , i would particularly like to congratulate the commissioner .
the truth is that today we can consider this to be a success .
we have just signed a treaty , but we need a new spirit .
anyway , we are now talking about the 2010 budget .
i should like to make a couple of brief remark .
will the european contribution really make our economy fit for the future ?
in other word , do we choose stagnation or progress ?
essentially , this permanently excludes the potential for an independent eu foreign policy .
we have all been turned into prima facie suspect .
that just lead to hostility and ultimately to conflict .
the rapporteur had some harsh word for the modification .
he said that the commission wa raiding the main area .
what are the cost of the treaty of lisbon ?
why can we not be more realistic with regard to the structural fund ?
i would like to call for a realistic approach to kozloduy .
plan have simply been made for managing the decommissioning process .
i believe that this is evidence of what is happening in europe .
other sector of agricultural production are also having problem at the moment .
given the current situation , this creates even more difficulty .
this budget mark the absence of a global vision for europe .
there ha been no leverage attempt , no encouraging of european solidarity .
mr president , i should like to make four point .
these are global difficulty and require coordinated response at the highest level .
i would like to emphasise one further last point .
the second point is the inclusion of eu staff pension in the budget .
the third point is that the anti-fraud office should be supported .
i wish to thank everybody involved in this process .
i hope those declaration are remembered when we decide on policy post-2013 .
we should make sure that the budget in the future meet our priority .
at the moment , that amount is not enough .
they will contribute to sustainable development and job creation .
they have done what they have done for year .
i think that this would be an important public service .
there is a sort of growing belief that there is a faceless bureaucracy .
this particular budget is , in consequence , loaded with responsibility .
the increase in spending on research and innovation is justified .
i would also like to mention that there are some problematic area .
the entire fund amount to more than eur 6.6 billion .
we have to be very clear on what we have to do next .
mr president , i think this ha been an exciting debate .
we have had differing view and that is how it should be .
finally , we also have the european central bank 's very expansive policy .
lady and gentleman , thank you for your inspiring speech .
i appreciate the cooperation of the swedish presidency and the commissioner .
without them we would not have achieved today 's result .
mr president , i would like to thank all my fellow member .
we have managed to find a common position with regard to the council .
this concern adjusting , renewing and enhancing the interinstitutional agreement .
it is about the codecision procedure in the financial regulation .
we also support research and development , a well a lifelong learning .
the commission and member state share particular responsibility for future success .
the vote on jutta haug 's report will take place tomorrow .
the additional cost for accessibility are always much higher .
the budget for 2010 is the last one in this structure .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.25 and resumed at 12.00 )
european microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion ( progress ) (
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
mr president , we were in favour of this proposal .
i believe that it should be our duty to increase this financial resource .
however , i am opposed to the european union carrying out this function .
this microfinance facility is complementary to other programme that support employment and inclusion .
that of creating paperwork , and of financing study and report .
i voted in favour of the göncz report on the european microfinance facility .
this is a special instrument in the fight against banking exclusion and poverty .
mr president , i voted in favour of the report on microfinance facility .
it is difficult to achieve such goal without this kind of support facility .
this new instrument also allows u to respond to the continuing credit crunch .
in view of these aspect , i endorse the report .
it is important that this programme retains it funding in full .
progress is supposed to serve the development of micro-enterprises and the social economy .
the council , in particular , reject a separate budget .
the microfinance instrument ha no coherence and no long-term vision .
i say an emphatic 'no ' , then , to this report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
there is a much greater sense of social urgency than before .
it wa obvious that the previous model of growth wa dilapidated .
i would like to ask a brief additional question , mr barroso .
i am always ready to listen to your suggestion and to your comment .
mr president , my question concern the situation in greece .
yet we , too , can do something , president barroso .
let u compare the interest rate payable in germany and the united state .
this is proof that we urgently need to take that course .
i definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility .
we do not believe that this is the case .
it is not because of the role of the president in this case .
there will be a lot to do after copenhagen .
she will have a dedicated dg for climate change .
at the same time , i would like to raise two matter .
we want to help them to be closer to u .
mr president , i have a question for you about the tobin tax .
we have to think of innovative way of financing .
i hope the new commission will put forward some proposal in this area .
this doe have some consequence in term of the adaptation of our industry .
president of the commission . - i will answer by saying 'no ' .
it will , of course , be applicable during other debate .
i am not going to make hypothetical statement about hypothetical referendum .
mr le pen , you are asking a hypothetical question .
'if there were a referendum ' , that is a hypothetical question .
i am not in the habit of answering hypothetical question .
the principle of loyalty between the different institution is very important .
i think now we have an opportunity to do it .
frankly , it ha been refused several time before .
i am encouraged by the first exchange of view with the european council .
( fr ) mr barroso , the lisbon strategy ha had it day .
small and medium-sized enterprise are the one that create job .
we started to deal with the list at 15.00 .
mr kallas wa in charge of this issue in the previous commission .
president barroso , i welcome your vision for 2020 .
please do not say one thing and do another .
president of the commission . - congratulation to cambridge .
i think we should not use one thing or the other .
2010 will be the european year against poverty and social exclusion .
which question do you prefer - the first or the second ?
let u see if we agree on this matter .
i am telling you the position that i will be defending .
i hope all the member state will be ready to support this view .
we should treat our social partner a little more seriously .
this is very clear in my statement of support for the measure announced .
i trust those measure will have some important result .
in 2020 there will be four to seven new member state at least .
this wa our third question hour with the president of the european commission .
thank you very much , colleague , for putting forward question for discussion .
the first 30 minute were with the other group leader .
can we not have an hour and a half ?
mr barroso , you are on a good enough salary , sir .
president barroso is smiling very politely , but we will see .
recently , the israeli government announced a partial and temporary settlement freeze .
i would like to say a few more word about gaza .
we look forward to free and fair election when condition permit .
our diplomat in the region have followed the situation in east jerusalem closely .
in their view , israel is weakening the palestinian community in the city .
another aspect of concern , of course , is the situation in gaza .
we have consistently called for the flow of aid , trade and person .
we now need to think about how we can re-engage a political process .
negotiation should be based on international law and respect previous agreement .
they should also take place within an agreed timeframe with effective mediation .
i am here to make sure europe work effectively and harmoniously .
today , however , the palestinian are divided both politically and physically .
credible negotiation require a strong and united palestinian partner .
israel stand to gain , not lose , from a strong palestinian partner .
israel ha taken a first step with it temporary and partial settlement freeze .
we hope this will contribute towards a resumption of meaningful negotiation .
the u remains an indispensable and crucial actor in the middle east .
peace in the middle east requires a comprehensive solution .
both syria and lebanon have an important role to play .
we look forward to the implementation of the arab peace initiative .
a multilateral framework should complement the israeli-palestinian bilateral framework .
this is all about a common foreign and security policy .
in some way , it may not be important where you sit .
i would ask you , baroness ashton , to take this to heart .
we have great sympathy for the situation in israel .
what happened to a delegation from parliament is also completely unacceptable .
mr de rossa will also give his view on this .
why is it preventing member of parliament from going to gaza ?
i hope that the israeli authority realise the importance of this development .
the head of mission statement and report show practical way of doing so .
are all party able and willing to work for peace ?
this wa a gesture to help bring about peace talk .
is the palestinian side willing and able to bring about further talk ?
around 500 000 settler are living in these settlement today .
mr president , ha europe taken leave of it sens ?
i distance myself emphatically from the proposal to divide jerusalem , in particular .
i have several fundamental objection to the said council statement .
this is an established european formula , is it not ?
israel is the only functioning democracy in the region .
the favourite tactic of it opponent have been terrorism against the state .
that is not the act of a friendly state .
where there is hopelessness , there will be violence .
we must use access to our market to incentivise israel .
so the question is : what are we going to do about it ?
we know they are strong , because the israeli government immediately dismissed them .
so the question remains : where is the policy ?
i would now like to quote three of the recommendation from the report .
what step do you plan to take now to implement them ?
yes , freedom for gilad shalit , but also for salah hamouri !
we saw the hopeful smile on the face of the palestinian representative .
we have to remember that the european union must stand by it value .
furthermore , israel is the only democratic country in the middle east .
this show what the palestinian administration and hamas think about the european union .
they have no respect whatsoever for our principle or our value .
israel is a democracy ; it value are the same a our own .
the middle east peace process ha no need for woolly pronouncement .
the european union is not taking any practical step in this direction .
last week , our delegation wa refused entry to gaza by israel .
a elector , we can choose to pay the cost of peace .
a consumer , we do not want to subsidise the price of conflict .
democracy , dear colleague , is a precondition for peace .
i hope that she will continue to do so .
you can not boycott and engage at the same time .
mr president , thank you for a very constructive debate .
it is important for the eu and the u to work closely together .
i am sitting here because the council is over there .
one is the rather political issue that you quite rightly raise .
the european union ha a major role to play .
in the fight against terrorism , however , the eu is le principled .
unfortunately , the current system is characterised by abuse of fundamental right .
i advocate transparent procedure and due legal process for everyone .
it is time we had transparent , democratic procedure .
the question is whether we can count on your cooperation .
mr president , i am afraid the portuguese interpretation is not working .
i have not heard one single word from the previous speaker .
something must be done ; otherwise , i can not follow the debate .
the first decade of the 21st century is coming to an end .
however , the european union must punish those responsible .
doe that mean that it ha to forget it most fundamental principle ?
let me start by explaining how the council us these measure .
then i will talk about the treaty of lisbon .
all sanction are reviewed regularly to ass their effectiveness .
they may be adjusted or lifted completely , depending on the development .
the european parliament shall be informed of any such decision .
however , that is how we interpret the treaty .
therefore , the sanction clearly must respect human right and the fundamental freedom .
this relates to procedural right and the right to legal protection .
the measure must also always be proportionate to the objective .
these resolution are binding for eu member state under international law .
that period expires at the end of this year .
i would emphasise 'the full involvement of your parliament . '
with them wa a leading sikh i have come to know .
furthermore , war against muslim country only provoke terrorist outrage .
we are the most competent people for the job .
however , the council ha sole authority in this area .
in principle , article 215 seems to be the most appropriate .
mr malmström , we are just beginning to implement the treaty of lisbon .
i think we would all like to begin in the best way possible .
i am simply clarifying my position , mr president .
i think the evidence is there that they have done a good job .
the second point i wanted to make wa this issue of good cooperation .
the third and final thing i would say is about legal certainty .
it is extremely important a the lisbon treaty come into effect .
it is extremely important that we reach a conclusion on this .
a i said , we have achieved a huge amount .
it say that we need to further enhance democracy .
however , it is not just about law and regulation .
the meeting took place on the initiative of the swedish presidency .
we also need to discus how this type of objective should be realised .
you have become the face , the symbol and the advocate of it .
we all agree that this is a most welcome development .
we are still in the stage of the first reading .
the lisbon treaty lay down a legal framework for participatory democracy .
what answer doe he want from the commission and the council ?
so much for your claim to be fighting for transparency .
the report wa and is a dossier in the codecision procedure .
you only need to think about the agreement with the u on swift .
the european parliament ha already done a lot of work in this area .
an improved regulation would establish a better level of transparency .
otherwise , a history ha always shown , power corrupts .
european society is made up of different nation which live in particular country .
it is important that not only parliament have full access to these document .
lady and gentleman , this debate hinge on a question of trust .
the european institution are always asking the citizen to trust them .
the financial crisis started , and they asked the citizen to trust them .
this strike me a the only truly clear message .
the treaty of lisbon endorses this fundamental right of eu citizen .
if the european parliament doe not defend this fundamental right , who will ?
we were waiting for the european parliament 's opinion before we could continue .
pending this , there is much we can do .
thank you very much mr cashman and parliament for raising this issue .
to do that , we need a first reading from parliament .
that is the main difference , a we see it in the commission .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 december 2009 .
the subject that we are now going to debate is georgia .
georgia 's goal is , of course , to achieve stability and prosperity .
the eu is prepared to provide assistance for this .
the mandate ha now been extended until september 2010 .
our focus is on measure to promote trust between the party .
the monitoring mission will continue to work with the party involved .
however , it must be seen in it entirety and not viewed selectively .
we will raise these issue in our talk with russia .
and internally , last year 's conflict ha increased tension within georgia .
so disputed election , for instance , led to month of street protest .
we are not sparing any effort to support georgia .
enhanced mobility will go hand in hand with enhanced security .
this leaf the great majority of people in georgia feeling decidedly insecure .
all this affect the eu - hence the significance of the eastern partnership .
russian tank do not bring democracy , russian tank bring subjugation .
i am not saying that everything in georgia is ideal .
there is certainly much which need to be improved .
ha that matter ever even been mentioned to the russian ?
no , it is an act of brutal imperialism .
we , a the european union , should oppose that brutal imperialism .
the reckoning will come in the form of the gas dispute .
at my primary school , we had to learn several new song .
the occupation wa bad in every way ; only that song wa nice .
that is exactly what he say : 'she wa provocative ' !
we always support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia .
i refer to the dramatic humanitarian and human situation .
ethnic cleansing is being carried out in georgian territory .
have you seen what georgia 's army did with zhinvali ?
at the beginning of november , several teenager became victim of this .
last but not least , though , i want to make a request .
the eu should take a stronger position on this case .
commissioner , you mentioned eur 46 million in aid .
mr president , politics is merely a job when it is self-serving .
these are similar aspiration to be closer to the european union .
it seems that this is a problem for u .
this will be a much more difficult situation for u .
there is also the greatest progress in market reform .
we will also provide further financial assistance for the aftermath of the conflict .
now , the only remaining international presence is the eu monitoring mission .
it is making a significant contribution to security and to normalisation .
it is important for georgia 's security and stability .
the eu will continue to be very active in this matter .
the eur 500 million package wa the biggest package i could bring through .
these are issue that we do of course mention to the russian .
a regard the principle , of course we are clear on the principle .
she wa then my special representative for the caucasus .
this also help because the report ha made the fact clear .
we have to ask them also to do their part .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.55 and resumed at 21.00 )
some economy were better prepared to withstand the blow of the crisis .
we are , of course , also seeing significant challenge .
it is therefore true that there are a great many difficulty .
it is true that these country have more fragile economy .
of course , what is best is to give a fishing-rod .
the difficulty is to know what kind of fishing-rod it should really be .
the cornerstone and gauge of recovery is the creation of new job .
in order for this to happen , investment is needed .
the european union is formed on the basis of the solidarity principle .
the figure relating to their economic growth are really very negative .
firstly , the central bank must also provide liquidity to local bank .
we have to discus the social perspective a well .
the european union 's neoliberal social security policy must be changed .
we must not forget , however that miracle happen only in fairy tale .
the term for gaining access to credit are a fundamental issue .
the existing opportunity and resource must be used sensibly .
similarly , fiscal problem are bigger in the euro area than outside it .
it is difficult in these time to make cut .
in this context , hypocrisy is not a tribute to virtue .
the market wa to be god ; competition wa to be king .
what do the eu commission and mr verhofstadt offer ?
the prescription of the international monetary fund and of the western european bank .
you may laugh , commissioner , but i await your response .
an alarming number of member state have high level of national debt .
secondly , we must support small and medium-sized enterprise .
their very presence at this debate is where solidarity begin .
member state in south-eastern europe are faced with huge deficit .
to conclude , we have to move on from word to deed .
however , they can not learn off their own bat .
we also need to give them the financial resource to do so .
all these factor may condemn the country of central europe ...
what do you think about the exchange rate policy ?
therefore , the country of central and eastern europe need ...
these are the various exchange rate mechanism and many other thing .
i am very grateful to you for your contribution and idea .
allow me to begin with a phrase used by mr verhofstadt .
this is the problem that we should be concerned with .
the commission is asking the council and parliament to do so .
i would be very grateful if you could say this to the council .
i cited these straight away when i first spoke .
they can not depend solely and exclusively on finance from foreign investment .
we must increase the take-up rate of the structural fund .
4 % of annual gdp and this money is not being used adequately .
this is also something to consider for the future .
however , our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment .
only this help u effectively stand against any future crisis .
all of these action should focus on one thing - social policy .
the clear leader of country in the region with favourable result is poland .
equally a important a action at national level is external help .
now a joint effort is required to strengthen the european union 's cohesion .
the new member state will definitely be it main victim .
it is very important and the content of the communication is very convincing .
we should consider whether other method for inspecting meat would be appropriate .
we need reliable planning for the area which apply regulation .
this is specifically why i am opposed to the intended regulation .
this should further contribute to ensuring transparency and legal certainty .
however , this suggestion is still pending , a you know .
this information provides essential data to ensure a risk based inspection .
the food hygiene regulation specifies the hygiene rule for meat production .
we have a duty to support , acknowledge and assist them .
the commission ha a dual role in this area .
we have devoted a budget of eur 200 000 to it .
this is confirmed by the adoption of the stockholm programme .
we have constructed a common discourse based on four pillar .
in politics , we need to learn to put ourselves in their shoe .
there have even been government implicated in terrorist action .
this is not , however , a question of principle .
i dedicate this speech to all the victim of terrorism .
here is some incidental , illustrative information : terrorism equal victim .
secondly , it requires swift and effective compensation for the damage suffered .
thirdly , it requires equal treatment for all victim .
seventhly , it requires education and teaching against violence in the population .
terrorism threatens our way of life and our freedom .
help for victim and their family is not only a moral imperative .
i would like to add to the remark made by mr jáuregui atondo .
in my opinion , we need to start with education and information .
in addition , this house must clearly reject the brutalisation of language .
we are constantly calling for tolerance in many area .
a mr lópez aguilar said , terrorism is a terrible form of crime .
next , we must ensure that they receive compensation quickly .
that is what i wished to say in response to the various speech .
rest assured that they have left neither mr almunia nor i indifferent .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
the eu institution are champion of the prerogative of freedom .
i am obliged to adhere to a number of rule of law .
those are the point that i wanted to clear up .
we are therefore going to try to clarify a few thing .
there is therefore no reason for any member state to be concerned .
this verdict trample underfoot freedom of religion and the cultural heritage of europe .
i am not speaking a a lawyer , but a a politician .
however , we have a wide range of different model in europe .
i would even like to take thing a step further .
this is because they are based on our culture and our religion .
that is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this .
however , there is also the right to have a faith .
this is also legitimate in term of religious freedom .
the decision is simple , clear and universally comprehensible .
the citizen of church state can not defend their right before national court .
should we do away with the very name of the red cross ?
the issue therefore go beyond the question of crucifix .
obviously we must abide by the principle of subsidiarity .
( sk ) i would like to respond briefly to three point .
my four child go to school with catholic child .
equality law have failed to protect christian - indeed , quite the opposite .
christian ought to be protected , and not punished , by the law .
that is where i believe this debate should really take place .
i am obliged to say this , quite simply .
that is what i can say for my part , a a lawyer .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 december 2009 .
it is certainly not about calling into question the freedom of religion .
however , this respect is exactly what it is all about .
therefore , it doe not violate the freedom of religion .
you answered that this is now up to the council .
i am thinking about that and taking care about that very strongly .
we , too , will decide who is invited and in what order .
in addition , i think your remark are premature .
the council statement on the result of the swedish presidency ;
in just two day , the un climate conference will be over .
is it because we fear any change of our way of life ?
we have much greater thing than our everyday comfort to fear .
so , what do we need to do in copenhagen ?
i have sat down with the indian and chinese leadership .
that is why we must work together to solve the problem .
from our side , we can compensate for year of irresponsible behaviour .
we can help finance climate action in the developing world .
it is not the form that matter in copenhagen but the substance .
it wa a fast and impressive response but it came with a price .
let me briefly touch on what we have done .
when financial flow are international , supervision can no longer be national .
the swedish presidency took place during a period of institutional change .
when we took over on 1 july , this parliament wa newly elected .
we had not yet appointed a president of the european commission .
the outcome of the then pending irish referendum wa uncertain .
the presidency now had a stable counterpart in the commission to work with .
the outcome of the irish referendum wa a victory for ireland .
it brought u one step closer to the treaty of lisbon .
a few day later , the czech president signed .
immediately after the signature , i started to consult my colleague again .
the treaty of lisbon could finally enter into force .
now , the european union will be more efficient .
the new president of the european council will ensure continuity .
the high representative will assure coordination in our external relation .
a new era for the european union ha begun .
there wa uncertainty on the transition of the new treaty .
i would like to end by thanking all of you .
he ha been a tremendous support to me and to the swedish presidency .
there were many other issue that were the object of the european council .
i presented the scene for our european 2020 strategy .
the european council had a particular significance for climate change .
i hope the money is now guaranteed , not just an aspiration .
what can we expect over the next few day ?
the leader ' task will be to move this forward to a deal .
this is why i am going to copenhagen immediately after this debate .
we know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at copenhagen .
i hope that with european leadership , we will achieve success at copenhagen .
i now expect our partner to do the same .
in other word , i expect copenhagen not to mislead europe .
our fellow citizen want more security , but also respect for public freedom .
we still have the swedish prime minister here today .
that ha been the fate of mr reinfeldt over the last few month .
thank goodness , that ha now come to an end .
that is what i expect from mr van rompuy , for example .
the swedish presidency ha put in a lot of effort .
i therefore believe that the treaty of lisbon represents progress .
we must think about whether or not we want a conference .
a sense of purpose must be shown in this proposal .
there are a lot of leading role to lose in copenhagen .
mr reinfeldt , you do , of course , deserve our thanks .
unfortunately , i am forced , here , to say some severe word .
we spoke about this yesterday during the debate on georgia .
i think israel is the only democracy in the middle east .
the netherlands pay out a large amount of money .
this situation must be rectified a soon a possible .
we hope that the next presidency will show more courage .
just a few comment on trying to coordinate 27 member state .
we only stand for 13 % of global emission .
a few word on sweden , since that wa mentioned .
concerning that , we have presented these kind of figure .
no other player ha done anything comparable so far .
so let u ask others to do something similar to our effort .
we also spoke with meles zenawi of ethiopia and others .
it is a global problem and we need a global solution .
nevertheless , mr reinfeldt , i can not give your presidency full mark .
it comprehensive jurisdiction is increasing , from the environment to financial policy .
at the same time , you are closing the door ever tighter .
this is not what transparent debate by representative of the people look like .
nevertheless , i would like to thank you for the last six month .
part of the stockholm programme simply fail to get the balance right .
the swedish national administration ha lived up to everyone 's expectation .
two area in particular must come in for criticism .
why ha the swedish presidency not acted on this ?
with sweden , turkey is also losing an advocate for it accession .
despite many problem , the swedish council presidency ha done a splendid job .
i would like to thank you and your entire government , mr reinfeldt .
we have listened to the criticism from the communist and the green .
they do not have any actual responsibility anywhere in europe .
i reject the claim that greenpeace is the yardstick for european climate policy .
i would like to express my sincere thanks for this , too .
can i say 'sweden ante porta ' , mr reinfeldt ?
the first thing is the implementation of the lisbon treaty .
a treaty is never enough for solving a problem .
should we call into question the wisdom of enlargement ?
but the conclusion is a follows , and i will end here .
it would be a case of robbing peter to pay paul .
we await clarification from the european council and the commission on this matter .
( de ) mr president , we need a revolution in democracy .
during this presidency , you have been a rather different person .
why did you adopt swift at such a late stage ?
please use your future to return to your root .
what is going on and why is there no common position ?
there is no common position on at least two issue .
we are entitled to the right to sell excess quota .
however , the commission still want to take this from u .
all thing considered , however , there remain one or two mixed result .
with the czech republic , or some other great presidency ?
neither should anyone expect to get good mark from mr borghezio .
in fact , getting poor mark from mr borghezio is a good result .
the two highest post in the eu have been filled .
it represents continued legal uncertainty and unnecessary suffering a people wait for treatment .
i would therefore ask everyone to be a bit fairer and calmer .
the council presidency ha done a good job over the last six month .
however , none of u want a europe of government .
each one of u is a part of the european union .
the decision on financial market supervision ha still not been finalised .
the third relates to the schengen area for the free movement of person .
( sv ) mr president , building bridge is never easy .
she did a fantastic job and we greatly miss her .
to do this , we need an integration policy .
it is already possible to see stabilisation in the economy .
we consider these result to be very positive a well .
however , certain essential issue have been relegated to secondary status .
they will have to save it for another time .
sweden know much more about this than some other country .
this wa done against the will of many nation .
your footprint will remain with u for five year .
i would like therefore to endorse it position and it decision .
the financial crisis ha revealed the weak point in our financial supervision system .
it is an industry that ha had to rely on nephrops .
i think we have , at most , a renewed union .
this is very much in the hand of the member state .
thank you again also for the cooperation we have had with parliament .
thank you for your activity and for your energy .
it ha not been an easy presidency ; we know that .
this discussion is not just about 2020 ; it is for after 2020 .
mr president , assessment of the swedish presidency yield a very positive result .
i equally welcome the development in the area of justice and internal affair .
i shall put all my effort into it and will monitor it closely .
i just wanted to make sure that the vote have been recorded correctly .
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
in my opinion it is therefore necessary to set out firm criterion .
it will ensure this long before international trade doe .
we are not , of course , even in favour of eu membership .
this fund is an unwelcome substitute for help by member state .
swedish , austrian and dutch worker are being sacrificed to globalisation .
that spirit is the context for the european globalisation adjustment fund .
this time , unfortunately , styria ha also been hard hit .
volvo car is a very important employer in western sweden .
i abstained from the vote on further mobilisation of the globalisation adjustment fund .
another request concern a construction company in the netherlands .
this amending budget clearly reflects the contradiction in the european union 's budget .
this type of agreement is often far more unfavourable to developing country .
wto member must remain committed to actively fighting protectionism .
no , global free trade is not a solution to the current crisis .
on the contrary , it is one of it main cause .
that way , it is mutually beneficial to the partner involved .
that will give u a fair trading system of service to everyone .
that is the spirit of the doha development programme .
such a mandate must be adapted to the current state of the world .
at the same time , we must adopt sound principle of competitiveness .
we realise that another framework of compliance with international law is needed .
i fear that this is exactly the impression that this resolution is giving .
that is why , the institutional aspect aside , we voted against .
however , the state must not sink to the level of the terrorist .
i am proud that this decision wa taken unanimously .
natalia estemirova should have been among u today , a should anna politkovskaya .
their killer have yet to be brought to justice .
we in the european parliament will never forget the past .
i would ask you to rise to honour the memory of these people .
( the house rose and observed a moment 's silence )
we let slip a few year of confused and incomplete political freedom .
on the other hand , terror is also used when necessary .
how many russian security official are punished for these crime ?
who ensured they were called to account and judged ?
what can we expect here from european politician and from european public opinion ?
so what should europe do in relation to russia ?
the prize you are awarding today is awarded 'for freedom of thought ' .
this is now being repeated in chechnya , under ramzan kadyrov .
however paradoxical it may be , purely and solely freedom of thought .
freedom of thought is the basis of all other freedom .
( the house accorded the speaker a standing ovation )
( the sitting wa suspended at 12.30 and resumed at 15.00 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
new eu action plan for afghanistan and pakistan ( debate )
turning around the situation in afghanistan represents a major challenge .
we all need to do more and to do better .
i believe that this action plan is a good tool .
there is no need to discus the election process further .
i believe that is also the opinion of the afghan people .
we hope that a new government will soon be in place .
five year with no change is not an option .
this military commitment must be matched by civil initiative .
security , good governance and development must go hand in hand .
we will need to do more and to do better .
agriculture and rural development are a further priority area for europe .
we are also prepared to support an afghan-led rehabilitation process for former militant .
support for the electoral system will naturally also be high on the agenda .
i would also like to say a few word about pakistan .
pakistan is a country that ha been through major change in recent year .
however , democracy is currently in a fragile and unstable state .
scarcely a week pass without medium report of further suicide attack .
the eu want to help support pakistan 's civil institution .
the pakistani government know that this must be done .
it must indicate to u the area in which it wish to cooperate .
this will also be brought about through economic development and trade .
the government 's effort against the pakistani taliban represent a positive move .
we need to take further step in our operation in afghanistan and pakistan .
strategy and document will not in themselves improve the situation .
vice-president designate of the commission . - let me start with afghanistan .
we are at an important point in our relation here .
europe ha much to offer from our own experience .
a for pakistan : 'yes ' to the action plan .
this is where the european union 's place and role lie .
i believe parliament must contribute to making this strategy stronger and more coherent .
i am putting together all the necessary bit of information .
we never supported it and time ha proved u right .
in afghanistan , history ha demonstrated that there can be no military solution .
yet the uk pay gbp 45 million a day into this corrupt institution .
the council would like to counter the production of opium poppy .
that can only mean that military action ha a legitimate part to play .
it is a murderous , pointless war that simply can not be won .
in your statement , you referred to two key word .
you also said that our response must be coherent .
i have two comment in this respect , mr ashton .
my first question is simple : why did we go to afghanistan ?
this is a major , everyday problem that we must bear in mind .
the third point is that the security situation ha significantly deteriorated .
in 2004 , it wa possible to walk around kabul .
our withdrawal must therefore come with some condition attached .
thirdly , a social level must be accepted that is not perfect .
it would not cost much and it would be very efficient .
i essentially support what ha been said about both country .
therefore , what structure do we actually want to set up ?
the same is envisaged by the u in the security sector .
i think not - and then we have a problem .
another very important moment for afghanistan will be the london conference in january .
a i have said , many important factor are at stake .
we are now in 2009 and exactly that ha happened .
most importantly , we need to keep an eye on internal development .
the second is an improvement in the condition under which people live .
minister malmström , quite rightly , raised the issue of regional cooperation .
we should bury the idea of a military victory once and for all .
this is a mission that we must carry out .
i would have liked more to have been said about this .
increased development assistance in afghanistan basically mean an investment in our own security .
it ha emerged that there is very strong leadership in place .
we have increased the workforce by 280 international personnel .
we must now focus on implementing all these good idea .
we have an enormous amount of work ahead of u .
that is why we need the eu to be committed .
it is very important to tackle it from all of the different perspective .
the last one i have here is dated july 2009 .
but i do agree that we need to be more efficient .
the people can not choose the 'better imperialist ' .
the problem affecting afghanistan and pakistan are not confined only to these country .
the mission launched in afghanistan must be brought to a conclusion .
the european union 's action in afghanistan and pakistan must be coordinated .
it is imperative we take action to improve the situation in afghanistan .
this will enable stabilisation of the social system in afghanistan .
the next item is the council and commission statement on belarus .
when we discussed this , we focused on two important aspect .
the global financial crisis is actually providing opportunity for influence .
in the energy sector , the low gas price are just a memory .
can we then exploit this situation to encourage belarus to change track ?
we must help to strengthen the cautious movement towards greater openness .
we have to consider how effective our sanction policy is .
at the moment , discussion are focusing on two possible alternative .
it could become a crucial factor in opening up and influencing belarusian culture .
it is entirely in line with the aim of the eastern partnership .
belarus is in an important location on the eastern border of the eu .
the principle of the rule of law must be respected .
dialogue is essential if our demand are to bring result .
we launched a dialogue on human right issue in june 2009 .
there must be an end to political prisoner and politically motivated prosecution .
reform of the electoral legislation in line with osce/odihr recommendation is sorely needed .
in conclusion , therefore , our offer to belarus is clear .
i think that we should also refer to that .
it resulted in repression and there wa jostling , brawling and the like .
the duchy defended the value of western civilisation in it north-eastern periphery .
however , we must move from word and gesture to something concrete .
the eu must also open up to belarusian good and service .
i therefore find this preventive censure of the italian prime minister very annoying .
we must , however , be principled in our demand .
such bureaucratic and financial wall must be torn down a soon a possible .
meanwhile 28 % of resident would like better relation with russia .
it is not the west that need reform , but the belarusian themselves .
they , too , are waiting for this signal .
we will be much obliged to you for this .
what conclusion should the european institution draw from this ?
minsk must realise that our policy ha one objective - democracy in belarus .
for taking part in a forum on the eastern partnership in brussels .
we have had lot of contact with civil society during this year .
it certainly merit being explored to see if we can move forward .
it show that we are truly committed , we stuck out our hand .
i wish to thank you for a constructive and forward-looking debate .
there are five measure we expect belarus to take resolutely and irreversibly .
fourthly , improve through regulatory and legislative measure working condition for ngo .
fifthly , abolish or declare a moratorium on the death penalty .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday , 17 december 2009 ) .
violence in the democratic republic of congo ( debate )
i am sure that the commission will say more about this later .
both military and civil esdp instrument have been used .
diplomatic relation between the democratic republic of congo and rwanda have been restored .
there are high level of murder , act of violence and sexual attack .
the illegal exploitation of natural resource is a further major problem .
every effort ha been made to prevent the worst .
the condition in which monuc may operate must also be clear and unambiguous .
this is not about calling for monuc to withdraw or disengage .
this is why a firmer stance is needed against all form of trafficking .
in order to achieve this task , certain element are crucial .
the second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance .
the problem is that thing can not be done in isolation .
the scale of the challenge implies the need for long-term policy .
however , congo doe not have to be a heart of darkness .
however , our optimism ha turned out to be premature .
let me just deal with the reality of this .
another element concern the act of violence by the fardc .
if they were quartered in barrack , thing would no doubt be different .
lastly , i believe that we must revisit the amani programme .
that would have been a possibility a little le than a year ago .
nevertheless , i believe that european union action is crucial .
a always , the question arises of whose security is being defended .
this change wa suspended when the war escalated once again .
we must stand a pillar against impunity rather than agent of it .
dialogue and engagement are the only road toward such a solution .
the humanitarian crisis is deepening with every day that pass .
everything must be done to ensure the protection of the civilian population .
a rapid response by the european union is therefore crucial .
how do you intend to act more effectively and more promptly ?
these are both sign of improvement in the situation in eastern congo .
we simply have to go in and save those people .
commissioner de gucht gave a long account of the eu 's operation .
the perpetrator must not be allowed to go free .
of course , this is only a small contribution .
in such a large country , it is modest .
i am not going to revert back to my initial statement .
this would be the worst thing one could imagine .
another very relevant paragraph is paragraph g regarding the coordinated operation .
lastly , there is a lot of criticism also of international criminal justice .
people are questioning whether this is compatible with politics .
in the congo , you see one of the answer .
there is no such thing a a free lunch .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 december 2009 .
the council also stressed that the reform agenda must be continued .
however , further effort are needed to increase understanding of international standard .
several arrest were made , after which there were no more incident .
the atmosphere within the coordination body for southern serbia ha since improved .
there are also positive development with regard to the sensitive issue of education .
( de ) mr malmström , thank you for your excellent reply .
i would ask the council to continue to address this explosive situation .
we are aware of the improvement , and the situation is fragile .
the present crisis is having a very severe impact on million of people .
employment policy is primarily the responsibility of the member state .
have you any suggestion at all for strengthening that mechanism ?
that will be decided by the spanish presidency later next spring .
all that will possibly fit into the new strategy .
one very important aspect of the strategy is the governance method .
do you see any public job that could be given to the unemployed ?
subject : negotiation for turkey to take part in joint frontex operation
what demand is turkey making a a condition for it participation ?
it ha also asked the turkish authority to refrain from different provocative action .
the frontex board ha been mandated to start those negotiation .
can the council give an update on the negotiation nearing conclusion in copenhagen ?
but reaching an agreement requires convergence on the following essential building block .
head of state or government are now approaching copenhagen .
so hopefully , an ambitious deal can be struck .
how doe the council intend to reach a compromise between such disparate figure ?
it is not an offer or a bid from the eu .
some have already allocated part of their development budget .
i can not anticipate the result of the negotiation , however .
( hu ) thank you very much , minister , for your answer .
there are 50 million people with disability living in the european union .
access to service ha been postponed for 10 year .
the council discussion are taking a lot of time .
we had lot of working group within the council .
disabled people constitute one of the most vulnerable group in society .
i believe that this decision will also include access to education for all .
this is a great step , but it is only one step .
there are no adjustment for person with movement disability .
also , a significant number of disabled people are simply unemployed .
we will work on the issue until the end of our presidency .
but , unfortunately , we do not have the unanimity yet .
( de ) we must prevent discrimination , which is a social problem .
it is up to all of u to prevent discrimination of any kind .
we need to have the overall directive first and then work from there .
i think we need to work on the overall directive first .
a the author is not present , question 11 lapse .
subject : appalling murder of poor peruvian farmer for profit
otherwise , we shall see a repeat of the same situation .
when doe the council intend to take action in these matter ?
subject : persecution of buddhist monk and nun in vietnam
i hope that you will continue to monitor development in a pragmatic way .
subject : iceland 's application to join the european union
i want to thank the president-in-office for her response .
that is an indication of the icelandic government 's commitment .
a the author is not present , question 16 lapse .
the directive on landfill is particularly difficult to implement .
i think everyone in this house support the effort .
subject : success by the swedish council presidency in matter of transparency
that make 21 public debate held over four month .
furthermore , one public deliberation wa held on the initiative of the presidency .
moreover , the new parliament ha not had a many item a usual .
it will make the european union more effective and democratic .
i am thinking in particular of the council working group .
president-in-office of the council . - it is indeed a very important question .
it is also how we implement it and it is about attitude .
thank you very much , and thank you to your team .
it is nevertheless very good that he is here .
this question of mutual recognition of professional qualification is not just a one-off .
before responding to the individual question , let me start with an overview .
these profession have often even been regulated in federal or regional law .
this ha brought about enhancement in day-to-day administrative cooperation between member state .
our intention is certainly to respect the timetable set in the directive .
this is a genuine problem for the citizen of europe .
it is important for u to acknowledge that there will inevitably be problem .
it is simply outrageous and we find it totally unacceptable .
there are organisation which are attempting to do this .
we must look more closely at the reason behind this .
the different culture and legal system certainly also play a role .
what effect doe european legislation have on these differing legal system ?
that is another issue that we will have to address .
i believe it is very important that we look at this issue again .
however , i also have question for the commission .
i have read them and they are certainly helpful .
nevertheless , it would have been useful to have them some time ago .
the service directive should be implemented at the end of the year .
the directive introduces harmonisation of training requirement for nurse .
however , this is obviously not the only problem area .
the most obvious example is that of the medical profession .
similarly , certain specialism do not exist in every member state .
these two directive complement each other in certain respect .
my question to the commission is connected to health care professional .
thank you , mr president , for raising this issue for the committee .
mr president , let u get straight to the point here .
for the individual involved , it is restricting the free movement of labour .
national supervision in this regard seems to be inadequate .
i should like to ask the commissioner three question .
it is because of a lack of experience and the early morning hour .
we believe that it is up to the member state to deliver now .
the free movement of professional ha already been adopted in directive 2005/36/ec .
however , problem are occurring repeatedly , particularly in region near national border .
these enquiry often relate to the recognition of professional qualification .
at the same time , many area are short-staffed .
we need a transparent , simple and clear recognition procedure .
today , we are well prepared to face the future .
the european regional policy ha already passed the subsidiarity test .
we policy maker have raised the stake by promising to deliver .
development policy with clear target and tool is needed .
it is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from .
cohesion policy is a good example of multi-level governance .
of course , the european parliament want a financial mid-term review .
i should like to finish off with a question .
for u , there is no question that we also need to change .
there must be no thought of separating the esf from the cohesion policy .
it is a symbol of solidarity and of overcoming national egoism .
we need reform , but it must result in genuine change .
it must bring about sustainable development in the region .
we already have the leader method for the development of rural area .
will we manage to improve quality of life and make saving ?
today , we must think twice before deciding where to direct european fund .
we call on the worker to reject this policy .
but wale can not afford to pay if nothing is paid back out .
many town and rural region would lack decisive incentive for structural change .
medium-sized company would be prevented from taking part successfully in international network .
this doe not mean that we are closed to the idea of reform .
in future , we should also enable job to be subsidised .
the european commission must , in our view , integrate the following principle .
the choice is between the market and social policy .
the structural fund must be strengthened and not weakened .
the sudden removal of subsidy after 2013 would be devastating for these region .
i would like to say one last word about the border region .
i am very concerned that the commission will fail u in this respect .
it is vitally important for parliament to have clearly identified local contact point .
this debate on the cohesion policy after 2013 is therefore much needed .
i should like to make three brief remark in this respect .
investment related to environment protection are also extremely important .
the cohesion policy should also include rural area to a greater degree .
last but not least , i want to talk about rural development .
suitable resource need to be allocated to rural development policy .
the individual member state must also take more responsibility in this area .
we do not want structural funding to be renationalised .
so , mr gollnisch , you have finally arrived .
i think that two main point have come out of these speech .
the most optimistic estimate put this time at around 2010 .
this is why we need a strong and adequately funded cohesion policy .
we must not put at risk what ha already been achieved .
the present international economic crisis ha bared it teeth .
it ha caused numerous inequality and pressure , especially among vulnerable group .
however , the present global economic crisis is also a challenge .
what instrument will be developed by the european commission for local authority ?
in my opinion , we go to two extreme here .
cohesion policy must be the same for both urban and rural area .
ensuring equal opportunity for development is an important task .
90 % of the building which will exist in 2020 already exist now .
i am referring here , above all , to young people .
this is the only way we can face the future with certainty .
coordination with the eu 's other policy must also be improved .
the cohesion policy after 2013 must continue to make this vision a reality .
one good approach is to make territorial cohesion the main objective .
in this context , interregional cooperation play an important role .
in recent decade , the interregional approach ha had some significant success .
however , there is still work to be done in the future .
a new version of the document is currently being written .
good regional policy can be achieved only with close cooperation from the region .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.05 and resumed at 11.30 )
( the house accorded mr stensballe a standing ovation )
firstly , i have a request for the entire house .
we have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon .
prominent government representative from the eu are working to achieve a positive solution .
mr schulz , i am not certain we can discus this point again .
it is difficult , now , to discus this point again .
( fr ) mr president , i support mr schulz 's proposal .
i ask that we first be allowed to find a political solution .
( pt ) i would just like to make a brief point .
now i will ask for someone to speak against the motion .
we were also able to overcome difference of opinion in the same meeting .
the house wa going to express it view today .
mr schulz made a proposal to the house this morning .
i am dealing with this case with great care .
we can not continue discussion on this matter indefinitely .
( fr ) no , that is not true .
lady and gentleman , we have heard all the comment .
you have heard everything and you have a full picture .
lady and gentleman , mr schulz , please put on your headphone .
how is it possible that the voting list is so short ?
it is due to the excellent cooperation of the group .
it is not possible to combine it all into one block .
i would like to finish with a personal reflection .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
at the moment , there is a delegation from serbia in the gallery .
we would like to extend a very warm welcome to the delegation .
please stand up , so that everyone can see you .
we have some very important work before u next year .
madam president , there is a mistake in the epp voting list .
whenever other people are being opposed , the authority is in place .
for this reason , we should not give in to them .
however , the second argument is worthy of serious discussion .
are we responsible for the convention on human right ?
violence in the democratic republic of congo ( vote )
could you please have your discussion outside of the chamber ?
in writing . - i voted in favour of this very reluctantly .
the energy strand of the european economic recovery plan contains some striking proposal .
that is why , on this chapter , i decided to abstain .
i supported the european union budget for the financial year 2010 .
so the debate on expenditure in 2010 will not end today .
i am voting in favour of the report on the 2010 eu budget .
no , that europe is definitely not the solution but the problem .
voting for this budget would go against the european general interest .
for this reason , i reject the draft budget .
thorough reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore necessary .
it also includes eu support for milk and fruit in school .
negotiation , by definition , demand a discrete environment .
such improvement must safeguard the right of all citizen of the union .
it is therefore essential to find a balance on this subject .
transparency is important and it importance is growing in the age of globalisation .
any measure aimed at improving condition in these country are very important .
there can be no consent , on our part , to other measure .
belarusian , and also the whole of europe , expect this of u .
all intervention by neighbouring and other country must therefore cease .
the united nation security council should review the mandate of monuc .
( pt ) mr president , i have a point of order .
i wish to enquire about the resolution agreed between the parliamentary group .
i regret that i can now only permit point of order .
this is what happened this morning , in a highly unusual manner .
i would therefore like to know if this process wa followed .
if it wa not , the resolution should be debated immediately .
consequently , we also believe the rule of procedure have been applied incorrectly .
we therefore call on the president to resolve the matter .
this is in accordance with the rule of procedure .
i object to the fact that wa not actually put to the house .
i have explained my understanding of the rule of procedure to you .
therefore , the procedure is in accordance with the rule of procedure .
i am not able to acknowledge other new point of order .
( e ) mr president , this is indeed a point of order .
( the minute of the previous sitting were approved )
homosexuality is illegal in uganda a it is in many african country .
why should uganda 's parliamentarian choose to throw all that goodwill away ?
i would like to tell you a brief story .
this law would also be a major obstacle to the fight against aid .
and by the european commissioner for development , mr de gucht .
mr striffler , you had a further 12 second .
a ban on discrimination because of sexual orientation is nothing new .
however , due to the reason we already know , i can not .
today , we need to add the new text to those already adopted .
i strongly reject any move to introduce the use of the death penalty .
i believe this is indicative of unanimity across the chamber .
i support mr cashman , the author and group spokesperson .
taking the bill forward would be tantamount to returning uganda to colonial condition .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the journalist were officially charged with spreading hooliganism and terrorism .
it is significantly more difficult to force institutional change .
the representative of memorial mentioned this several time in this house .
the european parliament therefore ha to take a stand .
this applies fully to the eu 's relation with azerbaijan too .
it is certainly an essential partner in effort to ensure european energy security .
however , the situation of medium freedom is only getting worse .
freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy .
there is growing violence against journalist and civil society activist .
we also spoke about the southern caucasus , again including azerbaijan .
freedom of expression is a very important feature of a democratic society .
the human right prize ha already been mentioned today .
today it wa a different subject , the western sahara .
now it is slowly beginning to become more democratic .
( ro ) i , too , support what mr posselt said earlier .
a partnership and cooperation agreement ha been in place for 10 year .
we have just started the preparatory work for the 2009 report .
we provide targeted support under the comprehensive institution-building programme .
this will constitute an important and additional forum for communicating our message .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .

team sent by individual eu country are also working there .

mr president , we have had some very heated debate .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
mr president , you referred to the death penalty earlier on .
this decision ha provoked reaction of disapproval from the british and dutch government .
some people question whether our airport security measure are too tight .
one of the strategy 's key point is investment in education and research .
no economy in the world can develop without having an educated society .
there may be a momentary lapse of concentration , a human error .
( fr ) i am sorry , mr president .
40 % of our natural heritage is under threat .
the party for freedom warns of the consequence of islamification .
islam ha no love for western freedom and democracy .
moreover , the majority of the prisoner have reported that they were tortured .
our objective must be to prevent such situation in the european union .
this area is one of the poorest in the european union .
in the case of bulgaria and romania , it is 2014 .
romania is also waging a political campaign for the oppression of hungarian minority .
in order to achieve this , we need a budget .
myth about the treaty are still circulating in public opinion .
nowhere in the european union must this opportunity be squandered .
they were going to launch terrorist attack in spain using explosive .
this is also what it mean to be part of europe .
i refer to the continuing upheaval of the financial market .
i hereby demand that olaf mount the appropriate investigation .
generally , the ratio in these group of expert is 80 to 20 .
yes , they are nearer to the region than the european union .
we see , for example , the belgian air force in the vicinity .
mr president , thank you very much for your indulgence .
lady and gentleman , the hearing are about to start .
i have given the floor to 32 speaker today .
i did not give the floor to those who spoke a month ago .
i would ask you , please , to check the list .
member who spoke a month ago were not considered .
in addition , those who spoke two month ago had a smaller chance .
you can come to my office and we will check it together .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the loss are devastating and the damage is enormous .
in term of financial assistance , the council reached the following conclusion .
in total , this is a big response in a short time .
assistance will be targeted , too , to the dominican republic .
the foreign affair council will meet again next monday .
we will follow up on haiti and consider further action .
haiti is one of the poorest country in the world .
also , the international community ha been hard hit .
in other word , this is not only about saving human life .
we have , in fact , to save the country a a whole .
let me just very briefly focus on four main challenge .
first , we have , of course , to address humanitarian need .
that will also be addressed within the framework of the eu institution .
lastly , we have to organise the coordination of international relief effort .
that is always very difficult in these kind of circumstance .
then we will have to see where we stand .
now one is hearing figure in the region of usd 10 billion .
the president and major ngo are on the spot .
that is all i have to say at the moment .
the public ha responded magnificently to the challenge of helping haiti .
there is no point impoverishing this country for another 100 year .
it is clear that the country need massive international support immediately .
until now , the international community ha been incapable of changing anything there .
in the 1970s , haiti wa almost self-sufficient where food wa concerned .
it used to produce 90 % of it agricultural need .
this must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production .
urgent humanitarian aid is necessary , but it alone is not enough .
there is no question that there will be fund coming .
we say , oh , the infrastructure is destroyed .
we need to be able to supply very rapidly an emergency infrastructure .
we need to think afresh a to how to save life immediately afterwards .
we salute all those men and woman who are involved in this .
the european union ha decided to release some initial fund .
it is essential to understand what is needed , by whom and when .
mr president , the horror of haiti is shocking .
all of u here are well paid and can afford to give .
however , with their tax , our constituent can not afford your generosity .
that is not compassion : that is stinking hypocrisy .
( fr ) mr president , is haiti condemned to misfortune ?
the european union must participate in this twin emergency and reconstruction effort .
finally , the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge .
we are perhaps at year zero of a new era for haiti .
this compassion is certainly spontaneous and sincere , but it is short-lived .
it is their development that we are talking about .
we can help them in a spirit of partnership .
yes to partnership , no to paternalism and neo-colonialism !
in addition , we should think about what could be done better .
more importantly , what can be changed in future ?
( fr ) mr president , mr ashton , that is enough !
i do not say this lightly ; the commission 's inaction is criminal .
mr ashton , why is europe doomed to repeat it mistake ?
if you need support , we are there to help you .
yet we are a force in the world due to our social model .
fifty thousand people dead , thousand still missing and three million homeless .
we have been left in the slipstream of the united state .
the world leader at that stage promised eur 600 million .
in my opinion , such talk is neither fair nor appropriate .
here i refer , in particular , to health and education policy .
we are the biggest donor , and yet we do not exist .
mr barnier 's report ha been on the table since 2006 .
this is too important to score cheap political point .
everything that can be done to improve the situation should be done .
for the long term , honourable member are absolutely right .
when the camera have gone , we need to be there .
let me finish on the reality of the situation .
the capacity of the haitian government are not functioning .
the vote will take place during the february part-session .
the recent statement by mr van rompuy are along the right line .
he advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force .
lady and gentleman , the report reaching u from haiti are shocking .
it is one of the most horrifying catastrophe we have heard of .
it is important that this house show solidarity to those people .
that , of course , is a matter for the iranian .
we issue public statement and use other diplomatic mean .
we need a serious engagement in meaningful talk from tehran 's side .
the widest possible unity is key if we are to achieve our objective .
a european parliament delegation wa even banned from entering .
their report were heavily relied upon by international journalist .
are you willing to call an emergency talk in europe on iran ?
i believe we need to support citizen , civil society and journalist .
the protest are many and they are still going on .
from the outside , what we can do is limited .
the crucial change must come from within the country itself .
despite the rebuff , we need to seek political dialogue .
isolating iran would help neither it people nor it neighbour in the region .
the question of a nuclear weapon is extremely important .
these value must not be treated a of le significance .
the european union must make this one of it objective .
on the contrary , iran 's long history show u this .
i would like you to voice your thought on this matter to u .
let u use it to help reach an agreement .
the clamp-down by the government ha not subdued the voice of democratic dissent .
i think that we should discus all this further and achieve our aim .
what funding doe the commission provide to human right ngo working in iran ?
iran 's current regime is the biggest threat to world peace .
in a way , these event recall moment from 60 year ago .
consequently , the prospect of additional sanction seems inevitable , or even desirable .
the question is : how to deal with it ?
i have one very concrete question to you , baroness ashton .
mr president , i want to agree with tunne kelam and mr alvaro .
the day of dialogue and engagement with iran ha long since passed .
i would urge you to continue with the dialogue .
the region will not be able to withstand another war .
continue with the dialogue and i think that we shall get somewhere .
what is the european union 's view about this case ?
curiously , there wa no mention of it today .
why is the eu not dealing with that too ?
even today , there are dozen of political prisoner in jail in hungary .
thank you very much , and i look forward to the answer .
however , we are far from seeing that in iran .
europe must be the main witness to what is the rule of law .
it is very important that it ha not yet officially been cancelled .
i think it would be important to consider whether we should pursue that .
a i have said , the e3+3 is already considering these option .
baroness ashton , you were talking about the iran delegation .
in fact , it wa cancelled by the iranian authority .
the vote will take place during the february i part-session in strasbourg .
( the sitting wa suspended at 17.30 and resumed at 17.35 )
yemen ha substantial population growth and an increasingly discontented young population .
an inclusive internal political consensus on the way forward remains elusive .
the council adopted extensive conclusion on yemen in october .
we are now seeking to rally all our key player around the strategy .
a key focus of the meeting will be security .
the establishment of al-qaeda in yemen is a symptom of deeper problem .
the linkage between economic , political , social and security challenge are crucial .
the international community should lend sustained support to this dialogue .
you have talked about coordination with the united state .
so the question is : what , precisely , to do .
i think that that would be , from my perspective , something worthwhile .
we must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebel .
i repeat : the local authority , and not just the government .
it seems that the eu is now faced with a dilemma .
it is international engagement which now must take place .
if not , what conclusion doe she expect to draw ?
terrorist group are adept at exploiting the possibility provided by failed state .
at the moment , the uk is disproportionately providing assistance .
for year , they have frequently resorted to military force .
u troop are already being deployed there a adviser .
what should the west in fact be doing to prevent the threat ?
we european must therefore do everything we can to finally stabilise the country .
we must do everything in our power to fight international terrorism .
peace requires democratic structure that uphold the right of minority .
that is our european path , and it may differ from other path .
there are over 130 000 refugee from somalia in yemen .
maybe you can also help to get them freed .
news about the recent intensification of the activity of terrorist group is worrying .
the weapon and the instructor were destined for the houthi rebel .
now it wish to foment a proxy regional conflict with sunni-dominated saudi arabia .
support for yemen can not be divorced from the issue of security .
terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflict .
the european union should make effort to prevent escalation of the present crisis .
( sv ) yemen is not just a safe haven for al-qaeda .
that ha been made clear in the debate here .
the yemeni government ha repeatedly accused iran of supporting the shi'ite rebellion movement .
which programme would have priority here , for you , high representative ?
those prisoner were released , and are now organising attack again .
mr brantner , you raised particularly the gulf cooperation council .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in february .
provincial election last year went fairly smoothly all over iraq .
clearly , iraq must deal with the many challenge .
with our international partner , we will be following them very closely .
honourable member , iraq is on a positive trajectory .
a mature democracy also recognises the right of minority .
human right watch continues to report that non-muslim minority are being persecuted .
since 2004 , there have been attack on 65 church .
local militia continue to drive christian from their home .
the european union can not continue to stand idly by in this situation .
you say that we act in accordance with iraq 's priority .
that is perhaps not iraq 's top priority , but it is ours .
i did not hear the high representative mention the position of iran .
so is the memorandum also being discussed with the kurdish autonomous government ?
there need to be an integrated approach concerning the state neighbouring iraq .
please would you give a clue about that integrated approach ?
there is no legislation to protect minority in iraq .
he ha been banned from participating in the forthcoming election .
baroness ashton , i am sorry but i do not share your optimism .
this is the factor that is distorting the true situation in iraq .
the violence against them just go on increasing , despite their shrinking number .
before christmas , there were three deadly attack in mosul .
i would appreciate hearing your position on this , high representative .
the news about the application of the death penalty is also disheartening .
the strengthening of the eulex is also important in this regard .
one and a half million iraqi still live in neighbouring country .
much evidence point to the fact that iran is responsible for sponsoring terrorism .
religious fanaticism there is recruiting numerous reserve of fighter .
election take place in a deplorable and unfair manner .
the experience of iraqi kurdistan could be a useful reference point .
this is a reality of which we can be certain .
i think we could help iraq greatly in this area .
the review of candidate wa always part of the pre-electoral process .
we fully support iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state .
i feel very strongly that iraq ha to solve these issue for itself .
just a little bit more about energy cooperation too .
honourable member raised the question of the withdrawal of force .
that , again , is of significance and importance .
going back to where we began , i am optimistic about iraq .
we must ensure that we work consistently towards that end .
the cloak of so-called democratic election can by no mean cover that up .
this aid need to be supplied for a sufficiently long period of time .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00 )
second revision of the acp-eu partnership agreement ( cotonou agreement ) ( debate )
we must therefore carry out a radical overhaul of all our policy .
i am sorry to tell you that this is not the case today .
how can we eradicate poverty without making food sovereignty a priority ?
agriculture must be at the heart of the european union 's development policy .
another matter that is close to my heart is that of tax haven .
stopping this haemorrhage is a question of consistency and credibility .
let me now share with you some observation on the report .
the commission is committed to strengthening the parliamentary dimension in the cotonou agreement .
therefore , our intention is not to weaken the jpa .
likewise , we will address food security in the regional dimension .
good governance is a fundamental principle of the cotonou agreement .
we are also seeking to address these aspect in the ongoing revision exercise .
how do we create wealth in the acp country ?
mr joly ha very interestingly identified that there is a flight of capital .
she say that eight time what we put into those country go out .
why is that capital not employed in those country ?
mr president , my group support mr joly 's report .
the first revision of the cotonou agreement took up the political dimension .
here , we should take the side of food self-determination more decisively .
i endorse the desire expressed in the report to strengthen national parliament .
we should therefore concentrate on legal immigration and mobility .
in this regard , the clear identification of priority is extremely important .
regular dialogue with local population will enable a realistic adjustment to be made .
mr president , brevity is the source of wit .
at the same time , global warming may present an opportunity .
this situation call for international solidarity , action and attention .
the 2005 revision took a few step in the right direction .
this is an apocalyptic scenario which the international community must start to understand .
this will allow u to utilise our strategy to the best effect .
this must be rectified during the new revision of the cotonou agreement .
i urge the commission and the spanish presidency to rectify this .
development aid must not be conditional on the implementation of economic partnership agreement .
let u turn charity case into producer with a sense of self-worth .
several speaker also spoke of the nature of the economic partnership agreement .
with respect to article 13 , both side want to update migration .
the aspect put forward by the report are duly taken into account .
mr cashman made a remark with respect to discrimination .
un language is le specific but would also cover sexual orientation .
let u therefore do what we can and put nothing off until tomorrow .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 20 january 2010 ) .
or , thirdly , doe it also include abortion ?
we have supported the latter because , then , more criminal get caught .
one of those case is my own constituent andrew symeou .
puzzlingly , british court seem shy of invoking this clause to block surrender .
the swedish presidency did indeed make important progress in this field .
that wa with regard to the council during the swedish presidency .
you know how much i value these procedural guarantee .
this approach will allow u to achieve our intended objective .
this is essential if we want to create a truly european judicial area .
we would like these procedural right to be considered a a package .
the commission made it proposal in 2002 and undertook to see speedy action .
it ha substantially cut the time needed for surrender .
two of my constituent are currently in detention in hungary awaiting trial .
one ha lost his job and his family 's main source of income .
both are deprived of the company of loved one .
case like this give european judicial cooperation a bad name .
they pour shame on the inaction of government in council .
they are applying for asylum and lithuania is demanding their extradition .
the case is being heard next monday at the helsinki district court .
there is , in fact , no trial date .
they are separated and have no contact with each other .
they share a small cell with three other prisoner .
they are confined to their cell 23 hour a day .
they are permitted three telephone call and one shower a week .
and they are imprisoned only because of the european arrest warrant .
extradition ha now been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality .
the political cynicism of the british liberal democrat is truly breathtaking .
the common procedure are about lowering european legal standard and not raising them .
i would like to make one final point about the european arrest warrant .
the european arrest warrant ha been brought up only to criticise it .
the commission is already working on the proposal on a letter of right .
the estimate of one year to enforce each measure is only indicative .
in 1850 , slavery wa officially banned throughout europe .
popular opinion is also more or le of this view .
in addition , i would like to emphasise the need for policy coordination .
i believe that human trafficking is the greatest scourge of humanity .
we absolutely agree that this is the right approach .
i believe that your idea on the subject of demand is also important .
it is a very important idea that must also be seen through .
sentence must be severe and the harmonisation of maximum penalty must continue .
i now come to the help and protection provided to victim .
we must provide the european union with reliable and comparable statistic .
it is therefore time to react , and to react forcefully .
the recent stockholm programme also talked about the trafficking and exploitation of minor .
mr barrot talked about the need for new legislation .
we hope we will see the commission proposal very soon .
their right and their future must be top priority .
it must give them right and a new future .
the main objective of human trafficking is sexual exploitation or enforced slave labour .
i am pleased that the spanish presidency intends to address this issue .
i have been pleased to hear a unanimous opinion expressed here .
now , let u take this a our starting point .
europe should have the courage to call a spade a spade .
unfortunately , number have been rising in recent year .
in fact , it is a definition of slavery .
national government , law-enforcement agency and border-control agency need to work together .
initiative must be robust , member state-driven and eu-supported .
our response to it must be massive and concentrated .
it is time that it wa consigned to the dark recess of history .
also missing is effective prevention and education focused on child and parent alike .
consequently , we have to come down hard on those behind it .
we must not send them back into the arm of the human trafficker .
very often , we do not want to see it .
they find it just too easy to re-traffic these child .
this campaign should alert parent to the risk that their child face .
unfortunately , parent are not mentioned anywhere in the draft resolution .
the victim do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
thirdly , the situation is not being monitored sufficiently .
it is obvious that this problem doe not affect only the european union .
we therefore need great political will to tackle the problem .
here tonight , this great political will ha been displayed , and how !
it is happening in europe and we must tackle it from europe .
i believe that mr roithová put it very succinctly in her speech .
once again , i would like to thank all the speaker .
the vote will take place at the february i part-session .
often , it is child who are in the greatest danger .
the eu must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market .
it is very important to make a distinction between the two .
victim protection cost money , and this life-saving money should be spent wisely .
what is clear is that the political will is not there .
it concern the 18 additional member of the european parliament .
presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency ( debate )
it is more than an honour , it is a great honour .
europe wa the dream of generation , of many generation of spaniard .
this is what we want to do during the next six month .
regarding the economic crisis , i would like to say the following .
we know what the european union 's strength and weakness are .
our strength are clear : we represent almost a third of global gdp .
we want to take step to establish a digital market .
the third area is the economy or sustainable industry .
the matter of neighbourhood relation must be a priority .
i hope that the vote will take place very soon .
the commission could mobilise a further eur 200 million in longer-term aid .
everything point in the direction of determined and united european action .
only with a united europe can we shape globalisation .
but we have to look at the situation of our economy .
we all know that the european economy is at a delicate moment .
at the same time , we must learn from the crisis .
however , i am confident in the capacity of europe .
europe 2020 must offer both a mid-term vision and short-term action .
but , of course , this doe not exhaust our agenda .
the challenge of the coming week and month are manifold .
today , we are forecasting our role for many year to come .
mr rodríguez zapatero , you know what economic difficulty are .
the council and parliament must now work in close cooperation and a equal .
the summit do not solve the problem , they delineate them .
it wa not that it would not have been possible to implement it .
we will not make it into the 21st century on rosinante .
what europe need is to adopt some aspect of the spanish model .
that is destroying people 's trust in the economic system .
so , i wish you good luck , mr zapatero .
i believe you also have , in fact , two priority .
first of all , there is the post-lisbon eu 2020 strategy .
this is , therefore , already a major advance .
however we , in this house , have to be serious .
it is a if the union ha become the oecd .
that is the reality : publishing one document after another , after another .
thing must change ; we need stick , we need carrot .
we must say it , we must recognise it .
the strategy wa bad , because the result is bad .
i myself suggest that we adopt a strategy based on three component .
there wa not enough room around the table though !
let u do like the wto then ; it work for the wto .
moreover , we must , i believe , be realistic .
we need a trilateral agreement between the united state , europe and china .
this mean that we must be at the table .
it is with the united state that we must find common ground .
mr president , take up michel barnier 's proposal .
i would like to continue with another theme , which mr verhofstadt discussed .
one of the pillar of the fight against energy dependence is energy saving .
we can do it , if we want to .
now to the second issue ; you spoke about electric car .
there is a major project that could be developed in europe .
curriculum have been created that student are unable to follow .
i would like to end on your european social pact .
a european social pact and a social and environmental pact .
a for the instrument , we shall have to develop them together .
it stumbled in it first few day in office .
it illegitimate , brutal and dangerous government must be dealt with firmly .
the spanish presidency take office with a full agenda .
our group will judge it proposal and initiative on their merit .
if it doe that , then it will have our support .
from this perspective , unfortunately , there is nothing new in your programme .
on this specific point , there is no innovation .
finally , mr zapatero , the summit with morocco .
on behalf of the efd group . - mr president , thank you .
is this situation i describe going to bring peace to europe ?
those value are freedom , the rule of reason , laicism and solidarity .
i would also place more emphasis on defending human right in the world .
i will talk about the most important matter , starting with mr daul .
i am a strong supporter of the stability pact .
i am a strong supporter of fiscal balance throughout the cycle .
deficit and surplus are tool , depending on the economic cycle .
this is the will of the government , within it scope of competence .
mr verhofstadt , i am extremely grateful for your word .
with regard to coordination and the failure of lisbon , open coordination failed .
i respect your position on morocco , but i do not share it .
for me personally , it is something worthy of applause .
i have taken note of your suggestion , mr andreasen .
joining force doe not mean controlling , uniting doe not mean leading .
on the contrary , joining force is more democratic , uniting promotes cooperation .
i share your concern and your feeling on this subject .
a we are well aware , energy ha determined the course of history .
it ha determined how certain power have dominated other country .
we will therefore maintain the summit with our neighbour , morocco .
we will , at all time , promote the defence of human right .
i would like to express my respect for all their position .
now , i believe that the answer lie in the treaty of lisbon .
here , too , the treaty of lisbon ha to be read .
there are those who think that economic policy is a purely national matter .
no , yes , of course , i have already done it .
i do not need to have your support to say it ...
include the region , build decision-making process with them .
that is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection .
the further large-scale immigration you are advocating can only lead to large-scale problem .
however , what do you really have to say ?
what is so good about this spanish model then ?
however , what can we do with something so non-committal ?
of course we are opposed to marital violence , who would not be ?
he resisted the opposition of the council to the stability and growth pact .
help him to secure the stability and growth pact .
help him to do this and you will have u on your side .
mr zapatero most definitely mentioned unemployment , including unemployment in his own country .
unemployment a a whole is something that worry u .
the crisis is global , but the solution are local .
you have wasted two year and are still not providing concrete solution .
come here with humility and learn , do not seek to lecture .
furthermore , this deficit ha not been used to build extensive communication infrastructure .
it wish to adopt a new strategy of growth and employment .
the spanish presidency say it wish to increase immigration .
at present , all this appears to me to be clearly contradictory .
do we want new immigrant who have no home or job ?
unless , of course , we are confusing haiti with tahiti .
unfortunately , such endeavour have always been undermined by national government .
there is a political sensitivity which is different in the two part .
i hope that the spanish presidency will be able to cope with this .
you are therefore creating the blueprint , so to speak .
iceland and icesave have been taking great risk for many year .
that is the only way of building the confidence required for accession .
what the citizen of the european union really need is job .
this is the only acceptable basis for renewing the lisbon strategy .
how to share responsibility between the member state and the union ?
whom do we want to benefit with the new strategy ?
how to harmonise the cohesion and the structural policy ?
the concept of the danube a a green corridor is related to this .
our other aim is to lend a hand to the european region .
we have to take advantage of the strength of these community .
that would be an important matter for the spanish presidency to address .
a far a the social pact is concerned , it sound very interesting .
there is too much wage dumping and too much crude exploitation .
i approach it not like the former speaker from an anti-european perspective .
it is a problem of european justice , access to civil justice .
you made many wonderful comment about european citizenship and fairness and honesty .
brussels ' remit doe not cover the retirement age , for example .
let u be decisive , but let u also respect subsidiarity .
secondly , this morning , you mentioned food security , prime minister .
the programme also includes the review of the ten-t action guideline .
the aim and stated aim are sound , but certain ambiguity remain .
specifically , there are no concrete measure to combat unemployment .
prime minister , you have spoken of six month of change .
presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency ( continuation of debate )
doe it mean perhaps preventing all citizen from publicly expressing their religion ?
you know that we agree with the programme you have put forward .
otherwise , we run the risk of becoming irrelevant .
we are waiting with great interest for decision and specific proposal .
i wanted to ask you about latin america , prime minister .
one example is the canary island and the people who live there .
last year , i wa there to take a course in spanish .
i would like to ask the commission to do so in time .
i wish to ask you , what are european interest ?
after drawing a lesson from the crisis , we need real economic revolution .
do you agree that the liberalised market is unable to self-regulate ?
do you agree that the liberal dogma should be reviewed ?
this will not occur in any other area or region of the world .
i refer to the work carried out by mr durão barroso .
i have been criticised for giving him my support .
thirdly , the financial system , tax haven and new regulation and supervision .
there wa a question concerning the area of foreign policy .
we know what the aim and the condition are .
to work with israel is to work for peace .
it would be a response of support and solidarity .
thank you , mr zapatero , for your speech .
moldova is in need of financial and political support at the moment .
this should be a priority for both the current presidency and subsequent presidency .
the secretary general of the union for the mediterranean ha recently been appointed .
in this respect , i believe that support for smes is absolutely imperative .
but we are at one minute to midnight for such a solution .
creating condition for early palestinian election is a key to progress .
in a nutshell , guaranteeing eu citizen ' security .
everyone is aware of the interdependence and interconnectivity between our respective economy .
thank you , mr zapatero , for your inaugural speech .
however , it lacked a clear reference to the problem of huge deficit .
most important among them , i think , are three matter :
resolute and rapid action to slow down rising unemployment .
fortunately , the resolution wa passed by vote from the left .
spain is going to have to coordinate it work with belgium and hungary .
mr president , i would like to welcome the spanish presidency very warmly .
i must admit that i have specific expectation of this presidency .
this is something which should be a priority of each successive presidency .
continuation and acceleration of work on it introduction is an absolutely crucial matter .
the spanish presidency come at a strategically important time for europe .
defining the new comitology rule is a key element of the legislative process .
the eu 2020 strategy must find solution to meet these expectation .
i think our cooperation ha become even smoother and more productive .
we all have a responsibility to support him in that work .
second revision of the acp-eu partnership agreement ( cotonou agreement ) (
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
the week ha been given over to backroom manoeuvring .
we have come through this nonsense of the hearing .
you do not have to be a eurosceptic to find that objectionable .
the ombudsman must be an independent , non-partisan and impartial public servant .
in the vote to elect the ombudsman , i voted for pierre-yves monette .
he examines complaint made by eu citizen about impropriety in european institution .
we agree with the content of the proposal contained in the document .
a lot of attention should be given to migration problem .
those thing should be addressed clearly in the revised agreement .
elsewhere , the report fall short of what is needed .
this report undeniably contains some very valuable suggestion and often laudable intention .
neither ha happened , to the ultimate shame of the european commission .
the report emphasis this , and thus receives my support .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the debate on the council statement on swift .
this agreement ha been in place for the last few month .
it will be known to the european parliament on 25 january .
this is what will be produced on 25 january .
this is a procedure , a programme to combat terrorism .
we want to cooperate with our partner in the fight against terror .
i will simply take note of it now and then overlook it .
someone stuff some explosive into their underwear and fly over the atlantic .
that can not be what it is dependent on , though .
there are therefore two option , mr zapatero : yes or no .
no response to the condition laid down by parliament ha been received .
i would like to ask you one more thing .
swift ha been a valuable tool in achieving this .
on the contrary , they have resulted in unacceptable restriction of citizen right .
however , the council did not sanction this procedure , it legalised it !
i will check it out and let you know the situation in writing .
it is not a matter of gaining time , mr weber .
it did not happen that way for the reason i told you .
parliament will take part in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term agreement .
therefore , we have all the condition to make a good agreement .
this is a legislative chamber in which serious work is required !
i will not give the floor to anyone else on this matter .
outcome of the copenhagen summit on climate change ( debate )
the european union environment minister discussed these matter at length last weekend .
let u bring to bear our collective european experience .
firstly , we have to push for a proper response before 31 january .
i volunteered to substitute for stavros in this very important debate .
the contact with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful .
on the other hand , the accord ha serious weakness .
it contains no reference to mid-term or long-term mitigation target .
the same go for global economic governance and international security .
let u take copenhagen a an alarming warning of that scenario .
we must do better than that and we can do .
we must revise our strategy , but we must also retain our ambition .
a a fellow member said recently , europe wa absent .
after this disappointment , it is important to regain the initiative .
that only increase the risk of the mistake being repeated .
this strategy must be firm , dynamic and innovative .
it can only be internationally legitimate if negotiated via the united nation .
we also need a new form of climate diplomacy .
mr president , an ambitious , legally-binding treaty is needed urgently .
the lack of political will demonstrated in copenhagen can not be repeated .
lady and gentleman , of course , copenhagen wa disappointing .
many of our demand and the expectation of citizen were definitely not met .
i would like to add one thing to what ha already been said .
we want an international agreement for emission from aviation and maritime transport .
unfortunately , copenhagen brought absolutely no progress on this matter .
it wa not even mentioned in the copenhagen climate agreement .
it must continue and that is also what the citizen expect from u .
we should look for the positive thing that actually happened in copenhagen .
it wa the first council configuration under the spanish presidency .
the council of minister wa divided , with a complete lack of direction .
the truth is we do not know the way .
the commission ha finally put forward a draft decision .
it is a crucial test both for the commission and the presidency .
who will speak on europe 's behalf in mexico ?
therefore , the eu must now promise 30 % .
the copenhagen conference wa a good example of a bad method .
instead of being a decisive player , the eu wa a confused spectator .
important barrier to punish both country would be disastrous .
finally , we need serious research on the body of evidence .
some member of the ipcc now even predict global cooling .
we urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity .
it is the same in poland , korea and china .
we have seen professor jones from the university of east anglia - crook !
( hu ) minister , i have surprising news for you .
copenhagen is a clear message about the world we are living in .
of course , behind the global economy there is a small power elite .
we need to change the political and moral climate .
i still remember the debate we had here in this house before copenhagen .
everyone wa glowing with optimism , but it came to nothing .
the u and china together account for almost half .
however , in europe , we do not speak with one voice .
the last environment council showed very clearly how different the view are there .
however , china and the u are opting for a different route .
that is how the world should have reacted in copenhagen .
it would be crazy to raise our ambition in the current state .
we need a strategy and we need a 'post-copenhagen agenda ' .
the eu must speak with one voice in these negotiation .
under these circumstance , it is clearly easy to knock the un process .
reread parliament 's resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30 % .
this is a position we can not justify to our taxpayer .
we asked for too much and we have achieved nothing .
lady and gentleman , the global warming story is a waste of time .
let u avoid useless and costly speculation about the climate .
the measure needed for this , however , have remained a mystery .
it is up to u to now decide what happens next .
then we will at least have made a start .
unfortunately , the result from copenhagen were well below par in the circumstance .
that is the first main reason we are expressing our disappointment .
both the u and china are growing their renewables industry very rapidly .
the european union always want to be a leader , and always ha .
europe should , therefore , reconsider the organisational aspect of such conference .
my third question concern the leading role of the european union .
we are not at that stage , and we should be sorry .
however , that progress will not continue unless the european union keep pushing .
i am sure that the spanish presidency will work towards that end .
not much came of all of the plan that we made here .
i am slightly shocked by some of the speech i have heard here .
simply carrying on and marching forward is not the solution .
what opportunity did we actually have to present that ?
are we using the right instrument to tackle this ?
there are always new timetable , more percentage , new regulation and stipulation .
in copenhagen , we looked back and we stood alone in our ambition .
well , we certainly know it : there is nothing right now .
we had better unite next time , and that mean one voice .
copenhagen stood for much more than a climate summit .
the growing influence of the emerging country wa evident .
we failed to understand the commitment of china and other developing country .
they talk and talk until they have all melted .
it is true that copenhagen wa not a success .
china refuse all measure which would be binding and open to international scrutiny .
climate change can not be resolved on the issue of emission alone .
a sectoral , quantitative vision doe not lead anywhere .
what is more , we have to attach greater importance to science .
how are we going to coordinate on this matter ?
we should have already started working on that this morning .
this also go for expenditure under the european economic recovery plan .
( hu ) mr president , we should not embellish thing .
what do we need in order to achieve this ?
in copenhagen , poland and hungary suggested a compromise .
we suggested a compromise for the sake of a common european position .
in fact , the eu wa virtually inaudible during the final negotiation .
that is the challenge that must be taken up by the eu .
we have commissioner for both foreign policy and climate change .
what is happening about the pledge inside the eu ?
that is why the eu is cut out of the final negotiation .
i am told that the same thing happens at the wto .
i am sorry he is not here for the final session .
let him put his money where his mouth is .
it must not be manufactured and it must not be invented .
however , after copenhagen , our european compatriot are being very hard .
people have described the copenhagen conference a a flop and a failure .
if we are marginalised , a happened in copenhagen ...
now , more than ever , we must maintain our position , minister .
our business must be competitive in a world market .
we should also remember new technology , including technology ( ... ) .
so , please , when are we going to acknowledge that agriculture ...
i ask , therefore , what kind of conclusion come from falsified data ?
i think we need impartial research to verify the effect of co2 .
without scientific credibility , another disaster will be waiting for u in mexico .
the copenhagen summit revealed the new international scenario that surround u .
some have defined copenhagen a a perfect storm with a bittersweet result .
we must stand shoulder to shoulder in our work , facing the future .
mr hassi and many others have called for the eu 's leadership .
but let u also recall that our leadership start at home .
i can reassure you that we want to support 12 demo plant .
in the light of the copenhagen conference , we are all good politician .
let u continue to put our own house in order .
this must be implemented in the coming month and year .
this obliges chinese manufacturer , too , to change course .
why did the proposal concerning co2 emission turn out to be unacceptable ?
the current liberal trade regulation encourage higher carbon dioxide emission .
what is more , energy consumption is increasingly taxed in these country .
we need not only 'fair ' but also 'green ' trade .
the failure of the conference doe not justify idleness .
it ha not played that role for a long time .
the next item is question time ( b7-0002/2010 ) .
i welcome the minister to this first question time with the spanish presidency .
this is a problem that could become prevalent across the eu .
however , what kind of influence are we talking about ?
( pl ) yes , that is precisely what my question is about .
the council ha always reiterated the prospect of the western balkan joining europe .
( de ) president-in-office , i have two further specific question .
however , a i said , the primary point is the visa arrangement .
a you know , the commission is working on the detail of this .
this is a scientific debate rather than a political one .
we therefore need to help promote sustainable forest management .
i would like to wish the spanish presidency well .
i think you are off to a very good start this week .
i believe that this is in line with what we have said .
i wish to thank the council for the reply .
i do not know about the rest of europe .
what we are talking about is feeding a tube into the abdomen .
i think that is the right place to deal with this matter .
i think that is the place and the forum .
it is a very suitable place to take on this leadership .
essentially , social responsibility ha three component - protect , respect and remedy .
it is necessary for all interested party to participate .
there , too , the aim of social responsibility must have a presence .
( fr ) thank you , minister , for your reply .
the problem is that these subsidiary are separate legal entity .
there is also a voluntary part made up of optional practice .
we are used to so many other type of labelling .
why not use this method with regard to social matter , too ?
the path of sanction is not always the best one .
we intend to get this agreement completed during the spanish presidency .
therefore , we will mainly be discussing it with this house .
( de ) thank you for your statement , mr lópez garrido .
you mentioned the macrosupervision area of the european systemic risk board .
i believe that there is a proposal made by the commission .
this is the place to achieve that agreement between the two sphere .
subject : economic situation in greece and role of the euro area
they have no comparison anywhere else in the world .
that , of course , is the responsibility of each state .
i believe that each body ha it own area of work .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.15 and resumed at 21.00 )
the next item is the council and commission statement on democratisation in turkey .
it must be said that turkey ha experienced positive change .
the presidency of the council will continue giving much importance to this matter .
of course , progress is not always straightforward with positive development .
a number of landmark reform have been carried out to date .
they are a telling example of such welcome change and transformation .
in modern europe , quite simply , they are not .
this leaf a question mark hanging over this decision .
yet the kurdish issue is central to the democratisation process in turkey !
this kurdish issue is also placing a huge strain on the democratisation process .
immediate reform will obviously relate to legislation on political party .
political debate is robust and voter have a genuine choice .
there are now , however , perhaps two area of concern .
the first is turkey 's history of military intervention in the political process .
how can we assist with the democratisation of turkey ?
i claim that this can be achieved by telling turkey the truth .
turkey ha turned into a graveyard for political party .
thirteen party have been buried by supreme court judgment .
turkey will be democratised if we talk to it clearly and strictly .
it ha helped the democratisation and modernisation process in turkey .
turkey is an important country that ha many great asset .
i look forward to welcoming him soon in his new portfolio .
the position of the european parliament in this matter is clear .
secondly , turkish democracy is simply quite specific in it own right .
i have to say that i completely disagree with that .
this is hardly a positive vision for a proud nation .
eu-turkey relation go back a long way and are mutually beneficial .
the european perspective is a driving force for democratic reform .
we should never waver on our commitment to turkey 's membership .
there ha to be a clear light at the end of the tunnel .
i think we should pledge to support them on this path .
the result several year later are , unfortunately , very poor .
reform have ground to a halt and those implemented are basically dead letter .
the european parliament ha welcomed the democratic opening announced by the turkish government .
( nl ) madam president , turkey must be treated fairly .
i met dink after the trial of orhan pamuk .
of course , the pkk ha it political front .
the status of child and woman need improving , especially in rural area .
the position of the patriarchate ha already been mentioned here .
you also said that the journey is a important a the destination .
banning political party is a large step back , however .
this can be done by drastically reducing the 10 % electoral threshold .
it remains for me to thank commissioner rehn for his tremendous cooperation .
i wish him every success with his new portfolio .
that is why turkey should be welcomed into the eu fold .
may i also take up another matter connected with turkish membership .
i believe that my fellow member from denmark ha already touched upon this .
the money is not getting to those who need it most .
the rule for applying for project funding are complex and difficult to understand .
it make me wonder whether this can still be called a democratic opening .
another important matter is the ability of woman to participate in public life .
this battle between secularism and democracy is a real challenge in turkey .
the solution proposed by the turkish government are not satisfactory .
trade unionist are prosecuted and sentenced in sham trial .
political assassination and violence by the prosecuting authority continue .
elected representative are being persecuted and jailed en masse .
turkey continues to deny fundamental right to kurd and other minority .
it is threatening greece with casus belli and putting forward territorial claim .
nevertheless , the turko-kurdish peace process ha suffered a severe set back .
the ban on the activity of the party is a typical political ploy .
this applies equally to our member state and the democracy in turkey .
i regret that the eu fails to approach this issue thoroughly .
however , that wa not what i wanted to say .
a european , we must ask ourselves where we actually want to go .
therefore , that process will be of benefit to both interest .
the glass can be half full or half empty .
the role of the european parliament in that process is absolutely vital .
today 's debate ha focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
we have seen tremendous democratic transformation in turkey in the past five year .
the first and foremost of them concern citizen ' right and fundamental freedom .
many author and journalist are still facing prosecution and conviction for their work .
secondly , the past year ha seen important development concerning civil/military relation .
in this major effort , i continue to count on your strong support .
that is essential for this project to succeed in the end .
but in the case of turkey the situation is much more complex .
pre-accession talk have been open since 3 october 2005 .
however , where ha this 'soft power ' got u ?
one option is for small and medium-sized enterprise to conclude more mutual partnership .
the danube is not just a waterway and it is not a road .
that is something that we should give particular consideration to in this connection .
this is exactly how we need to approach the danube .
sustainability and mindfulness of the natural environment are of the utmost importance here .
let u not repeat the mistake of the past !
the danube region is a very specific and indisputably vast territory .
that is why the strategy should be focused on this particular problem .
the european commission will provide technical and coordination support .
such a new impetus for economic growth will also create many job .
this mean that my brother 's farm in that area is at risk .
however , how many of them have been discussed publicly ?
how many of the country have launched the process of public consultation ?
so real ownership of the process is needed here .
the danube country face similar environmental and infrastructural problem .
however , a we all know , the devil is in the detail .
this initiative encompasses 14 country with a population in excess of 200 million .
however , these country vary in term of their economic development .
i believe that this project will help the region develop more actively .
i hope it will become a real priority for the forthcoming period .
two area are of particular concern to me in this regard .
( hu ) i would like to welcome the danube strategy .
this is taken into consideration when creating several policy of the european union .
the strategy say that the ten-t network should be supported .
it is also important to emphasise that we need to remain realistic .
the danube strategy is evidence that the danube is indeed a supra-national river .
the danube should and must be a transport route .
the baltic strategy ha been instrumental in opening up the prospect of macro-regions .
the danube strategy mark a new step in the same direction .
however , increased effort are also needed to find alternative , renewable source .
however , all these numerous project pose a problem at the moment .
the outcome is the exact opposite of that expected .
we have many initiative and form of cooperation of this kind .
how advanced is work on the strategy and it implementation ?
today , we see it a a symbol of cooperation .
the danube must remain a symbol for future generation , too .
they established a public limited liability company with it headquarters in vienna .
a far a hungary is concerned , the danube is particularly important .
this is also reflected in the priority for our 2011 presidency .
we sincerely hope that we will move in this direction .
the vote will take place on thursday , 21 january 2010 .
throughout history , the danube ha played a central role in europe .
there are many point of contact in this context .
macro-regions are ideal instrument for dealing with cross-border challenge .
the next item is the commission statement on eu-tunisia relation .
eu-tunisia relation are governed by an association agreement signed in 1995 .
we believe that such an endeavour is in the interest of the eu .
the next item is the speech of the political group .
it is within this framework that the institution must be strengthened .
however , concrete step really must be taken by tunisia itself .
moreover , it ha succeeded in reducing it debt burden .
they are human right , democracy and the rule of law .
i therefore believe that you are completely deluded on this matter .
there ha been no further progress since that time .
tunisia also rightly take an uncompromising approach to islamist jihadi extremism .
why then do we seek to alienate tunisia and it 10 million people ?
we should respect tunisia a our euro-mediterranean advanced partner .
i would like to welcome you to the gallery .
word come and go ; only the written word remains .
the eu partnership agreement henceforth include clause on democracy and human right .
these clause must be examined just a closely a economic one .
this figure alone reveals the state of democracy within that country .
yes , this is the social situation in tunisia .
student are being arrested and arbitrarily convicted , a are others .
the commission and the council must take this into account .
tunisia must honour it commitment in relation to democracy and human right .
it is unacceptable , in fact , to go ahead with advanced status .
yes , i am in favour of equal partnership !
they have the most stable society in north africa .
only 7 % of the population life below the poverty line .
so maybe we should learn something from the tunisian .
well , that is very interesting , coming out of an islamic country .
that is a common problem in connection with our development and association aid .
we also need to help it to organise itself .
persecution of the christian minority is becoming increasingly disturbing .
a quarter of politician , local official and journalist are woman .
there ha been an alarming decline in the human right situation in tunisia .
the association agreement and the free trade agreement have been mentioned .
i am sympathetic towards anyone who take action against islamic extremist .
we can talk about anything with tunisia because it is a reliable partner .
the issue of gender equality ha also been mentioned .
we had a frank exchange and debated our respective view .
aside from trade relation , we must also take account of social issue .
real progress in the field of human right is now crucial .
when the project is complete , we will ass the outcome .
but let u do that in a well-planned and structured dialogue .
recent attack on religious minority in egypt and in malaysia
violence and hatred can not be accepted in the name of religion .
security measure can not be the only mean to manage a pluralist society .
a free debate is perhaps the most powerful medicine against extremism and violence .
in too many case , the argument of maintaining public order is abused .
this allows for active control of user by the government .
precisely because of it history , europe must commit itself on this front .
personally , i have encountered fewer of these fundamentalist aspiration with buddhism .
mr president , freedom of religion is an essential element of human right .
that is the case , amongst other place , in egypt .
muslim who convert to christianity , for example , are oppressed .
the egyptian government 's attitude , in my view , is spineless .
it is the most unequal society in south-east asia .
the current government rule on the basis of crony capitalism .
in islamic country , non-muslims are systematically humiliated and murdered .
unfortunately , these two case do not exhaust the list of phobia .
there is also a phenomenon called 'christianophobia ' - a phobia of christianity .
christian , too , must not be deprived of our care .
the place of anti-christian communism ha today been taken principally by militant islam .
the resolution we are adopting today should give a clear message .
the copt have been persecuted in egypt for many year .
however , we should also beat our own breast .
should not muslim also be lauded when there is cause to do so ?
let u not tar fanatic and an entire population with the same brush .
the united state administration ha unequivocally spoken up against this .
we keep hearing the same complaint and proposing the same measure .
however , this present a danger to all christian , jew and muslim .
actually , the coptic christian are still a considerable minority .
they are proud of this and also of their oriental christian tradition .
egypt is certainly not one of the worst example of religious intolerance .
egypt 's constitution provides for freedom of belief and free practice of religion .
we raised those issue in our regular political dialogue with egypt .
the fact that he is referred to by different name is absolutely secondary .
no le serious is the persecution of the copt in egypt .
human right violation in china , notably the case of liu xiaobo
author . - mr president , china ha demonstrated impressive economic progress .
this charter ha been bravely co-signed by more than 10 000 chinese citizen .
last month , liu xiaobo wa sentenced to 11 year ' imprisonment .
we ask today for his immediate and unconditional release .
it is this respect that is missing in the resolution .
it is for these political reason that my group ha withdrawn it signature .
the fact is , the human right situation in china is unacceptable .
the european institution must join force and take action on this matter .
chinese internet user must be able to access uncensored information .
not all the event of 1989 have deserved the same attention , however .
this is why we are debating this matter again today .
it ha been suggested that such ideal are somehow alien to asia .
'we should end the practice of viewing word a crime ' .
the european union must strengthen the eu-china human right dialogue .
this dialogue , established in 2000 , proved to be inefficient .
respect for human right must serve a a basis for this policy .
this , of course , applies in particular to the internet .
we can not accept political filtering of the internet .
an english version is available on my website charter08.eu .
i believe the authority should now produce gao zhisheng and release him .
i do not think that that is the right way forward .
there are no other option available to u at the moment .
we all hoped that it would , but it did not work .
therefore , we should not let up with our urgent appeal .
the strength of our relationship allows u to discus those matter frankly .
mr vergiat and mr korhola touched upon the cyber attack against google .
we will remain vigilant in case similar attack target eu company .
we also recall the chinese constitutional guarantee on freedom of expression .
i would like to react to a question from mr de keyser .
apparently , google will be le evil in the future .
this make it the greatest massacre of journalist in world history .
there is a danger of there being further political murder .
quite recently , 57 people were murdered , half of them journalist .
that is the biggest ever death toll among journalist in the world .
now is the time to do everything to ensure they are fair election .
we can not always be acting based on headline .
this is a very disturbing and downright scandalous situation .
this is , truly , an absolutely unacceptable situation .
i will be very brief , because we want to vote .
it is the role of the european parliament to speak on this matter .
the government ha taken some important step in strengthening human right .
we shall also put in place a monitoring system to develop confidence .

recent attack on religious minority in egypt and in malaysia ( vote )
this is why i voted in favour of adopting the resolution .
however , i would ask that bavaria not be neglected in all this .
what , though , is the european union doing in the real world ?
see how hypocrisy ha been elevated into a governing principle !
we bleat about human right , and then we funnel money to hamas .
we need such a revolution again here in europe .
i am also talking about member state of the european union .
the european union is showing a certain solidarity in this way .
i hope it will also be like this in other case .
i am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution presented here .
this will aid integration in case of future eu enlargement .
i am sorry , but this wa not my decision .

this concern member state which are experiencing financial difficulty .
mr president , i would like categorically to support this motion .
i should like to emphatically endorse mr swoboda 's proposal .
they can therefore be seen together , examined together and debated together .
wednesday evening provides an opportunity for the commission to give an answer .
therefore , i invite our colleague to support this proposal .
mr president , if i can make one very small point of order .
this is not true ; we are anti the european union .
the life of mr abu-jamal is now more at risk than ever .
however , the situation in madagascar is absolutely chaotic .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
it could help make the staple diet in the european union healthier .
from an environmental point of view , this is a good thing .
at present , most seagoing passenger and freight vessel use heavy fuel oil .
i have been dealing with codecision legislation for more than 10 year .
we should not be doing thing for which we can not account .
i believe that , in this case , we could not .
i call upon the commission to investigate this matter again .
this is urgent , because there are life at risk .
we want portugal to be a state governed by substantive law !
however , 14 people lost their life in the explosion .
there are dozen of injured and 500 displaced person .
the european union is forcing the irish government to apply these new tax .

mr president , i wish to speak on energy policy .
i therefore welcome recent initiative from the uk government .
i would urge colleague here to do that in the future .
we have heard that the office are acting on our comment .
this is a further act of repression against the polish minority in belarus .
they are not entitled to know what evidence is brought against them .
i believe that we can take the initiative in starting this dialogue .
i wish the congress every success in it work .
the trieste regasification plant technical board ha highlighted some important shortcoming .
the report by mr alvarez on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation ,
the report by mr domenici on promoting good governance in tax matter ,
this is all about loyalty between member state and their tax administration .
unfair competition occurs , leading to inadequate functioning of the market .
the directive currently in force certainly represented a first step along the way .
the new directive represents a qualitative and quantitative leap forward in this respect .
the third new element is the lifting of banking secrecy .
this aim is shared by the report before u today .
there are still many problem to be dealt with .
we are also aiming to increase transparency and cooperation .
particular attention need to be paid to developing country .
this is also in line with the orientation of the ongoing council discussion .
this is also reflected in the council compromise text .
mr president , chance often ha a hand in thing .
however , this parliament will not let a contradiction stop it .
there is none so deaf a those who will not hear .
the majority of country in europe do not have banking secrecy .
is there no way to keep the two issue separate ?
this is why the text that we are discussing today are so important .
with this driving force , the council must be more progressive in future .
however , a my grandmother used to say , that is another story .
i will finish by also saying a word of farewell to mr kovács .
taxation , particularly any form of harmonisation , is always a sensitive issue .
member state must be free to sign bilateral agreement with third country .
cooperation would cease and national security would be put at risk .
( de ) mr president , we need to overhaul the democratic process .
back then , we used to pay million of schilling every year .
i did not do it , but others did .
why do we need to fund school skiing lesson this week ?
the interest of europe a a whole must take precedence over partial viewpoint .
the domenici report give an account of how to close those back door .
all other element of the tax package before u serve this same purpose .
it will ensure both the credibility and the effectiveness of the system .
these are two fundamental demand which have long been supported by many expert .
an answer of which , i believe , we can only be proud .
tax fraud is undoubtedly a major problem which reduces state budget revenue .
we can not afford to increase the size of the bureaucratic machine .
to sum up , then , an automatic exchange of information upon request .
tax fraud ha a major impact on national budget .
it robs public service , health , education and research of vital resource .
asset held offshore are now equal to a third of global asset ...
the second point is on the controversial matter of exchange of information .
this document go much wider and demand automatic exchange in all area .
this is an example of what can not happen !
small and medium-sized enterprise are not getting credit and sacrifice are widespread .
we may criticise the tax burden in our own country .
the most effective way to exchange information is to do so automatically .
the eu ha often been critical of tax haven of various kind .
it ha been a privilege to cooperate with you .
you did not achieve it all , but you did your best .
it is necessary because tax evasion is no mere peccadillo .
we have to work together to fight tax fraud and dubious tax haven .
it may well be though that such purchase is necessary .
furthermore , cross-border dual taxation should be a subject of greater focus .
this directive is an essential statement of our intention to do that .
that came up in the lisbon treaty in the guarantee given to ireland .
i would like to make a few comment about the report themselves .
these are highlighted very obviously in mr casa 's report .
there will be very little tax to cooperate over .
this endless crisis will destroy the federal project - tax cooperation and all .
that also brings u to the subject of tax haven .
i know that these file remain a priority for my successor .
i also see general support for the three proposal .
it is also now a priority for most member state .
there is therefore no reason to have barrier where tax information is concerned .
we must certainly persevere in our effort to simplify the various fiscal system .
i have listened attentively to the view expressed by my fellow member .
i also noticed the abstention on the automatic exchange of information .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 february 2010 .
any proposal will need the approval of member state .
it is not an unimportant element of this debate .
i welcome the commission 's initiative and the work done by the rapporteur .
secondly , it will mean operator in the internal market being treated equally .
therefore , i shall be endorsing the report by mr alvarez with conviction .
the next item is the commission statement on gm/opel : current development .
it is sad to see that the opel/vauxhall group deems plant closure necessary .
i must stress that this decision wa taken by general motor alone .
it is unable to avoid them , but it can anticipate their consequence .
we believe that the position of general motor in europe is unacceptable .
it can be prevented only by mean of a common european approach .
it is not yet too late for this , commissioner špidla .
the european commission stood by a general motor triumphed .
my second point is just a important , commissioner .
i believe we have an urgent need for this .
i am also disappointed with your response and position today , however .
after all , it is indeed a case of unlawful conduct .
we have already held this debate , last september .
that is unacceptable , commissioner ; these are vital matter .
in germany , labour cost have been falling since the same period .
noel belief this is the reason for the closure of opel antwerp .
industrial policy requires that we maintain our competitiveness , mr staes .
what is the situation with the chemical industry in flanders ?
car are being rendered unaffordable , a people should be taking the bus .
car are becoming too expensive for people on lower income .
the chemical industry ha to contend with european climate policy .
all that you have done is defend the general motor plan .
in other word , there is no solidarity between u .
this is a commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy .
spyker pay , but using money from the european investment bank .
why are we saving job in mexico with european taxpayer ' money ?
can we not rebody vectras at the ellesmere port plant in my constituency ?
for that is all saab ha been reduced to .
people want to understand what the european union is doing .
this mean that the german right of participation is being flouted .
the car industry is one of the industry that ha been hardest hit .
from my experience , i would point out a few thing to them .
( ro ) i would like to begin with three vital question .
which direction is the european economy 's competitiveness going in ?
this figure is 20 % in country such a latvia and spain .
this is why i believe that this is such an important subject .
is this not a system that is fundamentally wrong ?
is there not something structurally wrong with this system ?
this ha met with a dubious reception from public opinion .
the assessment of plan ex ante wa similarly unconventional .
this is what we did and this is what we continue to do .
i believe that my successor will be no le strict in this .
this includes the european social fund and the european globalisation adjustment fund .
equality between woman and men in the european union - 2009 ( debate )
the lisbon strategy set an objective of 60 % .
obviously , i believe that we have to combat sexist stereotype .
whilst unquestionable progress ha been achieved in this area , major challenge remain .
by way of illustration , i will mention three of these .
this discrepancy , which amount to 17 % , is quite simply unacceptable .
given the success of this campaign , it will be extended into 2010 .
the commission will work towards this goal with purpose and with great determination .
gender equality is not merely an end in itself .
i do not believe one can talk of a 'comfortable ' majority .
some affirmation therefore need to be put into perspective by mean of amendment .
the latter exists today to prevent pregnancy at a very early age .
first of all , my compliment to the rapporteur .
the green are very happy with this quite progressive report .
it is brimful of plan that we want carried out .
we hope that the commission will take action accordingly .
it say that woman are of a lower status than men .
by the way , the four witness must be muslim , not non-muslims .
you have guessed that i am speaking about sharia law .
surely this is a case of blatant gender discrimination .
the british government ha already officially recognised sharia law in some tribunal .
however , more job doe not always mean more quality job .
several question came up in connection with the report .
the most recent statistic indicate a difference of more than 17 % .
daily experience suggests that improvement in the short term is not likely .
woman are suffering more than anybody else in the economic and social crisis .
we think that this is crucial for woman across europe .
you , mr špidla , have recognised that we need new legal action .
madam president , we female meps are definitely in a minority position .
i think this is the single most important factor in promoting gender equality .
i would like to highlight two thing in particular .
i hope that plenary support the importance of paternity leave .
law on equal treatment between woman and men exist in every member state .
it is an easy solution to ask for new charter .
it is more of an effort to apply the existing instrument .
what would be the use of a new charter of woman 's right ?
no one can say that the legal instrument ignore woman 's right .
that is why i am voting against paragraph 20 .
we must acknowledge that definite progress ha been made with regard to equality .
however , it doe not refer specifically to domestic violence .
unfortunately , this problem is rife and it affect every community .
and yet , support structure for abused woman are basic or even non-existent .
i would like to quote from one recent agency report .
the pvv want to see this backwardness combated with vigour .
it is time for a new wave of emancipation .
it is the economy that is coming up with all the solution .
therefore , the economy should be working to support family and woman .
it ha caused job loss and resulted in financial austerity policy .
however , female employment varies greatly from one member state to another .
the matter of paternity leave ha yet to be resolved .
matter of gender equality must be strengthened and integrated in the new strategy .
the report talk about intensifying this action , but that is not enough .
we have the result of poll which show this .
mr president , woman represent half of europe 's talent .
the union ha produced at least 13 directive on gender equality .
on the gender pay gap , virtually nothing ha moved in recent year .
getting more woman into decision-making position is the key to everything .
important effort are being made and we need to emphasise that .
these state tend to have a healthier economic , social and pension situation .
besides , woman 's salary are of crucial importance in the family .
i can hardly think of anything new to contribute to it .
we need to create the condition for that to become a reality .
realistically , exclusion from an existing salary scheme is probably inevitable .
it is therefore sheer common sense to fight for equality .
let u also try to take that path today .
under such condition , woman will undoubtedly hold their own .
we find similar result with other type of election .
woman must not be in the role of supplicant .
if they have an equal chance , they will win through .
well then , in your case , we can talk about real equality .
we must look for the best applicable solution for this matter .
today , however , i would like to focus on two point .
inequality become narrower in a knowledge society or new form of economy .
i believe that these are important step towards equality .
i consider this report to be lacking in balance .
woman are better educated , but they do not gain promotion .
firstly , the monitoring centre should look at best practice .
the percentage of woman representing romania is 36 % .
woman were seen to have an inferior , subordinate role .
that need to continue through legislation , through target and through directive .
i think we have a lot to do in this area .
gender equality and woman 's right stem from human right .
lady and gentleman , the debate ha been unusually extensive .
i wish you all the best and god bless !
a for the pay gap , mr bauer put it well .
it is , of course , difficult to be precise .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 february .
we have the necessary legal instrument to act on this .
in most european country , segregation by occupation and sector remains almost unchanged .
equality between woman and men is a fundamental principle of the european union .
considerable progress ha been made in this regard down the year .
we are going to vote on this agreement at 12.00 .
we also have the good experience of recent month .
thus , today , we are seeing european democracy in action .
our task is to use the new mechanic to bring on new dynamic .
let u move the discussion from institutional input to policy impact .
frankly , i believe we have to do more .
they are the fruit of our experience over the last five year .
other very important challenge need to be tackled during this mandate .
this is no time for our institution to pull in different direction .
also , several of these issue imply cooperation with the council .
today , a new chapter in our european adventure open .
the woman and men who apply it must measure up to our ambition .
this key figure must be the voice of europe in the world .
that is why the ppe group will vote to appoint the commission .
that is an order that ha taken a vow of silence .
that wa detrimental in the hearing for some of the new people .
the commission is strong when it act a a collegial body .
we therefore also need an effective commission that will take on this role .
what we need is effective cooperation between the european institution .
however , mr barroso can not be blamed for everything .
that is what will make the european union count in the world .
for our part , mr barroso , we expect three thing of you .
do not think that weak coordination of national economic strategy is sufficient .
that is a great political strategy , that is !
that is the new mathematical formula of the barroso commission .
i have not seen it ; i have not heard it .
one of greece 's problem is it defence budget .
4.3 % of greece 's gdp go on defence .
the problem is cyprus ; it is the relationship with turkey .
the commission 's initiative : it doe not have one !
the same point ha been made with regard to haiti .
therefore , i believe that we have a problem .
he is not saying why he did not play his role .
let u wake up , because europe need it !
if you take this route , you can rely on u .
you can expect no applause for this from my group .
now i could go on but we would be here for some time .
poor greece , trapped inside the economic prison of the euro !
what greece need , mr barroso , is devaluation , not sado-monetarism .
goodness know what that is going to do to them .
in 1968 , we had the brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty .
article 121 will be invoked with all of those .
in the course of the hearing , the commissioners-designate scarcely said anything concrete .
they did not want to make a commitment , to accept responsibility .
the close collaboration of these institution is necessary in order to achieve result .
lady and gentleman , let u press that restart button .
i would like to focus on the strong point .
i also firmly believe that baroness ashton will coordinate this team well .
let u not always make ourselves out to be worse than we are !
we have an opportunity now to make a good impression .
where economic policy is concerned , we have a strong team .
we disagreed sometimes , but we worked well together .
i therefore call on the commission and the council to take this seriously .
this is a practice that we in this parliament can no longer tolerate .
the commission 's proposal are not yet legislation for u .
it is a pity that this is happening so late .
mr president , i hope it is worth waiting for .
i would ask president barroso , once again , to address those question .
in my group , however , we completely disagree with this political project .
i therefore draw the conclusion that this commission accepts social dumping .
seventy year ago , the communist soviet union attacked tiny finland .
we defended our independence and our right of selfdetermination .
the eu is a bureaucracy and not a democracy .
i am in favour of cooperation between independent state .
each of u got vote ; i got 130 000 vote in finland .
how many vote did the commissioner get and where did they get them ?
here they might get 300 vote , but that is about it .
none of that is very important or very interesting .
you are going to have many people to deal with .
you have become totally indifferent to the fate of european worker .
mr president , perhaps i can correct mr gollnisch .
we therefore unreservedly support the commission led by mr barroso .
the economic and social crisis is undoubtedly going to cause increased social unrest .
this , a far a my political family is concerned , is unacceptable .
unfortunately , however , this doe not surprise me .
there are two thing we want from you , mr barroso .
please be courageous and make europe strong , both inside and out .
this comment is intended for you , in particular , baroness ashton .
the internal market is not functioning well enough for small and medium-sized enterprise .
this is often due to national , rather than european , bureaucracy .
i am pleased that the commission ha now put forward a proposal .
but in some of these nomination he ha been let down .
that is the first problem , and the second is one of signal .
i am not completely happy with the result of the impact assessment .
i would like to ask you how you actually intend to handle this .
please do not tell u that it is the college that will decide .
you are not almighty and you belong to a college .
i have serious difficulty with this , mr barroso .
i do not yet know how i will vote later .
that will depend very much on your answer to our question .
the trust and confidence that we assume from our citizen is fading away .
what is the aim of collecting data on energy infrastructure ?
mr president , greece is on the verge of fiscal collapse .
spain and portugal are also struggling with increasing difficulty .
the way the system ha changed ha already been mentioned .
it is the fourth commission since i came here .
that is better for europe and better for cooperation with parliament .
we want fair cooperation with you and the commission .
in principle , they are supposed to work for equal development throughout europe .
the first aspect wa cast into doubt during the hearing .
mr ashton did touch on some detail , but her answer were disappointing .
many of u answered , and still answer today , in the negative .
there are , in fact , many thing to be done .
so , mr barroso , do not be scared , be bold !
the prospect of a return to strong growth ha never been so distant .
solidarity among the member state ha never been so necessary .
the citizen ' expectation have never been so high .
you worked with u on this and you worked earnestly on it .
i respect that and very much appreciate how you have contributed to this .
the impact assessment have already been mentioned by other member .
you said that social impact assessment are important to you .
i am referring here to the legislative monopoly of the commission .
my second point is about the common external action service .
i am looking at your vice-president , lady ashton .
we deplore the fact that we are absent from the high level group .
we should be involved in the nomination of ambassador and eusrs .
their background , in both case , seems to me to be appropriate .
that requires policy for new job , investment and dynamic economic growth .
european voter gave a very clear message in june .
mr president , the european community is more than 50 year old now .
your second term coincides with the 60th anniversary of the schuman declaration .
the european commission ha been the european parliament 's main ally and collaborator .
we wish you and the whole college of commissioner well .
that is exactly what we expect from the new commission .
the first word in a novel are always the most difficult to write .
we need common financial market supervision and a financial transaction tax .
political observer agree that the new commission contains no real political heavyweight .
the trans-european network in particular ought to be improved .
we also need to improve vocational education and training .
that is a major task for the european commission .
frankly , i think this is a case of extreme populism .
in my opinion , that is a wrong decision .
the second point i would like to make is about the interinstitutional agreement .
what can we say after two month of it function ?
the point being that we need strong personality and strong face .
they have helped many individual , community and business .
they have been particularly important during recent difficult economic time .
a great deal ha been said today about overcoming the crisis .
is it going to be one of the commissioner ?
the euro area ha been an area of stability and job creation .
of course , it wa affected by the crisis .
non-euro area country were also affected by the crisis .
we have yet to reap the full benefit of the euro .
it is true that we do not have just a monetary union .
the treaty give new opportunity , which i intend to make use of .
the period the euro area is going through is a difficult one .
other country outside the euro area are also facing very difficult time .
in today 's policy , this is a normal tendency .
more and more issue are transversal or horizontal by nature .
so this is exactly what we intend to do .
i think this is also critically important for the future .
the cohesion policy ha been enshrined in the treaty of lisbon .
by it nature , it is a european policy .
i want to make clear what i have said publicly before .
we believe we have made a lot of progress on impact assessment .
some member of this parliament put question to me regarding energy security .
this underline how important we believe this agenda is .
it is very important to relaunch the internal market now .
some people believe that we defend market because we are market fundamentalist .
without an internal market , we will not have a strong european union .
the international financial crisis ha shown just how interdependent our economy are .
it is respected in trade term , i can assure you of that .
our competition law are respected by all the major international conglomerate .
on the contrary , we were by far the most ambitious .
for me , 'dimension ' mean depth , it mean scope .
it is something very ambitious , in any case .
i wish to work with parliament in this spirit .
this is not about making thing more difficult , quite the opposite !
therefore , i say this with a great deal of conviction .
she ha the responsibility and the ability to play that role .
we have a system that is an improvement on the internal system .
we now have the high representative and vice-president of the commission .
i shall conclude by making an appeal to this house .
however , the commission alone will be unable to see them through .
some political group said that they would vote against u .
we are aware of the responsibility which rest on the european parliament .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 9 february 2010 .
we can not but vote against this new commission .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.50 and resumed at 12.05 )
framework agreement on relation between the european parliament and the commission (
( the sitting wa suspended at 12.10 and resumed at 13.30 )
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
thank you very much , and congratulation once again .
i believe we now have the condition to go to work .
voting time is closed , and it is a time for congratulation .
lady and gentleman , we will now proceed to the explanation of vote .
there are 16 member who wish to give an explanation of vote .
you have benefited a great deal from them , my friend !
where would you be now without the solidarity stabiliser ?
europe must defend it value , peace and the prosperity of it citizen .
it must not deprive itself of the tool that come with it power .
it is also necessary for u to ass this college .
these two group have conflicting ideology and must vote accordingly .
however , this is not the way that europe work .
we do not have a majority in this parliament .
it is therefore very difficult for u to weigh up the benefit .
in this respect , you have largely accommodated u .
when i say 'you ' , i mean the college of commissioner .
the s & d group will support this commission .
our support is conditional , more so than during the last five year .
the lisbon treaty offer new tool and ha enhanced our capacity for action .
high representative ashton , we ask you to use these new tool .
we expect more from a high representative than we have seen until now .
your role demand it and the european union requires it .
the lesson we learned from haiti is an example .
will parliament be part of the ordinary legislative procedure ?
i can give you a whole host of example .
we made a mistake , and we admit it .
some group are disunited ; we are united in that position .
some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on u .
we are le enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolio .
in this regard , all of our question related primarily to political project .
in what direction should the european integration process go ?
which measure are most important to the commission candidate ?
but they did not need to use any bullet to do it .
they were much cleverer , much more scheming than that .
these would have been the people who made all the law .
but , still , the new boss would not listen to the people .
the moral of the story is that they had learnt nothing from history .
yet , what are we being offered here today by the commission ?
yet , why do you not want mr karas ?
unfortunately , we are also still not allowed to elect individual commissioner .
( fr ) mr president , my sentiment exactly .
therefore , mr gollnisch is a innocent a mr dreyfus .
i did not say that baroness ashton wa a communist .
it wa only supposed to be a personal statement .
it ha rightly been said that parliament ha more power .
a well a being the european executive , it initiate legislation .
who , though , are we going to appoint to exercise these power ?
yet , mr president , that is the least of her failing !
baroness ashton and her federalist friend treat u a anti-europeans .
the agreement adopted today will form an important basis for this .
she would not pas any examination at all in poland .
this is another reason why i abstained from voting .
these are reason enough not to vote for this new european commission .
we heard mr barroso talk about a europe that responds to a crisis .
she is not fit to be responsible for foreign security and defence policy .
the commission is the new de facto government of the european union .
we are now governed by communist , collaborator and quisling .
we need a commission , and we have one now .
i think we would have a better team by doing that .
i hope it will not only flourish but also bear fruit .
i abstained on the framework agreement between the european parliament and the commission .
for this reason , i have voted against the motion for a resolution .
i have therefore decided to abstain from the vote .
we are nationalist , valuing the sovereignty of the nation state .
given the above , i voted against the motion .
yet what they really stand for is even now still unclear sometimes .
we can not support this unjustified institutionally risky venture .
we thus look ahead to the period 2010-2014 with some trepidation .
all member state are feeling the full magnitude of the financial crisis .
what strategy will get u out of the crisis ?
how should we respond to the social and climate emergency ?
on that basis , it can not have our support .
continuing with this policy will scupper the expectation of european citizen .
parliament exercised it competence and the process had dignity , incisiveness and transparency .
of course , i also voted in favour of it .
it is based on non-transparent decision in the national party and government office .
no criterion relating to specialised knowledge were applied in the selection process .
political personality like the french and spanish european commissioner will founder here .
the vote today concern the college of 26 commissioner .
i voted in favour of the new 'barroso ii ' commission .
it would have made no sense to reject the college .
i shall judge the commission on it political initiative .
the outcome of the negotiation between the commission and parliament is also satisfactory .
i do not consider the composition of the commission to be ideal .
in writing . - we all wish this new commission well .
this should be the major pillar on which this new commission is judged .
therefore , i abstained on the vote on the new commission .
it is currently merely a european parliament wish list , with no obligation .
i have therefore voted 'yes ' today to the new barroso commission .
i shall therefore vote against a commission that is the antithesis of this .
i voted in favour of the barroso commission mark ii for two reason .
we have had to wait a long time for the new european commission .
unfortunately , some state are not guided by this attitude .
five year ago , two candidate failed , this year one .
research and innovation are major driving force for change .
mr barroso committed to 3 % investment in research and development .
the commission ha made a clearer commitment in this regard .
economic recovery will largely come a a result of changing our energy model .
the future of the economy is the future of the green economy .
he allowed five extremely crucial year to pas by .
a lack of a collective response is feeding public cynicism and political nihilism .
barroso 's weak and vague policy plan give little hope for change .
barroso lack vision and political boldness , and this doe europe no favour .
while some of the nominated commissioner are competent , others are not .
the post of high representative is a product of the lisbon treaty .
i do not approve of that treaty or it creation .
while i could approve some individual , others i would vote against .
in the interest of the solidarity of our group , i abstained .
mr barroso , you have shown skill in electing the commission .
there are also some who definitely have the potential to develop .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
difficult monetary , economic and social situation of eurozone country ( debate )
the euro area a a whole is no longer in recession .
it is , however , true that job creation is falling behind .
it is therefore reasonable for the stimulus not to be abandoned during 2010 .
there are still disparity between the economic position in the union .
coordinated public policy have been effective when they have truly been coordinated .
this tight reporting system will ensure that the plan will materialise a planned .
what are the next step in this very detailed process of surveillance ?
each report will be subject to a commission assessment .
it deserves support in this difficult task , and the commission support greece .
admittedly it is month too late , but it is absolutely necessary .
the same must also apply to other country in the danger zone .
there are three thing we can learn from the present situation .
the presidency should not allow itself to be intimidated in this regard .
however , there is a need for modernisation in more than one country .
he deserves our trust and we should give him our support .
i therefore think that the approach ha been wrong .
neither should it be said that nobody wa aware of greece 's problem .
a strategy or a recommendation , commissioner : let u solve this ourselves !
finally , my last point , which is about more than greece .
you will have our political group 's full support in this undertaking .
certain euro member state are facing the same issue right now .
greece ha to raise eur 31 billion over the next few week .
with the lisbon strategy , we have dismantled the social state .
there is no point in creating a european economic government .
clearly , today , we are failing on that score .
this is what we must focus our attention on .
unfortunately , spain , portugal and italy also have high budget deficit .
the netherlands made a start on this a much a a year ago .
the southern european member state have left it too late .
mr verhofstadt , could you please also listen to me ?
you are continuing a normal with your disastrous policy .
who is knocking on the door of the european union ?
poor country that are also suffering under enormous corruption .
mr president , this policy of immigration must stop .
nevertheless , i will gladly begin my speech now .
lastly , courage must be shown in order to tax speculative capital movement .
now it is strangling greece and other client state of the euro .
this should be a warning for any country outside the eurozone .
we have to say how we have ended up here .
what are the affected country doing to get themselves out of debt ?
for these reason , each member country ha it obligation .
the lisbon strategy did not work because it had neither mean nor instrument .
that is what i expect and i trust them to do it .
unfortunately , however , nothing of that wa heard here .
however , they should not form this basis alone .
both strategy need to be supported by sustainable growth and employment policy .
we need to combine the europe 2020 strategy with the other strategy .
these sensible , necessary measure have been obstructed for five year .
the european union is facing it greatest challenge since it formation .
it is time for reform , imagination and integration .
greece obviously ha huge financial problem , but it can deal with them .
i also heard that the main problem for the euro is the speculator .
when the euro wa strengthened , what were the speculator then ?
we need to look at what we are doing wrong .
let u not forget , however , that the statistic were also european .
nevertheless , the euro ha become the most stable currency in the world .
in fact , the dollar and the euro form a duopoly .
there will always be movement between the two currency .
which country is putting the world 's financial stability in danger ?
what these country need is solidarity and the right signal .
they were unfortunate and imprudent statement which had immediate effect on the market .
greece , portugal , ireland and spain are the most affected .
behind them , however , the entire euro area is at risk .
after all , that is what economic union is all about .
a a percentage of gdp , sipri report that greece waste 3.3 % .
greece ha no colony to exploit , but it doe have staying power .
who is next , spain , portugal , italy or ireland ?
for this , absolutely crucial and forceful measure are needed .
this mean that our budget deficit must drop below 3 % .
the problem is not that the market were reserved , a you said .
the problem is that the market speculated and speculated wantonly .
seeking it cause in the economic crisis is only partially justified .
secondly , the discipline of the stability and growth pact wa not maintained .
however , the rule in my view have not been effective .
how do you intend to deal with such a difficult issue in future ?
that is , to reduce their government spending drastically by so-called internal devaluation .
naturally , this immediate intervention had to result in deficit .
mr canfin asked me what proposal the spanish presidency ha in this respect .
there have been short-term intervention by the government , which i have mentioned .
'the union shall take measure to ensure coordination of the employment policy . '
mr bullmann mentioned the need for socio-political coordination , a did mr podimata .
mr verhofstadt talked about the need for internal cohesion in the union .
the commission asked for those power and the council did not grant them .
that would create a climate for future imbalance and future crisis .
lady and gentleman , greece will not manage on it own .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
progress made on resettling guantánamo detainee and on closing guantánamo ( debate )
so it wa not something that just happened 'over there ' .
that is one of the reason we have kept our continuing interest .
however , it is extremely frustrating that nearly 200 men remain there .
the best response to the terrorist is criminal conviction .
this would be very convenient in preventing his testimony before uk court .
mr czarnecki , will you accept a question from mr hautala ?
in reality , it is a transatlantic cooperation problem .
in essence , however , we first need to clarify three point .
what is it that we are not doing but could still do ?
this concern 50 prisoner : those declared to be suitable for release .
this is a figure that should be manageable for the 27 .
they are victim and must be accommodated safely on european soil .
it is exemplary . it must serve a an example .
it is a response to a wish expressed by europe .
however , the european union ha much in common with this .
it is very important that we help president obama to close guantánamo .
we all need to face up to our responsibility .
we have to ask what can be done about this .
are we certain these inhumane technique are now no longer used there ?
it is important for u to be in line with this .
i believe that this is something that need to be pointed out .
this is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate .
key objective for the conference of the party to the cite ( debate )
thirdly , there is the protection of the polar bear .
up to this point , there is consensus among u .
the european union is one of the major market for wildlife product .
the common eu position will then be adopted by the council .
international trade is limited but might exacerbate the pressure on the specie .
when there are no fish , there is no catch .
so the scientific part of the debate ha been resolved .
now let u examine it from a political and social perspective .
the regulation of fishery ha so far failed to deliver .
the s & d group ha tabled an amendment to this effect .
it will allow stock of bluefin tuna to recover and trade to resume .
otherwise , job and a beautiful and unique specie will be lost forever .
we have a commissioner and a minister just going through the motion .
the target which it ha set itself will fail completely .
we have a strong resolution in front of u .
this is crucial for the survival of this specie .
however , i want to pay specific attention to just one .
unfortunately , this ha turned out to be a far from effective instrument .
unfortunately , this fish is now on the point of dying out .
that is why quota do not offer any comfort .
they make no sense , a a result of the illegal catch .
the only salvation for the bluefin tuna is an international trade ban .
lady and gentleman , in the seventeenth century , human exterminated the dodo .
let u look at what the science tell u .
that is not the long term , that is tomorrow .
stock of tuna in the mediterranean sea are also gravely threatened .
my country ha been working towards this for year .
we need to get to the root of the problem .
in order to save fishing , we need to save the specie .
to treat the fishing industry in europe in this way is unacceptable .
it is vitally important that iccat is allowed to do it job .
further reduction in the total allowable catch will occur in 2012 and 2013 .
the measure undertaken by iccat must be carefully monitored .
that is certainly not a sensible way to proceed .
in the face of such figure , the solution seems obvious .
my question therefore concern the condition of this support .
what is the commission 's view on the subject ?
what will the new control and penalty measure consist of ?
supporting this certainly doe not make feel me like a criminal .
the spirit of the motion for a resolution is absolutely worthy of support .
the bluefin tuna is threatened with extinction because of intensive overfishing .
we must not allow the bluefin tuna to suffer the same fate .
nonetheless , i think that the committee 's proposal is a good one .
we must remember that bluefin tuna feed a eur 6 billion global market .
european fisherman face strong - often unfair - competition from north african country .
we must ensure that everyone is playing the game by the same rule .
but it is clear that it is not enough .
in catalonia , hundred of job are at stake .
our proposal is indeed based on the scientific advice to cite .
these two statement are in direct contradiction to each other .
everything else is manipulation and conditioning of this parliament and many member .
if not , then i would like to be told that .
on that point , i agree with the previous speaker .
therefore , the compromise wa made to implement new control measure if necessary .
without this identity marking , there can be no trade .
they will continue unless we have effective policing of these rule and regulation .
i think we need to focus on the result .
we know that the council ha parliament 's full support in this .
this will need to balance short-term and long-term perspective on this issue .
the practical impact of such a listing would be uncertain .
finally , i will comment on mr kelly 's question .
is the commission happy with scientific evidence on many issue ?
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12 noon .
including coral in appendix ii therefore seems excessive and uncorroborated by scientific data .
nearly 1 % of the labour force would lose their job .
eligibility of housing intervention in favour of marginalised community ( debate )
furthermore , the arrangement will apply to every country in the european union .
the implementation of these policy is not an easy task .
indeed , there are numerous example of urban renovation project .
rubbish is often found strewn around the street and backyard in these district .
we know from our own experience that socially marginalised group live here .
that would be blatant discrimination against the other group .
however , that is precisely what this proposal doe .
the eu ha 27 member state divided up into 271 region .
now fund are to be disbursed to all member state .
the public mood in britain is one of growing dismay .
to own the hearth , the stool and all !
the new text stipulates a rate of 4 % .
this also includes those area affected by disaster such a flooding or earthquake .
i firmly believe that this financial imbalance must be corrected .
these people need to know that this parliament recognises their need .
these are issue that we need to address a well .
the second step is the one being taken today .
financial support must be offered for housing in both urban and rural area .
secondly , two comment on the substance of the debate .
this framework is now being offered to the member state in legislation .
there is no certainty that it will subsequently be given priority .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
we can not let european taxpayer ' money be spent on dead end .
recent earthquake in haiti ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
situation in iran ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
situation in yemen ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
trafficking in human being ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
2009 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia
we will also have to close provisionally some chapter with financial implication .
therefore , a great deal of work lie ahead .
we believe that we could achieve new goal in that area .
all of these topic are reflected in various section of parliament 's resolution .
this is what the european union belief and will continue to believe .
a number of technically difficult negotiating chapter await u .
i would also like to mention some other aspect of the council conclusion .
i will now give the floor to commissioner füle .
we are encouraged by recent development in fighting corruption .
we hope that investigation into wrongdoing lead to concrete result .
it achieved visa liberalisation , and the commission could recommend starting accession negotiation .
now the challenge for the country is to maintain the reform momentum .
the economic crisis ha not left the country untouched .
equally important , it will enhance the european perspective for the wider region .
it is therefore in the strategic interest of the european union .
a number of landmark reform have been carried out in the past year .
some of them were next to impossible only a few year ago .
we will observe closely the follow-up of this conciliation .
we continue to support the democratic opening launched by the government .
we condemn the terrorist attack that took place at the same time .
i hope that the same thing will happen soon in slovenia .
however , there is still some work to be done .
it may be that some of them have never existed .
last week , the fyrom parliament passed a resolution on srebrenica .
that is an empirical fact and one which can be proven .
let u do everything we can to reach this goal .
i will begin with open debate , democratic opening .
mr president , we have clear expectation of the council and the commission .
three negotiating chapter remain to be opened by the council .
i believe that this will also be the case today .
there have been repeated attack on people from these minority group .
we are looking forward to croatia joining the european union soon .
effective government measure against growing anti-semitism in public life in turkey .
a turkish academic recently spoke of a poisoned atmosphere .
( nl ) mr füle , welcome to the house !
i therefore hope that you will all support this amendment .
when i wa visiting turkey , the press wa even moved on .
lady and gentleman , we can but express our disgust about this .
next , i want to mention the negotiation with turkey .
thus , i hope that you will all support my amendment .
obviously , our political group would have placed greater emphasis on certain aspect .
we need to send out a clear message on that point .
we welcome this very much and are very pleased about it .
the visa liberalisation wa perhaps the clearest and most visible sign .
is it heading towards a multicultural europe or towards a pan-islamic state ?
christian writer and academic are having to go into hiding .
when will turkey have to comply with the ankara protocol ?
when will the illegal military occupation of cyprus be brought to an end ?
on turkey , the socialist and democrat group remains pro-accession , pro-reform .
to our cypriot colleague we understand the pain of injustice you feel .
these argument are loathsome and repellent , and so are you .
the member of that family will obviously have to be put in prison .
i believe that our process must be totally sincere .
i have one or two question for the commission .
i agree that the turkish garrison in northern cyprus should be much reduced .
let u not blame turkey for the eu 's internal difficulty .
i believe that this is happening in the current negotiation .
i therefore say that lesbian , gay and bisexual right are non-negotiable .
but again , on anti-discrimination , i wish them to go further .
if we undermine the principle of accession , we have no principle left .
however , i would like to discus the subject of turkey .
let u take the example of the armed force .
that , of course , is not a good thing .
there is also the 'private war ' against the doğan group .
another example is that of the role of woman .
i do not think that this is the case .
i would also like to say something about what mr howitt ha said .
during this process , we are not only responsible for the accession candidate .
mr president , mr lambsdorff made an accusation against the united kingdom .
these are all area which are not exactly marginal .
i recognise this and i am pleased about it .
a europe without that balkan lung is not europe .
this is something which is , truly , very important .
father still sell their daughter or swap them for cattle .
the men who buy wife treat them like slave .
the name issue is a real political issue in greece .
see the last report of the un high commissioner for refugee .
however , this is an issue that is still pending .
my second comment relates to the word 'comprehensiveness ' .
we must give a clear 'yes ' or 'no ' .
turkey is playing a very negative role in those negotiation .
that is the path turkey is taking at the moment .
justice is now the area in which hard-hitting reform is still required .
we wish to speak the language of truth with turkey .
it is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in croatia .
the rapporteur ha submitted a very balanced draft resolution .
the resolution rightly urge freedom of religion and freedom of expression .
that is a matter of credibility and moral authority .
accession to the union is the only option to stabilise the region .
i should like to quote another of the council 's conclusion .
madam president , i should like to welcome commissioner füle and the minister .
so , negotiating the transformation demand a major act of political will .
the greatest problem of adaptation , though , lie elsewhere .
that may turn out to be the harder task .
may i start by congratulating hannes swoboda on his report on croatia .
however , we can not have à la carte accession tailored to turkey .
we expect an equally honest stand from the other side .
( bg ) madam president , commissioner füle , welcome to the house .
history must bring u together and not tear u apart .
i want to mention in particular the schoolbook which child use in school .
they must not contain description inciting a hostile attitude towards other member state .
i wish croatia , macedonia and turkey every success on their european journey .
the whole process support stability and we should keep up the momentum .
in my opinion , the name issue should not come first .
one further point is also very important to me .
we know this from the history of the european union .
there will always be progress and setback in the process in turkey .
a i have said , both side must fulfil their undertaking .
that mean completing the project of a united europe in the south-east .
we need not only a european perspective , but dynamism and stimulation too .
mention ha also been made of the arbitration agreement between slovenia and croatia .
( nl ) neighbour look after one another , they support each other .
it is not just turkey that ha to make an effort , however .
croatia is showing a good level of regulatory harmonisation with the acquis communautaire .
( e ) madam president , may i welcome the commissioner .
given the time restriction , i shall just make a few brief comment .
cypriot are not second-class citizen of some sort of ottoman or other colony .
croatia handed over all it wanted war criminal year ago .
therefore , a common sense approach is needed to these question .
it is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the cyprus issue .
that is a fact and we must resolve these double standard .
turkey is welcome to membership on the basis of meeting the copenhagen criterion .
i think this could be seen a a condition for proceeding with negotiation .
it is generally the ethnic conflict that are discussed , and rightly so .
this ha happened recently in the dispute involving the tekel worker .
that is one of the comment that i would like to make .
turkey is adapting to the eu and this includes the area of privatisation .
we also wish this for the country we are talking about today .
these two debate intersect at one point , they have one common ground .
the union 's institution refer to this country a fyrom .
these provision are legally binding in term of international law .
decision must be taken on the performance of the applicant country .
we support the statement that mr lópez garrido gave u this morning .
madam president , i have a brief comment on turkey .
turkey still ha some very serious problem in the area of human right .
these minority are suffering from constant violation of their right .
false promise are detrimental for both them and u .
madam president , i would like to speak on the issue of turkey .
the thought of turkey joining is not on at all .
the people in our country have been denied a vote on lisbon .
the addition of turkey joining will just make matter far , far worse .
commissioner , it is your first day at work .
do we still consider the value , the shared european value , important ?
do we deem the cultural heritage of europe important a a cohesive force ?
naturally , we should aim to establish the best possible partnership with them .
another important factor is that their accession would create a precedent .
today , talk are still in progress on further area related to accession .
i believe that to be very important in purely psychological term .
i can assure you that greek are neither nationalist nor expansionists .
we hope to open other negotiation chapter during the spanish presidency .
first , i take the promise i made during the hearing very seriously .
the first is strict commitment to the copenhagen criterion ; they are non-negotiable .
fourthly , i will never underestimate the issue of integration capacity .
nevertheless , i remain concerned about restriction on press freedom and medium pluralism .
it is therefore important that the necessary preparation are being continued with rigour .
the commission remains committed to the accession process with turkey .
the vote will take place during today 's vote .
however , macedonia still ha a number of reform to implement .
measure must be taken against corruption within the institution .
in 2007 , rumania and bulgaria became member state of the european union .
let me give you a few example on this point .
this difference is a serious obstacle in building a common identity .
eligibility of housing intervention in favour of marginalised community (
( de ) mr president , i have no problem with the machine .
( de ) mr president , this ha been discussed with the group .
i will read the text out briefly in english :
however , a it ha been worded confusingly , we are withdrawing it .
amendment 1 is about raising our ambition level to more than 20 .
amendment 10 - our amendment - is about clarifying condition to minus 40 .
this is a new idea and we should vote on it .
equality between woman and men in the european union - 2009 (
key objective for the conference of the party to the cite ( vote )
( it ) we have not voted on the original text .
we can not create a precedent , the voting can not be repeated .
in any case , there is a difference of 130 vote .
2009 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia (
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
mr president , the greatest constraint on a government is external competition .
the good news is that the electorate doe not like it .
take the example of a plucky country like the cayman island .
what it try to do is avoid double taxation .
people from eu country still pay tax within their member state .
if colleague doubt that , then i suggest they look around them .
thank you , mr president . i wanted to stress this point .
the european union ha done it share and continues to do so .
we would have preferred her to hurry out there to do her job .
we would have liked her to be in haiti helping others .
we must also prevent the risk of child trafficking .
only rarely can earthquake such a this be predicted .
now the solidarity of the european union is also being gauged .
they were accused by a french minister of having occupied the country .
this being so , we need to find a new path .
we should take note of the great culture and history of this country .
we should see the future authority of iran a a partner .
we continue to receive information about further execution and more death sentence .
we have to deal with this subject again and again .
europe must take more decisive action to restrict this shameful procedure .
that must not be so : we need concrete action .
human trafficking is also still a serious problem within the european union .
it is very easy to refrain from acting because others are doing nothing .
there are many thing we can do to maintain our strong stance .
we can not resolve additional problem without additional resource .
that is why we are taking on this responsibility here today .
mr president , i welcome the opportunity to support this resolution .
the copenhagen summit wa a disappointment in many respect .
we have to enhance and promote further activity aimed at climate change treatment .
how can we negotiate more effectively with the developing country and emerging economy ?
it is important for u to discus this and make our opinion known .
i have experienced a great deal in my long career a a politician .
for this reason , i have voted against this motion for a resolution .
the environment is altogether too important to be left to the left .
let u look at our own behaviour here in this european parliament .
for a start , we have two european parliament building .
we have come up with panic solution based on distorted information .
the ganges delta is rising a a result of alluvial deposit .
how are we to explain this difference between the two union ?
we have country that have run up big debt .
so , really , what should we be doing ?
secondly , it suggests an eu-level levy on taxation area .
we have resisted plan for this parliament to have europe-wide tax .
i did so despite being a supporter of gender equality .
in my country , abortion is not understood in this way .
i am persuaded that how we view abortion is our own internal matter .
unfortunately , i regret that i could not support this proposal .
mr president , the treaty of rome contains one sentence on this subject .
then it defined 'equal work ' a being work of equivalent value .
is it a question of how hard it look like someone is working ?
do they have to factor in the availability of suitably qualified applicant ?
there is an argument for all of these thing .
it is outrageous for them to be imposed on u by a court .
mr president , let me tell you the story of two african country .
that of course constitutes interference with the competence of the slovene parliament .
and yet , this principle ha not been enshrined in the arbitration agreement .
( c ) mr president , i , too , will be brief .
( c ) i will be very brief again .
however , we do want close economic and political cooperation .
missing trader then fail to remit the vat to the national exchequer .
it is crucial that we tackle this kind of crime .
i welcome the application of the reverse charge vat system .
only subject c selling the final good to the consumer pay vat .
that is why i voted in favour of this legislative resolution .
i welcome the amendment made by parliament , which support territorial cohesion .
this justifies the adoption of a special rule within the erdf regulation .
it ha a duty and the mean to ensure this .
the eu can not allow itself to become a socially underdeveloped region .
and for this reason , i will vote in favour of the report .
this report give the eu concrete mean for helping it citizen .
we will be carefully watching the treatment of these issue a they progress .
this inconsistency can not even be justified in the name of efficiency .
this is putting the smooth operation of the internal market at risk .
the scope should also be extended to compulsory social security contribution ' .
the statistic show u that the overall recovery rate is just 5 % .
that is why i voted in favour of this resolution .
haiti and it people need fire-fighters , doctor , hospital and basic necessity .
we will continue to express our sincere solidarity with the people of haiti .
this make the catastrophe even bigger than the 2004 asian tsunami .
mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution on haiti .
it wound need tending and it home need building one by one .
the distress of the mass is always the distress of the single person .
the tragedy ha turned the eye of the entire world on haiti .
therefore , i support the call to cancel haiti 's international debt .
however , the proposed text doe not do this in the best way .
the adopted text doe not make any mention of this .
this lead u to condemn the policy pursued by the iranian regime .
this is a result , among other thing , of misguided u policy .
it is extremely important for u to reopen the dialogue with iran .
however , tightening sanction against iran is not the right approach to take .
apart from this , the eu is once again applying double standard .
in writing . - the ecr supported a strong resolution on iran .
combating poverty and increasing military aid will not make yemen 's problem disappear .
such a situation can be exploited by criminal gang .
sadly , this terrible reality also take place within the european union .
mr president , i endorsed adoption of the resolution on human trafficking .
it is horrifying how common this terrible phenomenon is .
human trafficking is a negation of liberty , dignity and equality .
all form of slavery , 'modern ' or otherwise , are utterly reprehensible .
human trafficking is the most flagrant form of human right violation .
the detection rate for this type of crime is very low .
it took lawyer a long a three year to ratify it .
allowing the eu to set tougher sanction in this area ,
reference to the treaty of lisbon strengthening eu action in criminal matter ,
and the establishment of a superordinate legislative framework in this area .
in writing . - ukip belief that environmental protection is important .
we can not lose sight of our commitment to combating climate change .
a new 'climate diplomacy ' is required to achieve this purpose .
we can not repeat the same error that occurred in copenhagen .
what we need is another economic and social model that opposes capitalism .
i voted against the resolution because it contains too much wishful thinking .
the sustainable future of humanity is at issue here .
there is simply no alternative to collective action on this issue .
parliament reiterates it aim of increasing this reduction to 30 % .
it is important that lesson should be drawn from the failure in copenhagen .
i hope that mexico will have a successful outcome .
unfortunately , a number of good amendment were rejected .
apart from any environmental romanticism , we must not forget european industry .
a ccctb is not about a common tax rate .
taxation of company is the exclusive responsibility of each member state .
we will not be used a a moral alibi for such a policy .
there are much more efficient way of combating the issue of double taxation .
and for this reason , i will vote in favour of the report .
such a deduction at source should be a final tax .
we believe that measure at national level are more appropriate in this domain .
the main political party are in complete agreement on this issue .
the greater part of society also concurs with this view .
in addition , the religious and moral aspect are an important element .
firstly , the recommendation for paternity leave at european level .
this resolution highlight the commission 's responsibility to legislate in this area .
woman must have control over their sexual and reproductive right .
this is primarily a statement of principle which i am comfortable in supporting .
this report doe not and can not change that position .
in writing . - i strongly support this report .
four time more woman than men across europe work part-time .
the gender pay gap - 17.4 % - ha barely narrowed since 2000 .
the report of marc tarabella clearly emphasis the greatest barrier to gender equality .
i do not even think that this should be difficult to achieve .
let u hope that it will come to be implemented in reality .
we must stand up for the principle of subsidiarity .
many in my electorate in romania would be disappointed if i voted differently .
i remain firm in my commitment to promoting a responsible sexual culture .
there are still effort to be made in this area .
woman must be able to have full physical autonomy .
woman should have control over their sexual and reproductive right .
this is an area where the principle of subsidiarity should be applied .
in my opinion , the current wording would infringe the principle of subsidiarity .
the ecr group have nevertheless voted against this resolution for two specific reason .
however , abortion come solely within the competence of the member state .
i voted in favour of the cite convention report .
human activity are adding to this rate of extinction and are endangering biodiversity .
biological diversity is vital to the wellbeing and survival of humanity .
it aim to prevent the excessive exploitation of these specie for international trade .
these must have supporting data and substantiated scientific opinion .
it therefore meet the criterion for listing in cite appendix i .
the effort made by these fisherman can not fall on their shoulder alone .
a for spain and malta , their display of silence is reprehensible .
such industrial and international fishing threatens traditional coastal fishing in the mediterranean .
within the eu , national legislation varies from one member state to another .
the union shall also stand up to the other party to cite .
that is why i voted in favour of this resolution .
i voted in favour of adopting the 2009 progress report on croatia .
these amendment encourage croatia to continue it effort to promote cultural diversity .
this hold true for croatia and any other potential candidate country .
i know that croatia can live up to it aspiration .
we hope that negotiation can be concluded within this year .
for our part , croatia can count on our complete support .
the people of croatia do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
this is very important for stabilisation in the region .
the resolution on croatia is a political resolution with no legal binding force .
without the balkan war , it would have joined in 2004 .
the eu introduced a visa-free regime with this state .
this in particular foster the development of people-to-people contact .
it is increasingly destructive of freedom of speech , writing and even thought .
i voted in favour of adopting turkey 's progress report 2009 .
it is our partner in nato and deserves to be treated a such .
the people of turkey do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
most of turkey is not geographically part of europe .
the secularity of the country is only held in place by military force .
turkey must understand that it can not change it past .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
our parliament is composed of member directly elected by the citizen of europe .
therefore , finding the right middle ground , here , wa important .
on 21 december , i sent another letter to mr reinfeldt .
the measure we have taken will also be helped by our discussion today .
that is why this discussion about swift is so important .
this can not be rectified ex post by mechanism of oversight and control .
however , we can not keep falling for fake promise of jam tomorrow .
the council fails to clarify the precise role of the public authority .
this is an objective that the treaty of lisbon entrusts largely to parliament .
a global approach is therefore needed to eradicate it .
data exchange without an agreement ha worked uninterruptedly for many year .
these are just some of the example judge bruguière cite in his report .
it ha allowed u to investigate and prevent attack .
that had to be done in a very short space of time .
we now know that the commitment i have just set out is possible .
there are specific example and the council referred to a few of them .
that mean that the data held on the tftp database are effectively anonymous .
finally , the interim agreement is only an interim agreement .
it might not be the best agreement in the world .
it can - and it will - be improved .
the european parliament will be fully informed at all stage of this procedure .
i hope that this answer a few of your question .
thank you , mr malmström , for your explanation .
they were , truly , very important for u .
however , we know we are responsible to our citizen .
we are directly elected member of the european parliament .
however , gulliver believed that he had arrived in the land of giant .
the serious problem regarding data protection have already been referred to .
all of these factor represent serious failing in this agreement .
if you can do this , we will support the new agreement .
this evening , i will suggest that my group vote against this agreement .
i do not consider that the second bruguière report is sufficient .
i am grateful to the american for taking part in this far-reaching dialogue .
the council ha not done this task justice in the past .
parliament must not evade it responsibility again a it did in november .
parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool .
we have big brother 's little sister waiting for our approval .
why should google be able to set data threshold in future ?
it is all for the swift agreement and tomorrow will vote in favour .
mr president , in your introduction you mentioned responsibility .
this is not a sectarian issue for u but a factual issue .
the united state administration tell u that is not the case .
there is no proof of what you say in this statement .
you mentioned the negotiating guideline that you are nearly done with .
these attempt to threaten u can be described in one word : ridiculous .
there are many agreement and measure in place to combat terrorism .
the idea is to divert attention away from this fact .
therefore , we must find a balance between security and privacy .
this balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating .
in this case , this question is easy to answer .
therefore , i am in favour of voting against this agreement tomorrow .
if terrorist can hide among ordinary people , security is reduced .
instead i call for a complete review of all these anti-terrorism law .
i do not believe that this will change anything .
there have been many failed or bad investigation in the european union .
the interim agreement that wa negotiated lack data protection .
there is a lack of reciprocity and a lack of proportionality .
we certainly hope that the final agreement will be properly negotiated .
i would like to make three comment regarding the issue itself .
i would like to make two more point on this matter .
the perpetrator of these attack are all currently serving sentence in spanish prison .
the agreement under debate today is probably not perfect .
the council is making a commitment to do this .
the council can not ignore this afternoon 's debate .
the permanent agreement will also include guarantee of rectification , access to information .
mr lambrinidis asked why the commission doe not have that .
( de ) mr president , that is very helpful .
it is very hard for parliament to accept an unconditional assurance .
mr rubalcaba , you have put your finger on it .
i have great respect for everything that ha been said .
in her letter , mr hennis-plasschaert asks the same question a manfred weber .
in my opinion , we are capable of achieving this .
rapporteur . - mr president , a lot ha been said .
i said this before and i want to hear it again clearly .
in that respect , parliament and the council are not in tune yet .
the vote will take place on thursday , 10 february 2010 .
we very much hope they will seize this opportunity .
when we are talking about security , political game should be set aside .
this brings u to the debate on information management .
our recently adopted strategy formed part of the council 's conclusion last november .
these matter are debated in the formal and informal council of transport minister .
these consideration must be taken into account in our next debate .
my priority a transport commissioner is definitely the safety and security of passenger .
to my mind , an eu framework would be better .
i look forward to your view and thank you for your attention .
this , of course , is a commitment that it still valid .
we will also have to revise how we use our financial resource .
what will we be faced with over the next few year ?
in this respect , i have three specific request or proposal .
the first concern cooperation among the authority in europe .
these are wonderful word , but nothing ha happened in practice .
once again nothing happened in toledo with regard to practical cooperation .
what we are lacking is cooperation between the authority .
thirdly , we have just had a discussion about swift .
first of all , we must take a coordinated , harmonised european approach .
the event in detroit and munich have shown that there are security loophole .
this is one of the crucial question that we must ask ourselves .
finally , can we ensure that the data is being protected ?
if we are going to install them , who will be paying ?
you also want to do this and present u with a solution .
whatever happens , we need a solution which cover the whole of europe .
we need to search for the bomber and not the bomb .
the latest generation of scanner satisfy the requirement that parliament ha laid down .
the latest scanner also do not have any effect on health .
the radiation they give off is le than that from mobile phone .
what is more , the scanner are also user-friendly .
that will therefore also make a difference to cost for air traveller .
however , mr president , the latest scanner are additional security tool .
profiling and good intelligence exchange are also very much required .
it did not , unless it refers to the era of sheer effrontery .
european citizen also need to know that we in parliament have a responsibility .
yes , we do indeed need to investigate terrorism .
i am sorry to say that these are incorrect .
now we find ourselves debating the database and police practice of the future .
can there be any greater mockery of human right ?
i would like to say one thing first of all .
of course , it is obvious that personal right must be protected .
may i quote the only one who is not here .
in comparison , 6 000 people die of aid every day .
we should anticipate event , but we do not .
we can not wait any longer because the terrorist are not waiting .
the first is cosi , the standing committee on internal security .
do the u intelligence service keep their european counterpart up to date ?
a parliamentary supervisory body on the matter is urgently required .
this entail the creation of a parliamentary supervisory committee within the european parliament .
it seems that no one is willing to deal with the subject .
we talk here about the cooperation of the security force .
believe me , terrorism destroys life and shatters community .
i have even heard in this chamber today that terrorism is hysteria .
i ask that they conclude them promptly and refer them to parliament .
secondly , is it or is it not harmful to health ?
initially we were told that it would be optional .
sinn féin/ira now hold post in the government of northern ireland .
no greater example of successful terrorism exists than that .
no doubt future terrorist will find this all extremely encouraging .
some government have legitimately started to test body scanner on more sensitive route .
lady and gentleman , we now come to catch-the-eye .
i will simply stop the microphone after one minute .
i shall call the speaker in the order that i have :
use of this type of equipment still leaf a series of unanswered question .
how will protection of the image of people who are scanned be guaranteed ?
the public are le aware of the effect of terahertz radiation .
this is perhaps the story of various suicide attacker .
instead , i argue we should bring on israeli-style profiling of passenger .
we do not currently have any clear answer to this question .
i would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else .
i would have to do so at least twice a week .
no real assessment have been carried out in this area .
therefore , i am calling for clear answer and not for hasty reaction .
we have heard some extremely interesting view , and i welcome them .
we are also keen to ensure the correct exchange of information .
this ha been emphasised in the house on various occasion .
that is the information that need to be transmitted .
there have been significant improvement recently in the european union in that regard .
i believe these are the three topic that we need to examine .
so this is what we will do in the near future .
we will come with a report and then we will continue this discussion .
i agree with certain member who have said that .
we will also have to give full consideration to respect for fundamental right .
thank you very much for an important and very engaging debate .
terrorism remains a high-level threat in the european union .
the use of body scanner is a delicate issue .
i have always taken the stand that it is a question of priority .
civil liberty group have the duty to weigh all new measure being advocated .
it ha been established that body scanner are more effective .
the problem is that they may offend passenger ' dignity .
therefore , this is the issue which ha to be addressed .
they have condemned the deportation of a an intolerable violation of press freedom .
this is why these issue should be investigated in their overall context .
the information we are receiving about this make u very sceptical .
this system ha proved it effectiveness over many year .
i totally agree with finding viable solution for enhancing our citizen ' security .
and when you dare to protest , they laugh in your face .
a decision on compulsory use of scanning equipment must be made .
for it is difficult to suppose that terrorist will agree to being scanned .
the statement issued by the high representative on monday expressed this sentiment .
the high turnout on both election day wa particularly encouraging .
it is clear that ukraine 's democracy is continuing it process of consolidation .
most importantly , it demonstrates ukraine 's attachment to european value .
preliminary election result show a very small gap between the two contestant .
we have already heard about possible challenge to the result in the court .
it is logical and legitimate that any possible problem are investigated .
it is also an opportunity for a new start .
it is now vital for ukraine to move forward .
much more should have been done in the past year .
the weakness of ukraine 's constitutional framework ha also contributed to this .
this is also a precondition for the disbursement of possible eu macrofinancial assistance .
reform is essential for ukraine 's own long-term prosperity and security .
it is up to ukraine to choose the model it want to adopt .
but our offer to ukraine is not a one-way street .
madam president , commissioner , we are rather disappointed .
he is certainly responsible for the failure of the orange revolution .
i hope that these election will bring new stability to ukraine .
instead , it cause u to watch ukraine with great concern .
mr füle , you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy .
however , neighbourhood policy doe not simply mean going on a before .
there is a saying that a revolution devours it own child .
this is true , but ukraine remains a state even after these election .
none of the citizen whom i met had great expectation of this election .
the internal failing in ukraine are mirrored by failing in the european strategy .
gas is one subject which always cause a great deal of consternation .
we can not simply let thing go on a they have before .
you have taken on a significant responsibility in this area .
given the close result , both camp will have to make compromise .
however , this is good - this is how it should be .
can far-reaching reform be carried out in a post-communist country without that promise ?
not today , not tomorrow , but there will be room .
this will be of great help to the ukrainian .
it is an opportunity for you , too , mr füle .
say this clearly , and you will go down in history .
someone must , at last , after these five year , say it .
the european union must respond with clear signal welcoming both trend .
at the same time , ukraine need to speed up it reform .
after the election in ukraine , something will change .
a new openness to ukraine is needed from the european union .
ukraine is going to be a partner from whom much will be expected .
ukraine is going to be a partner who should be treated with goodwill .
the eastern partnership and euronest initiative offer a suitable framework for this .
the question is whether the ukraine can consolidate democracy internally .
this mean establishing democratic norm and protecting human right .
this is not solely the fault of their political elite .
many reform were never implemented , and many never left the drawing board .
it suggests that there are unworthy and undesirable intention behind it .
however , we should say something to the european union .
the european union must give ukraine an alternative european vision .
ukraine is still deciding which model of civilisation it should subscribe to .
should the country cooperate with the east or choose integration in europe ?
( sl ) commissioner , your report on ukraine today wa very clear .
basically , the close contest ha exposed how complicated this country is .
it is encouraging that this wa the result of a fair election .
otherwise , the result of the next election will already have been decided .
the eu must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process .
i am sure it is a subject to which we will return again .
a i said at the beginning , ukraine matter .
eu-ukraine relation have deepened considerably in the past year .
i firmly believe that this dynamic should continue in the future .
the vote will take place during the second part-session in february .
more than half a million ethnic romanian live in this country .
another group of citizen look at european integration with distrust .
furthermore , effort aimed at expanding storage capacity are also worth supporting .
now we need to make maximum use of the eastern partnership .
europe should consider making a specific proposal to include ukraine in european structure .
ukraine is a european state and share all of europe 's cultural value .
i am pleased that the ukrainian election last sunday passed off well .
i am sorry that yulia tymoshenko lost the election .
the next item is question time ( b7-0006/2010 ) .
the member state concerned should also act a one on this matter .
an internal energy market need better interconnection between national power network .
the baltic state have been hit very hard by the economic crisis .
a lot done ; a lot more to do .
'religious belief ' is guaranteed , but what about practice ?
( de ) thank you for your accurate answer , mr garrido .
however , i would like to ask for some even more detailed information .
( pt ) madam president , minister , thank you for your response .
we will continue to act and develop along these line .
three year ago , a special parliamentary commission wa appointed on guantánamo .
i agree with the point made by the last speaker .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00 )
effect of the economic crisis on world trade ( debate )
keeping international trade flowing is vital for the eu and other exports-oriented country .
by and large , only a few country resorted to trade protectionism .
in order to maintain this , it is important to remain extremely vigilant .
external source of growth will be crucial to eu economic recovery .
this will be a priority for me a trade commissioner .
but trade policy is about more than just competitiveness and growth .
i think it is important to stop and reflect on why that wa .
i would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over .
that would amount to considered action and leadership on our part .
we in parliament need to reflect on that too .
property and tourism are sector which have been particularly affected by this .
i am counting exclusively on this europe 2020 strategy to find these answer .
now , i almost want to reverse the issue .
this can be seen clearly in the current situation .
i think the present crisis will be a test for all of u .
we must also use our strength - advanced technology and human capital .
that , concretely , is the prescription of the commission .
last year , the uk economy contracted 4.8 % .
the german economy contracted 5 % and eu trade much more so .
so what ha the eu done to bring this about ?
however , this would incur a much higher social cost .
if you believe the commission , trade dropped by 10 % in 2009 .
if you believe the imf , it dropped by 12.3 % in 2009 .
( sv ) madam president , our continent is a rich one .
the eu must shoulder a particular responsibility for maintaining free and fair trade .
protectionism is an evil and ha always been an evil .
we should act in a similar way on many other matter .
however , protectionism further hurt international trade and the eu 's interest directly .
many other member have referred to the developing country .
i look forward to hearing your answer , mr de gucht .
how doe the u rate the importance of these relation ?
is it good for the environment that good are delivered from great distance ?
a new theory came into being - they were too big to fail .
i have only two or three minute if i understand rightly .
having said this , let me start with a general remark .
i really do not believe that protectionism is a solution .
that brings me to the origin of the crisis we are going through .
so what we should do is become stronger ourselves .
there wa also the question by david martin on the robin hood tax .
being a member state of the european union also implies some obligation .
this is the point at which we must start .
eu - south korea free trade agreement ( debate )
however , the main protest are coming from the car industry .
we all welcomed the birth of the new europe in lisbon with hope .
this is the scenario in which our major business are forced to operate .
free and fair trade form the basis for europe 's prosperity .
this may lead to one-sided cost benefit for south korean industry .
i know from discussion with company what an important impact the implementation ha .
in our opinion , at least , this should be included .
the commission ha assured u that korea is actively liberalising it import regime .
what evidence doe the commission have to support this argument ?
throughout the negotiating process , the commission remained in close contact with parliament .
the objective is to sign the agreement in april .
the economic benefit of the fta are mostly in the eu 's favour .
obviously , the fta also open the eu market to korean product .
thus , maintaining it in the fta doe not accrue any new benefit .
the scope of these commitment is broader than that of any comparable agreement .
just take a look at the figure , commissioner .
the number and the trend are much too alarming .
and they are not , a one of my colleague indicated , insignificant .
we asked a a parliament for improved social and environmental standard .
is it a good deal , potentially , for the world economy ?
these two principle will soon constitute a precedent for our other trade partner .
mr president , a you said , this agreement break new ground .
in this case , we see that the opposite is true .
you have talked about the lisbon strategy , the green economy and innovation .
i do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged .
i know there are concern and i have listened to those concern .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industry .
these complaint give rise to question that continue to go unanswered .
what defence mechanism and safeguard are there against aggressive export ?
commissioner , fair economic relation must be established a a matter of urgency .
i actually welcome the free trade agreement with south korea .
south korea is an important ally in a strategically important area .
consequently , china is also the country 's main trade competitor .
this is a template . we need to do it right .
there must be a level playing field for both party .
we did not think that event would prove u right so quickly .
also , the european trade union federation ha criticised this free trade agreement .
we must not be pressurised into acting too quickly .
therefore , it is my conviction that we should act a follows .
what is the reason for this two-year time lapse commissioner ?
the case of opel in antwerp ha been mentioned several time .
you have referred to the situation with opel in antwerp .
my first question concern the need for fair competition condition .
it is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clause .
i would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when .
this includes approving safeguard clause and implementation a part of the codecision process .
many people have already spoken about the automotive sector .
i believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreement .
is it a qualified majority or a majority by consensus ?
the agreement with south korea wa only concluded afterwards .
the risk of infection following an accident are not insignificant .
liz ha outlined some of the background to it .
we took a while to persuade him to act .
it is no coincidence that all are the same in this respect .
liz ha mentioned the trauma that people affected by needle-stick injury face .
that is another area that we need to think about for the future .
i am aware that this is a long-standing concern of this house .
a you know , the commission proposal aim to implement this agreement .
essentially , million of european will be better protected by this instrument .
perhaps i can briefly explain why the socialist meps are very pleased today .
i feel that today is a day to mention a few thing .
firstly , the importance of health and safety in the workplace .
what is the price paid for a lack of social security ?
secondly , the importance of prevention , a prevention is better than cure .
action must be taken before incident occur so a to prevent them .
we do not want any more needle-stick injury unnecessarily during that waiting time .
we have had too many over the last few year .
i think it is very important that prison officer are protected a well .
but i think we also need to ask why people are not reporting .
people have spoken about the scope of this action .
i should like to thank mr lynne for all her work .
the day spent waiting for the result were extremely difficult .
we need to focus on the worker , the european people need that .
i myself have been pricked by potentially infectious needle and instrument .
the resolution , in my opinion , is fully deserving of support .
indeed , the financial aspect is not insignificant , either .
sometimes we say that europe need to get closer to it citizen .
with this debate , we have certainly managed to do so .
that is why prevention , healthcare and job security are essential .
i am sure we are all grateful to the initiator of this debate .
online gambling in relation to recent ecj ruling ( debate )
commissioner , we are very pleased to have you here .
commissioner , that is the context of this question .
how can we best protect the interest of our citizen and consumer ?
how can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity ?
how can we best protect our citizen from harm ?
it is best to leave this to the competence of national administration .
market surveillance is also key , when it come to online gambling .
this is not the open europe or the transparent europe that i want .
with a new commission we do hope for new impetus .
i have great faith in you , commissioner barnier .
for young people , in particular , it constitutes a real threat .
in my opinion , online gambling should be curbed a much a possible .
that also implies open access to the internet for child and young people .
who creates the legislative framework , who creates the rule for such business ?
it increase the risk of addiction , especially for young people .
here we have a good opportunity to demonstrate this in practice .
let me start by saying that i support the initiative that you mentioned .
however , i would also like to remind you of the political reality .
i would have liked to have heard a somewhat clearer answer , however .
is that the line you want to take or not ?
member state should not be facilitating any market that promote social misery .
unfortunately , many people can not resist the lure of gambling .
a previous speaker have said , gambling is not like any normal service .
there are two internationally recognised scale which can measure problem gambling .
what would this number be across the european union ?
i look forward to hearing further from commissioner barnier .
mr president , i want to add my congratulation to commissioner barnier .
he enjoyed race-going and obviously wa a man to place a bet .
clearly there are two school of thought on this issue .
whether we like it or not , people enjoy gambling .
we need strict rule , regulation of the market and public agency monitoring .
the loneliness and the basic invisibility of gambler characterise a generally unacceptable addiction .
gambling is a vice that appears still today to be largely hidden .
on the other hand , we can not abandon our sense of responsibility .
nor do we have any clear definition , either .
a pure internal market approach will not get u anywhere with these issue .
the member state and the various operator are all involved .
it must do so by showing the necessary determination .
the council and parliament have been working hand in hand for year .
we should inform consumer of the possible negative consequence of online gambling .
we need to identify the risk of gambling addiction developing in young people .
i would say more that i am against this activity .
we must ensure that online gambling is handled in a responsible manner .
we must protect minor and those who are vulnerable .
we must also prevent addiction and avoid organised crime .
in my opinion , regulation should focus on consumer protection issue .
last but not least , allow me to make two proposal .
we need a common policy because gambling transgresses border .
so we are talking about action and we are talking about the timetable .
in the fourteen year since 1996 the gambling market ha grown dramatically .
portugal had banned company from providing game of chance on the internet .
addiction to gambling is a major problem right now .
one study ha found that people start gambling a early a 13 .
nor will we eliminate money laundering or other associated criminal activity .
if need be , they can be banned from playing .
protecting young people is another problem related to this issue .
however , banning young people from gambling will not get u anywhere .
of course , i have been in office for 48 hour .
it is this , therefore , that is going to change .
one of these question , one of these challenge , is cross-border crime .
thank you very much , commissioner , for that full and encouraging reply .
this give rise to serious consequence , not only legal but also financial .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.25 and resumed at 12.00 )
international recovery of child support and other form of family maintenance (
community programme for employment and social solidarity - progress (
we will have a very important crisis management tool in our hand .
we truly hope that it will be a success .
that would enable u to reach a definitive opinion in march .
the commission is committed to a very ambitious timetable .
( parliament rejected the request to refer back to committee the report )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on venezuela .
it certainly includes the right to receive information from multiple pluralistic source .
recently there have been attack on medium freedom by president hugo chávez .
i will resume because there is no point in wasting time .
four national station have failed to comply with their statutory registration requirement .
if you want to make fool of yourselves today , be my guest .
mr president , i also have two problem regarding venezuela .
one is of form and the other is of substance .
there are many flagrant case of violation of human right in latin america .
do we want to discus human right in latin america ?
no , i am not without some sharp criticism of the venezuelan government .
there is a trend towards bureaucratism in certain sens .
this diagnosis is also true , today , for venezuela .
medium freedom are of essential significance for democracy and respect for fundamental value .
i voted in favour of the initiative on italy .
much diplomatic skill and sensitivity is required for this task .
i hope that the european union is in a position to do that .
i doubt that they constitute a majority in this house .
this movement wa fuelled by citizen using technology a a vehicle .
he is nothing short of a dictator because he hate pluralism .
i therefore believe that socialist should not defend him .
one of the victim of the recent demonstration wa actually a socialist student .
we are , certainly , seeing disturbing event in venezuela .
we are talking about right , plurality and freedom .
unfortunately , certain people do not believe in this yet .
you can be assured that the commission is following this situation very closely .
we are closely following with concern the tendency towards political radicalisation .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
control of the medium and of different opinion is typical for totalitarian regime .
a a result , the country 's cable provider stopped broadcasting seven channel .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on madagascar .
mr rajoelina refuse to share power and is removing everyone who opposes him .
mr president , there is consensus on this motion for a resolution .
however , our aim is to bring peace to the region .
that is a it should be , because this topic is very important .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on burma .
mr president , the situation in burma continues to deteriorate .
it awakens hope for the introduction of change and for democratisation .
the burmese regime is a problem we have struggled with for year .
in my opinion , only joint action can bring result .
the last democratically elected member of parliament were elected in 1990 .
they have all been arrested or forced to resign .
ten of thousand of people have been displaced against their will .
in this sort of situation , journalist are especially at risk .
we can not but be sceptical a to the outcome .
she ha consistently been denied a voice , a have her supporter .
in some case they simply hope to live another day .
it is true that there ha been some change .
in this regard , i must make an explicit appeal to the commission .
we are talking about hundred of thousand of people who require our help .
the opposition party are rightly going to boycott them .
many have fled to neighbouring bangladesh and have been brutally persecuted en route .
last year , karen refugee fleeing the repression took refuge in thailand .
in our resolution we have raised just a few issue .
this may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflict .
the current trend is to arrest people for expressing political view .
the eu ha several time issued declaration condemning violation of human right .
in addition , the eu ha strongly supported the united nation effort .
assistance also go to the refugee camp along the thai border .
we back the special united nation rapporteur and are ready to help him .
therefore , human right are built into all our assistance programme .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
the next item on the agenda is the vote .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
we welcome you and congratulate you once again , mr president .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
transportation of horse for slaughter in the european union ( written declaration )
we would like to thank the author for submitting this declaration .
we did not finish discussing this in the group .
there are different approach in our group - i freely admit this .
i should make it clear that this compromise is ready for approval .
( de ) mr president , i would like to reiterate my request .
there is no doubt that we are in favour of debate .
we are merely asking for the vote to be postponed .
mr lehne , i can not give you any assurance about the result .
( de ) mr president , i will be brief .
i do not wish to go into the question of merit just now .
perhaps 15 to 20 minute will be enough for you ?
there wa little opportunity to develop a long-term strategy .
greater continuity is fundamental to building relationship and carrying out a serious task .
who are our main strategic partner in the world ?
where do we want to be in 10 or 20 year ' time ?
let me just say a few word about the european council itself .
it is therefore a task to which the european council is eminently suited .
i wa glad to find such a level of ambition around the table .
all this ha proved to be an important asset in the crisis .
hoping for a return of the good old day is no option .
but we could never get back what we lost in the crisis .
i believe we can and must be more ambitious .
but this can not be done by half measure and incremental change .
secondly , our strategy must engage all part of our society .
it is also why we have been wise to reform financial market .
it should not be a question of a debate on competence .
what we have to see is the added value of a european approach .
it make no sense to recognise global interdependence and to reject european interdependence .
still , a lot of action will have to come at national level .
we need strong and true coordination in the economic field .
the lisbon treaty give u these instrument and we will use them .
in this european council , i saw awareness of this problem .
a question for you there , president van rompuy .
consolidation can not be achieved through tax rise alone .
european deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach .
it is important to determine what exactly happened in greece .
i think there is only one good solution to that .
we need a bolder instrument inside the european union .
this bolder instrument is economic governance inside the european union .
i would like to pick up on an issue raised by mr verhofstadt .
secondly , a lot need to change in greece , too .
there is the excessive public sector , for example .
i would just like to say one sentence about the eu 2020 strategy .
we now need to set a new course for our economy .
only competitive business and successful entrepreneur can do that .
the internal market need to be reinvigorated and extended to new field .
the bank have already made more progress than the state .
believe me , i find no pleasure in using negative example from germany .
who will have to find this money , though ?
the same work in the same place must receive the same wage .
well , i am afraid what we got wa you .
and i am sorry , but after that performance that you gave earlier ...
mr chair , will you take a blue card question ?
mr president , i am very disappointed in you , mr buzek .
you may not like what i say , but just consider your behaviour .
we have been called mentally weak by danny cohn-bendit .
mr farage , i am sorry but it wa not a personal statement .
we must keep order and all the regulation of our parliament .
however , let u not get too worked up about that .
i should like to congratulate you on this in advance .
they centre on a green , social , market economy .
the 2020 strategy must be built on such a foundation .
that is indecent and it is also an obstacle to all other development .
it would be a mild punishment for the behaviour he ha exhibited .
however , we need resource if this is to succeed .
we have had enough of that here today in parliament .
remember , what is true for citizen is also true for government .
ambitious , firstly , a regard the reduction of our ecological footprint .
however , we will not achieve these result without two absolutely vital ingredient .
an eu 2020 strategy focused on innovation in area of existing expertise ...
( remainder of speech not available for technical reason )
moreover , the commission wa not courageous enough , mr barroso .
they have their own dynamism , and we need to respond to this .
that is the task that this strategy must allow u to fulfil .
for this , new framework condition need to be defined .
we need to think carefully about the climate objective of the past .
firstly , that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically .
to achieve goal in public policy , a budget is needed .
therefore , we are le able to revive our growth .
is it a simple name change or a change of direction ?
( de ) madam president , it is easy to set fine goal .
that is what we need to see for the europe 2020 agenda .
the european union should not , a a general rule , employ despotism .
europe 2020 must not trigger another competition marathon and privatisation exodus .
instead , it must guarantee the prosperity of the citizen of europe .
( e ) ( beginning of speech not available for technical reason ) ...
we should be looking at 40 % by 2020 .
it should not be the goal of a strategy .
you said very clearly that the market is not enough .
yes indeed , we want a social market economy .
there are three thing i would like to see .
european economic governance ha been called for in many different way by parliament .
reform also need to be made in the country that have excessive surplus .
mr van rompuy , the european union walk on two leg .
we are looking for the head , and you are the head !
thank you for being here , mr van rompuy .
i am going to highlight one objective : the internal market .
the european internal market wa conceived more than 20 year ago .
firstly , do we already have a europe 2020 strategy that promise success ?
private sector demand is a long way from recovery .
we need a european monetary fund , a fund to help these country .
i say this also a a member from a previously communist country .
that must be the starting point for all new strategy .
we know very little about that at this point .
through cohesion , the eu 's competitiveness will grow a well .
thirdly , let u tailor the strategy to the country .
that is what will lend credibility to the whole thing .
we must not bury our head in the sand .
these are worker who must be safeguarded and protected .
before we focus on new job , we must protect the existing one .
there are other country a well , a we all know .
moreover , our country ha never asked for financial support .
what it ha asked for and is asking for is political support .
without your support , the eu 2020 can not and will not succeed .
we have drawn consequence and learnt lesson from the crisis of the 1930s .
the crisis actually lasted until the end of the decade .
therefore , we have protected our internal market , which is not perfect .
however , we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s .
there are also some very positive thing that have been produced .
now we must leave this strategy , this so-called exit strategy , behind .
that mean that some budgetary choice will need to be made .
it so happens that they could be hard goal .
it is not just the european union that will implement reform .
it is often said that we need more binding measure .
i believe that we have sent out the right message .
if necessary , there is , of course , an element of solidarity .
thank you so much for being here with u .
it is actually the economic model which need to change .
we can not have a dynamic economy unless we have motivated worker .
at the same time , we must make up for our neglect .
we need a new approach to these new challenge .
support , especially for small and medium-sized enterprise , is a significant matter .
the eu 2020 strategy must stand on two pillar .
eu 2020 must clearly mark the start of the post-lisbon phase .
there are three priority area which must feature in eu 2020 without fail .
this approach will guarantee a healthy economic environment for private entity .
this process will ensure a better employment level in member state .
finally , the european parliament must have an increased role .
finally , i would like to discus the problem of the council review .
the only possibility is to blame the entire international community .
clearly , therefore , this body ha little substantive moral authority .
secondly , this resolution make reference to the cia and extraordinary rendition .
however , it should take a critical look at itself .
therefore , my electorate awaits self-determination , along with the kashmiri .
military action by both side have meant that mainly civilian suffer , unfortunately .
i would like to refer to two other parliamentary priority .
i would like today to stress mr milinkevich 's message .
on the other hand , israel respect the right of prisoner .
the iranian regime asserted that respect for human right is guaranteed there .
my parliamentary colleague provided several eyewitness account during the january part-session .
it is about showing that we side with liberty , not with oppression .
many european union member prosecute and imprison people for non-violent freedom of speech .
a you know , declaration have constantly been made on this subject .
we will make sure that we share these with the high representative .
let me make four point in response to specific question and comment .
i have many reservation about the unhcr 's overall credibility .
this investigation should be in accordance with international standard .
this report is intended to deal solely with the occupied territory .
we ought to bear this in mind when evaluating this matter .
a population wa thrown into panic , trapped and unable to escape .
this parliament will not allow itself to be intimidated .
mr president , the goldstone report is exceptionally unbalanced and unfair .
it attempt , in fact , to absolve the terrorist activity of hamas .
every country ha the right to defend itself against terrorist .
when have we ever seen hamas investigate it own action ?
look at all the precaution they took during the operation .
we should not waste any more time on it .
put an end to this political persecution of the state of israel .
so let u not try to rubbish this report .
for that reason , we call for an investigation and for atonement .
this certainly hold true for the conflict in the middle east .
i have heard a lot of criticism here about mr goldstone 's report .
this is why the report ha simply been ignored .
how can a state defend it citizen in such a situation ?
if so , is it possible to avoid civilian becoming victim ?
what did the international community do to prevent this form of terrorism ?
the truth is that violence remains a disastrous policy .
why doe it allow impunity to reign in this region ?
mr president , i will conclude on a positive note .
the goldstone report make many accusation and they have to be investigated .
even israeli soldier have testified that they received order to shoot at civilian .
it is that simple ; it just need to be applied .
the answer to all three question is judge goldstone .
it is certainly not the one i have read .
that is the first step we should be taking .
while it make far-reaching demand of israel , it say little about hamas .
the policy of treating both side on equal term is not helping .
it doe not give israel an alibi for engaging in such criminal act .
we are allowing the law of might is right to prevail .
over 1 400 victim in the gaza strip are obviously too many .
hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attack on israel .
it perhaps doe not help any further , either .
the european union must protect israel from it own demon .
goldstone is a respected judge of considerable repute , and jewish .
there need to be an independent investigation into alleged breach of human right .
rather that ha been the ira and their political representative .
it is also going to be debated in the human right council .
he eye-witnessed violation on both side and he spoke up against those .
the vote will take place during the next sitting .
justice goldstone did not show sufficient care when examining the evidence .
reliance on the report of justice goldstone alone will not contribute to this .
situation of civil society and national minority in belarus ( debate )
belarus is in the neighbourhood of the european union .
i think this message must be made clear to the regime .
this is in a european country in the 21st century .
the second question is how we can achieve this .
we have seen that mr yanukovich ha been elected in ukraine .
we should be concerned about the human right situation in belarus .
mr president , a lack of a decision is also a decision .
a we hear today , these were mostly elderly people .
this issue can not be considered a polish-belarusian internal affair .
this is , indeed , a very good example of our european standard .
this is not a polish-belarusian or a belarusian-polish conflict .
i would like to ask what we should do .
are charge for visa and a visa policy necessary at all ?
today , we had another opportunity to show that the union can act .
this is a defeat which ha affected the union 's credibility .
the european union is , today , a weak and undecided player .
she used this money to renovate a ruined building in the town centre .
this is not a pace of adopting international standard .
therefore , i would like to say one more thing .
we can talk about sanction , and the time will come for this .
harassment of national minority is part of the political practice in undemocratic regime .
what commissioner georgieva said to u about 'people-to-people contact ' is important .
in my case , it led me to the london school of economics .
the vote will take place during the next monthly session .
every manifestation of independence is treated a political opposition .
beijing +15 - un platform for action for gender equality ( debate )
the next item is the debate on the following :
the platform for action adopted wa the first global document of it type .
it took an overall view of woman 's condition and right .
the universal declaration comprises 30 article and they are often cited .
i entirely agree with the ppe group that paragraph 9 is central .
no other wording ha been proposed to replace paragraph 9 .
i am talking very specifically about the europe 2020 strategy .
we will both take the floor during the plenary session .
i think that this , too , is a very strong symbol .
the 15th anniversary of the beijing platform for action .
both president have just expressed their opinion on europe 2020 .
we therefore have no other choice in the matter .
we are on our way , with the goal firmly in view .
there is an old german saying : many road lead to rome .
this requires sensitivity and it requires the power of persuasion .
in her resolution , mr svensson ha touched many open wound .
however , despite this consensus , the sequel is le stirring .
i do not think that human right can be subject to compromise .
we must not put up with the lowest common denominator .
we are still far from beijing 's strategic objective .
here in europe we still have a lot to address .
minority woman are experiencing poverty , exclusion and discrimination .
their need are largely unknown and ignored and their voice are not heard .
infant mortality is three to four time greater than the majority population .
the fact is , woman form the majority in both category .
what we really need to do is empower woman .
yet i would rather talk about that which is our task .
we have one tool in our hand , and that is lawmaking .
this represented a significant step forward towards bringing about equal opportunity .
often the situation change very little after the law come into force .
it is evident that not everything can be solved by legislative mean .
( pt ) i very much enjoyed listening to you .
you have given u positive message and confirmed your willingness to act .
discrimination in access to education and health care continue to exist .
to this day , inequality between men and woman persist in many area .
rather , we must reconsider the measure put in place to achieve them .
our strategy must consider the short , medium and long term .
these indicator must be concentrated on economic , social and environmental aspect .
mr president , i thank colleague for their contribution to this debate .
there are two other issue which i want to mention .
lastly , let u acknowledge the woman of iran .
skill must be the key criterion , not gender .
where is the europe of human right when we need it ?
gender equality doe not only benefit woman ; it also benefit men .
only yesterday , we had a meeting with the commission in madrid .
that will be the subject of the new york meeting .
i make a call to all the men in this parliament .
please join your voice to the voice of the woman .
the perpetrator of these act must be severely punished .
therefore , i would like to express my esteem for the un initiative .
unfortunately , those observation could be made again , today .
one form of discrimination is violation of the reproductive right of woman .
the resolution doe not reflect the whole beijing platform for action .
is it not time to tackle other obstacle a well ?
this resolution sends out a biased signal that divide rather than unites .
the agreement is due to be submitted to the romanian parliament for approval .
it is my belief that the european union will welcome this major agreement .
a court ha ordered the removal of bilingual street name .
court enforcement officer are being sent to enforce this order .
the electoral right of their parent are being restricted .
the future of the union is currently in the balance .
which direction the union go in depends , in part , on u .
the republic of moldova share the european union 's value .
it is time for an elementary and civilised response .
mr president , we will get over this confusion eventually .
we must put an end to the massacre of stray dog in romania .
anyone who doe not love animal doe not love people either .
the original spelling of foreign name can not be used in identity document .
i would urge the commission not to ignore this important area .
the figure for young people is more than 21 % .
the commission doe , however , have a new mandate to negotiate .
monthly data on the level of unemployment in the union is increasingly depressing .
there are currently over 23 million people in europe who are without work .
an exceptionally detrimental phenomenon is the continually rising number of unemployed young people .
currently , one in five young european is now without work .
there are certain principle and the first principle is the principle of transparency .
this is what i explained before , mr tremopoulos .
we had three request to speak from your group .
all of those member had spoken in the previous sitting .
we therefore used this criterion to distribute the speech equally .
is it possible to have an answer to this question right now ?
we have given the floor to six member of your group .
we have waited here tonight for many hour to speak .
i say to you take it back to mr barroso .
every one of u come here to voice the demand of our electorate .
lady and gentleman , the situation is very clear .
we will do this willingly and do the best that we can .
the assessment of the situation by sakharov prize winner milinkevich is pessimistic .
a he told u , the human right situation ha not improved .
major natural disaster in the autonomous region of madeira ( debate )
however , the regional and national emergency service have it under control .
it doe not currently require support from the european civil protection mechanism .
the structural fund are not available for immediate emergency measure .
it is feared that the number of victim could increase .
however , it is now necessary to look forward .
expression of solidarity have come from all four corner of the globe .
financial resource and the required swiftness of operation are necessary for this purpose .
the european union must provide support in this situation .
let me emphasise that the existing solidarity fund continues to have well-known limitation .
i also call for immediate support for the victim in madeira .
at this time , the prime consideration is the need for swift implementation .
similar mistake were made here to those made in our country .
we received international help when we suffered our major avalanche disaster in galtür .
we must , and will , observe the rule of the fund .
that is the order in which thing need to be done .
cohesion policy is therefore precisely the right instrument to use .
the vote will take place during the march i part session .
this situation requires rapid and effective measure of solidarity from the eu .
investment project in energy infrastructure within the european community ( debate )
europe ha set this priority very high on it agenda .
it is a very important institutional , political and legal point .
we therefore need strong policy and especially a stronger reliable energy policy .
i would also need to be reassured , commissioner oettinger .
thank you for your time and i look forward to hearing your comment .
this is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operator .
this data need to be aggregated at national and regional level .
this help prevent the disclosure of commercially sensitive information .
in my opinion , there are two layer to this proposal .
this is why i hope that amendment 74 will receive majority support tomorrow .
currently , the world us a little over 3 billion m3 .
in 2030 , it will need around 4.3 billion m3 .
and i am worried about duplication in that area .
i learned recently there were 45 different group doing research into salmonella bacteria .
at present , regional cooperation occurs de facto in the energy sector .
however , it need to be reinforced with clear regulation .
solidarity between member state must be translated from an idea into reality .
the commission should carry out regular analysis and research .
in connection with renewable energy in particular , this is an enormous challenge .
on the other hand , we also need to create intelligent network .
just a few word in conclusion - or a my conclusion at least .
and this regulation is not about devising a policy on renewables or gas .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 february 2010 .
measure taken at european level must supplement national and regional strategy .
this is an important tool for shaping a common energy policy .
overall , the report represents progress towards a modern energy mix .
amending budget 1/2010 ( section i , european parliament ) ( debate )
in december , we approved the budget of the european institution for 2010 .
however , this ha given rise to debate concerning the 20 % rule .
my 'yes ' to the amendment to the parliamentary budget is conditional .
this is a good sign that they have confidence in u .
also , how will the extra staff for the secretariat be allocated ?
i think we should have been given that information a well .
in fact , we should be given the global cost for that .
this is going to be a difficult decision for member tomorrow .
it is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resource .
all that would achieve is to mean we would need more building .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 february 2010 .
this budgetary amendment provides a response to a real need .
situation in ukraine ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
green paper on reform of the common fishery policy ( debate )
i would like to highlight two specific issue : first , public funding .
today i am looking forward to hearing your proposal during this debate .
let me also inform you of our next step .
i am sorry that you can not attend this workshop .
this large consultation process will culminate in a very fruitful discussion with you .
i am really looking forward to cooperating with you .
today , however , the european parliament find itself in a different position .
this is important and it is something that the entire sector want .
we need to reduce the overcapacity of certain fleet .
the reform of the fishery policy is more than simply drawing up legislation .
the wording in this regard in the report is good .
who really think that the eu 's discard policy is justifiable ?
another important issue is the regionalisation of the common fishery policy .
these are also issue that we brought up in the alde group report .
finally , i would like to mention the fishery agreement with third country .
i am very happy to see how far the reform ha progressed .
in other word , exploitation wa mandatory for eu member state .
a similar logic is in evidence in the baltic sea .
a radical reform of the fishery policy is needed .
we believe that all type of harmful subsidy must be stopped .
parliament should take a clear stance by rejecting this proposal .
the reality of fishery in the eu is complex and diverse .
this mean involving the fisherman in finding solution and implementing them .
i thought the whole point of quota wa to prevent diminishing stock .
but the problem is how water are being fished , not by whom .
indiscriminate trawling and longline fishing empty our sea of marine life .
it just go to show where the commission 's interest lie .
regretfully , we are not living in this ideal world .
( e ) mr president , everything is at stake in this reform .
the cfp should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fishery product .
today 's vote represents a milestone for the european parliament .
we have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concern into the report .
those affected will now be included in the decision-making process .
support must be given in particular to small family business .
finally , i would like to make one more fundamental point .
fortunately , we have all succeeded in finding effective compromise .
we must leave the trivial problem of national greed to the council .
we must manage fish stock in a sustainable way .
i am particularly concerned about fisherman operating inshore and from small coastal island .
the over-centralised , inflexible cfp ha failed miserably and we must accept that .
i have tabled amendment for which i seek support from colleague .
if we do not get this cfp reform right ...
but to effect that radical change , we must not repeat past mistake .
it must involve the stakeholder in the day-to-day management of stock .
it must ensure fleet capacity brought into line with stock level .
we have to put sustainability and conservation at the heart of our agenda .
yes , we must evolve into a market economy .
indeed , no explicit reference is made to transferable individual right .
a european market that enjoys right to unregulated production is not desirable today .
it would give rise to uncontrollable speculation and a concentration of individual right .
i am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fishery policy .
this further increase the urgency of the need for reform .
i support the drift of the commission 's solution : regionalisation .
current policy go too far , is too detailed and is ineffective .
in addition , compliance with the rule is poor at present .
not that i wish to argue with it ; on the contrary .
there are important lesson to be learned in this regard .
policy must lend itself to implementation , and so simplification is in order .
a regional , sector-specific approach call for nuanced language in this respect .
i shall turn my attention to three point : firstly , overfishing .
from this perspective , i support all of the proposed amendment .
the green paper rightly evaluates current fishery policy , highlighting it many imperfection .
i have always been rather fond of this organisation .
i think this give credibility to the retailer who support the mse .
if we achieve that , we can perhaps do the same for agriculture .
i am certain that we will adopt the report by a large majority .
it is also crucial for external relation and development .
the reform must focus on responsible , sustainable and competitive fishery .
shellfishing activity must be completely integrated into the common fishery policy .
illegal fishing must be stopped - it is very detrimental to law-abiding fisherman .
there must be more stringent and uniform control in the member state .
coastal fishery must be enhanced to give smaller boat a special status .
secondly , stability and predictability for our fishing community and our fisherman .
thirdly , tackling over-capacity ; we must find a solution to over-capacity .
fundamentally it seems to me that the key in term of the cfp ...
it is important that the country with small fishing industry are also represented .
however , we must not only discus the environmental and economic aspect .
many family depend on these fishery for their livelihood .
tourism also play an important role in this respect .
clearly for them , the common fishery policy ha not worked .
and finally , the whole question of research ha to be looked at .
a lot of member state are implementing this system already .
europe ha always taken an interest in the fishery sector .
one of the fundamental mistake of the 2002 reform wa excessive centralisation .
this is something which meet social expectation and need .
bottom trawling is one of the most harmful method .
the eu must take the crisis in fish stock seriously .
railway safety , including the european signalling system ( debate )
it is the responsibility of the belgian investigation body to carry this out .
it should be accomplished independently of any judicial inquiry .
there are even case where different national system coexist in one single country .
the system is known a ertms - european rail traffic management system .
a number of pilot project were carried out between 2000 and 2005 .
since 2005 , several ertms-equipped line have been put into service .
ertms wa created primarily with a view to promoting interoperability .
several question were asked about comparing the situation between member state .
overall data show that the belgian performance is average .
there ha been no lack of time or of technical facility .
of course , there are also associated budgetary consequence .
that is a task i should like to entrust to you .
we got this past the member state with very great difficulty .
i hope you take another good look at this , commissioner .
indeed , there wa a time when this would not have been so .
i wish to contradict this in the strongest term .
this is what it take to preserve a very high level of technology .
belgium give 32 euro cent per passenger/kilometre to it railway .
the netherlands give 15 euro cent and the uk 4 euro cent .
in belgium , the railway are a socialist domain and are badly run .
for my part , i refuse to be a party to malicious intent .
the rail system is a perfect illustration of this .
our thought are with the family and friend of the victim .
we must have system of this kind in place .
obviously , our thought are first and foremost with the family .
a a train driver , one is responsible for passenger safety .
there is , in fact , enormous frustration among belgian railway worker .
this is the third serious incident in belgium in nine month .
it mean that the profit of major transport company come first .
of course , the question of the circumstance arises .
a a former railway employee , i have experienced the change myself .
the evaluation wa only completed a short time ago .
there are three point that i would like to highlight .
3. develop new rail transport infrastructure and implement the ertms .
we shall , of course , await the investigation .
there is a debate here which , in many way , is justified .
i , too , have my own very clear view on the matter .
it is then safety and competitiveness which suffer because of this .
there is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in belgium .
the question is : why wa it not installed ?
but i would just like to make some factual remark .
it is obviously a good system which ha very serious safety element .
transport ten-t network : again we will discus it soon .
this particular project deal with the deployment of the traffic management system .
but again , of course , the human factor is always relevant .
there is always some small possibility for human error .
the accident in italy last year demonstrated the possible consequence of this .
delay are becoming the norm , including in the case of tgv service .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.25 and resumed at 11.30 )
therefore , your point of order wa out of place .
investment project in energy infrastructure within the european community (
mr president , this is only a factual correction .
in the original text , the reference is wrong .
in this house yesterday , commissioner georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event .
therefore , we should have the possibility of a split vote .
i would like to ask for a split vote in this case .
beijing +15 - un platform for action for gender equality
green paper on reform of the common fishery policy (
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
τhe next item is the oral explanation of vote .
it thus - rightly - intervenes in the functioning of the market .
this is unacceptable , and hence i have voted against the resolution .
( pl ) mr president , i will speak very briefly .
i particularly like the emphasis on the ecological aspect .
since we are talking about this , let u be consistent .
i must say that the ukrainian people passed the exam .
today , ukraine need political , administrative and economic stability .
this is why i voted for adoption of the resolution .
the motion is quite right to refer to him .
i would like u to show greater initiative in this area .
what could we most usefully do to help that country ?
and so it is with the current economic crisis .
we are in a crisis because we have run out of money .
we need more european infrastructure project , we need a higher budget .
we have seen since the 1970s where that process lead .
i have voted against this , because religious minority should not be excluded .
i also hope that this decision will help save disappearing fish specie .
that argument is becoming academic because the fish have effectively disappeared .
a i said , the argument is now effectively academic .
the marguerite fund for infrastructure , energy and climate change must be strengthened .
one of the eu 's biggest priority is establishing an energy area .
the reliability of the system is important , a operation must be continuous .
energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth .
so where europe can act together on this , it should be encouraged .
this represents a further step in the direction of centralisation .
i therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
that give a whole new meaning to the word 'fair competition ' .
i support this resolution and endorse the observation set out in it wholeheartedly .
following the presidential election , ukraine must move closer to the european union .
the door to europe should be open for ukraine .
the stability of the eu also depends on the stability of it neighbour .
however , ukraine must show that it is a trustworthy partner for u .
it is for that reason that i abstained from voting .
the door of the european union must stay open for ukraine .
the high electoral turnout is particularly worthy of note .
it is essential to offer ukraine a european perspective in several step .
the european union must maintain an open-door policy towards ukraine .
i welcome the announcement of an improvement in these relation .
the presidential election in ukraine complied with international election standard .
the country ha taken a step towards european democracy .
from my point of view , there were two controversial amendment .
the second amendment wa the one about the nord stream pipeline .
we are lacking a coordinated approach on the international stage .
the world need governance that is based on universal value .
i believe that eradicating domestic violence should be a top priority .
many in my electorate in romania share this perspective .
the defence of woman 's right is important to me , too .
it is qualification that should be decisive here , not gender .
this should be the basic rule for men and woman alike .
it is for that reason that i abstained from voting .
we can address all this only if woman will decide for woman !
this is an indirect attack on the right to abortion
for these reason , we have voted against the resolution .
it is out of the secretarial allowance that meps ' assistant are paid .
for this reason , the fdp in the european parliament abstained .
the treaty of lisbon mean greater power for parliament .
it is out of the secretarial allowance that meps ' assistant are paid .
for this reason , the fdp in the european parliament abstained from voting .
parliament is taking on new power and new responsibility .
this amending budget fulfils legal and budgetary standard and good financial discipline .
saving have been made and will continue to be made .
no thought ha been given to any further consequence .
that very system ha given rise to dirty trick in some case .
now we may be leaving the door wide open to abuse .
precisely these category of expense should not be increased during the crisis .
measure to replace/improve vessel have only benefited large company .
the fishing sector in europe is experiencing hard time .
i would also stress the protection of the interest of community fishery .
we find this unacceptable and therefore elected to vote 'no ' .
we must also end the practice of discarding vulnerable stock .
the fishery industry is very important in the eu .
the first concern amendment 3 from the group of the greens/european free alliance .
we must recognise that a new approach is needed .
the group of the greens/european free alliance ha therefore abstained .
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i have several thing to say at the beginning of the session .
an official meeting with the police ha been arranged for 22 march .
we are treating this a a matter which concern u all .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
we had agreed to develop another prudent procedure for licensing .
i would like to ask for a roll-call vote on this .
the approval of the commission ha an eight-year lead time .
i consider this far better than such a rushed debate .
the european parliament is actively involved in these debate .
discrimination at work and in society must become history .
woman account for 75 % of the world 's poor .
this can , and must , be greatly improved .
this result in daughter being abandoned and even female foetus being aborted .
sadly , trafficking in woman is also a familiar and frequent phenomenon .
the access rate should be 100 % in our civilisation .
this should be an important objective of the new eu 2020 strategy .
a parliament , we could make a significant contribution to this .
we have acknowledged that the commission is making an effort .
my fellow member , mr wortmann-kool , ha mentioned other example .
the achievement are good but they are still not good enough .
i harbour a very healthy scepticism about it implementation .
the phrase 'just a housewife ' need to be outlawed .
today , we have had the chance to read the commission 's document .
let this be the first draft of a charter of woman 's right .
this is what the woman and the men of europe need .
equality is not about law : it is about behaviour .
i would like to give a warm welcome to commissioner dalli .
the commissioner will now make a statement on behalf of the commission .
in 1957 , gender equality wa enshrined in the european treaty .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
three battery each comprising eight missile will be stationed on romanian territory .
i must point out that the new system is not targeted at russia .
i am delighted to see that commissioner rehn is moving in that direction .
essentially , mr chávez is cooperating with eta criminal .
this week is also endometriosis awareness week across europe .
we must therefore strengthen the voice of obese and overweight patient .
yes , believe it or not , a referendum .
well , i have got news for them : i do not .
this paragraph in our resolution ha attracted much criticism in western ukraine .
this saw ethnic cleansing carried out also in the name of bandera .
the opinion deplores the lack of reasonableness and proportionality in the language requirement .
however , wage discrimination between woman and men exists on the labour market .
this legislative package must also feature in the european union 's 2020 strategy .
the right must be tailored to eu standard and the ilo convention .
however , the claim must be reasonable and proportional .
we now need new negotiation with the government in london and the hague .
that is icelandic : 'we have to solve the problem together ' .
however , we must also learn lesson from this tragedy .
will young people be prohibited from mixing red bull with vodka ?
we should trust consumer to enjoy whatever drink they choose .
the majority should not be punished for the action of the ignorant few .
that is what happened and now everybody is complaining about foreign speculator .
it would be better if we acted out of solidarity .
the commission declared 2010 european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
it is 19 kilometre long and ha a perimeter of 69 kilometre .
all this law would do would be to permit seizure .
we therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of formentera .
furthermore , the coast is protected under national and local legislation .
i believe high representative ashton should act to de-escalate those tension .
this quest wa successful largely also thanks to the solidarity of europe .
however , branding a whole nation like this is unacceptable .
i think there is great room here for development a well .
this is an unacceptable situation that should be eliminated urgently .
whenever there is an economic crisis , politician line up to denounce protectionism .
economy exist , or should exist , to serve our people .
at the time , it did apparently find a sympathetic ear .
we gave the floor to about 35 of you .
( hu ) mr president , i have the same complaint .
i have not been given the floor for six month .
we always sit through the debate and are sitting here pointlessly .
for half a year , i have not had the floor .
i do not know of any regulation so i sit here in vain .
animal health requirement applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animal ( debate )
i would also like to thank the council and the commission .
it sometimes seemed that we would never manage to come to an agreement .
the proposed amended regulation recognises the progress that ha been made hitherto .
i hope that colleague will support this work through their vote .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , the council and the commissioner .
commissioner , one of your first task here is to find a solution .
i am very pleased that we have this agreement .
i am pleased that the commission proposal point in that direction .
initially , the transitional period lasted until july 2008 .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , welcome to the european parliament .
moreover , from 2011 , electronic tagging will prevent confusion and deception .
here , the expense bear no relation to the benefit .
i have received letter from many citizen complaining of annoying behaviour at border .
we should consider whether this kind of behaviour is right .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , welcome to parliament .
now , for the third time , we are making an exception .
this regulation on pet will go down in history .
that wa an uphill struggle , but it wa worth it .
of course , we have also kept the balance right .
they wanted to take them to ferret exhibition across europe .
the commissioner is looking surprised , but there wa a debate .
it could be worse - it could be china , i suppose .
my country had a compulsory six-month quarantine period for domestic pet .
a a farmer , i know something about vaccination .
it is by no mean a guarantee against animal bringing disease across border .
vaccinated animal can also be carrier of the disease without displaying a symptom .
batch of vaccine of varying quality and forged paperwork is a real probability .
i understand there is no standardisation of enforcement of the scheme .
in other word , it is an accident waiting to happen .
i think that is what we should be talking about at this stage .
global travel pattern mean that the disease is never far from our door .
for these reason , the urgency of this matter must not go unstated .
it will be necessary to take measure in this area .
i welcome his statement to the parliament this evening .
the commission 's proposal and my report use a scientifically-based approach .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 9 march 2010 ) .
it ha also enhanced competition and consumer choice in the travel market .
however , let me explain briefly the guiding principle of this work .
the commission is planning to present it proposal early in 2011 .
these element will serve a a basis for the impact assessment .
here we are talking in particular about offer from low-cost airline .
this absolutely must be changed with a new proposal for a directive .
it wa clear that our law had failed to properly protect consumer .
our law now must reflect this change in consumer behaviour .
travel company must be mandated to provide very clear information .
under the current legislation , there are no clear line of responsibility .
now , however , we are talking about people travelling .
a you said , commissioner , a lot ha changed since then .
a you said , the sticking point and possible solution are well known .
there have also been call for a kind of 'travel protection label ' .
i should have liked to hear the commissioner 's opinion on this .
my second point concern the role and responsibility of travel agent .
therefore , the role of travel agent should be regulated much more precisely .
perhaps we should also consider introducing sanction in the new directive .
travel need themselves may vary from country to country .
people living with disability are given no opportunity whatsoever .
that is why i come back to my remark at the beginning .
i think therefore that it is important and necessary to review this directive .
cross-border problem call for a cross-border strategy and approach .
all of u here agree that the 1990 directive is hopelessly outdated .
this is only one of the example of insufficient protection for consumers/airline passenger .
we ask the commission to vigorously pursue this course of action now .
( pl ) i support revision of the package travel directive .
member who have spoken before me have talked about this .
such a situation is not good either for consumer or for business .
all the rest is a matter for the free market .
the latter is only liable if it guilt is proven .
( el ) mr president , almost everything ha been said .
however , i should like to focus on four point .
that is what we want from the new directive .
for me , one of these criterion is the age of the child .
there is , finally , the issue of bankruptcy .
we need to do more so thank you , commissioner .
many of you have affirmed the direction being taken by the commission .
we are now in the middle of a consultation process .
it is essential to respect the impact assessment procedure .
president barroso ha suggested using a global financial levy to fund environmental project .
here , there is even the 'no taxation without representation ' issue .
finally , indeed , are we right to mix regulation with tax-raising ?
we believe that this sort of purely european solution can not be countenanced .
i believe that this is illogical and not a particularly sound tax policy .
i want to see more funding made available for development aid .
i hope that the investigation will be both serious and effective .
mr president , this new way of discussing is actually quite interesting .
it give u the possibility to have a dialogue .
that is something that we should handle politically in our country .
the question , therefore , is : which tax should be increased ?
transaction cost existed before ; they have been reduced .
my concern are twofold with this financial transaction tax resolution a it stand .
we have ambitious target of money to be spent in developing country .
this , therefore , is the issue at stake here .
therefore , there is no point in deceiving people here .
is it useful for economic development to have a tax on financial transaction ?
it will not even hinder what are sometimes called speculative investment .
i suggest that you take a slightly closer look at that .
we await your courageous and innovative proposal , commissioner .
you can choose between usd 20 billion and usd 200 billion .
it can be of a global and general nature .
alternatively , state could make use of it in their development policy .
that is not what it is about at all !
on transaction tax , i have three area of concern .
firstly , the impact on end-users of financial service .
secondly , the impact of the eu going it alone .
we know financial market are global and very fluid .
the bank must pay off their debt to government .
that is the crucial question that we must answer .
i think that together , we have developed a very balanced text .
in doing so , you have our full support commissioner .
now we can not allow that to happen in the future .
thank you , commissioner , and i look forward to your proposal .
the other is to tax speculative capital movement and financial transaction .
it would also be necessary to have the courage to close tax haven .
we must put an immediate end to this lethal speculation .
we need , therefore , to start taking action .
however , the question of source of funding is not enough .
it is therefore necessary to formulate a common response .
commissioner , can you provide u with a timetable for this ?
there are , moreover , several reason for that .
the issue of european or global scale hardly matter .
what would happen if only europe had this kind of tax ?
there are several element that must be taken into account .
end consumer are the one who suffer with a new tax .
secondly , there is a series of technical problem to discus .
can anyone tell u the cost of this implementation ?
can anyone tell u what it effect on liquidity and credit will be ?
i doubt the new tax is the right one .
this , a we know , did not materialise .
the number of global policy objective ha , however , increased .
we have to be careful when faced with multiple objective .
let u not try to make it all thing to all people .
this measure could prevent the accumulation of speculative capital .
however , the implementation of such a tax is not justified in romania .
we must seize this opportunity because the time is right .
accordingly , part of this revenue should be devoted to development aid .
third , we need to get the analysis right .
the commission will soon publish it analysis of various option .
i have to say that it is not so simple .
we are carrying out an analysis and analysing various instrument .
implementation of the single euro payment area ( sepa ) ( debate )
not much ha changed and now i bring mine here in march 2010 .
the commission ha made an effort in it sepa roadmap of september 2009 .
it is not satisfactory to be done country by country .
one of these is the single euro payment area ( sepa ) .
an expiry date would indeed have several positive effect .
we will decide on the most effective course of action on that basis .
i can confirm for you that it will be based on legislation .
nevertheless , i would like to make several comment .
the procedure regarding mastercard is being appealed before the court of justice .
the fourth point relates to the future of governance .
the first meeting will take place in the spring .
the sepa council will constitute a good platform for moving towards these improvement .
firstly the appeal to industry that it must be end-user friendly .
we need a community initiative here , so the whole thing can work .
mr president , it is good that we have the euro .
they are in keeping with the objective of the european parliament .
public administration play a key role in the process of migrating to sepa .
i therefore confirm my commitment to setting that deadline .
annual account of certain type of company a regard micro-entities ( debate )
that is exactly what ha happened in the meantime .
there is a whole range of sensible reason why this proposal is right .
this directive we are now discussing date from 1978 .
i will stress again that the value is practically zero .
they only operate on a regional or local basis .
besides , the single market is not an end in itself .
it is important and it is good that we have it .
mr lehne , you spoke of several billion euro .
it could even be several year before these provision were applicable .
i know that concern were expressed about that in certain member state .
therefore , i wish to ask my fellow member to support our position .
within this framework , simplification could be made and distinction drawn .
this lead to a cost-benefit imbalance with regard to application of the standard .
establishment of an appropriate cost-benefit balance requires a reduction in cost .
they can do this a the regulation is optional .
this is just what tax administration and small entrepreneur alike can do without .
the best hope for the unemployed is with small and micro-enterprises .
however , eu directive make it difficult for micro-enterprises to operate successfully .
in the uk , we have over 1.7 million micro-firms .
we have all received the circular from mr sterckx and his friend .
mr president , i will just answer in one word : yes .
small and large enterprise can not be dealt with in the same way .
the organisation of our business environment is cumbersome and fossilised .
many of u collaborated on the small business act .
what we have heard here today , of course , sound very attractive .
however , the ability to monitor creditworthiness would be made more difficult .
otherwise , there is a danger of a loss of transparency .
micro-entities , moreover , can not afford this effort at all .
we can not always demand something and then subsequently say no .
that is my clear response to the concern expressed by mr sterckx .
finally , i think that the timetable is very important .
it is an opportunity to help small business that must not be missed .
we will see what we can do about that with the council .
we waited week , but did not receive a reply .
my sixth comment relates to the position of business association .
at this point , i think we should make that clear once more .
the prosperity of the eu will depend on the success of smes .
the greatest obstacle reported by smes is compliance with administrative formality .
in portugal , 356 140 portuguese enterprise could be covered by this exemption .
econ welcome , in particular , the emphasis on consumer .
that brings me to the first big issue , namely that of cartel .
the bill for this episode will be presented to future generation .
we have a duty to justify every single cent that ha been spent .
we know the current agreement will be revised for may of this year .
we call on the commission to put consumer interest over vested interest .
thank you , mr president , for your indulgence .
a far a the commission is concerned , your resolution ha two objective .
the report should be adopted in the second quarter of this year .
it will be presented to parliament by commissioner almunia .
now cartel existing and proving that they exist are two different matter .
a i said , proving it might be difficult .
the report also deal with the role of competition policy during the crisis .
the effect of this policy have helped to stabilise and mitigate state aid .
first of all , there is the monitoring of state aid measure .
i hereby declare the 2009-2010 session of the european parliament adjourned .
i declare the 2010-2011 session of the european parliament open .
internal market scoreboard - consumer protection - solvit ( debate )
we can warmly congratulate the commission on this productive , hard work .
the consumer market scoreboard is also of mr kuneva 's doing .
i very much welcome the second edition of the consumer market scoreboard .
we often have problem implementing european internal market legislation .
providing solvit with additional staff obviously incurs some cost a well .
at the moment , we can not afford to lose this opportunity .
we have a long way to go in this regard .
it now need to be translated into concrete action .
the same applies to cooperation with authority in third country .
to achieve this , national enforcer need sufficient staff and resource .
this benefit not only consumer but also the eu economy a a whole .
one element of this strategy relates to the handling of collective claim .
what option are available to the citizen who encounter a difficulty ?
secondly is the very poor use made of solvit a a practical instrument .
this is something that we need to make progress on for the future .
this concern the so-called internal market scoreboard or internal market test .
we therefore reject this concept , because it is the wrong one .
thirdly , we need good enforcement of these right at european level .
i would like to address a very clear message to the commission .
we fear that this will lead to the fragmentation of your responsibility .
it is time to follow up the green paper on collective redress .
we expect you to make progress on this matter .
however , the internal market obviously requires citizen to have confidence in it .
only then will it function in the right way .
consumer policy is , of course , a key element in achieving this .
we therefore need to work harder in this area .
i welcome the fact that both of the commissioner are here today .
solvit is a very important instrument in this regard .
solvit can provide an important and key addition in this respect .
in this regard , you can count on our support .
although we support them , we do have one point of criticism .
sustainability is very important here , a are social issue .
the subject of subsidiarity must also be given adequate consideration in this regard .
we therefore find the one-sided focus on the internal market check regrettable .
i can not but notice , however , a certain absurdity .
a legislator , our primary concern must be citizen and consumer .
i will finish by mentioning service provided by the public administration .
we could not agree to it in those circumstance .
this is why it is important for solvit to be developed further .
well i hope all my colleague agree this is absolutely not acceptable .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner and rapporteur .
it is important that solvit centre are well staffed .
the internal market is at the centre of what bind u .
it still ha a lot of potential for development .
the commission must highlight all obstacle and propose measure for their removal .
let u make this act a hallmark of the internal market .
this is of particular importance with the increase in cross-border trade and e-commerce .
i am pleased that commissioner dalli is taking this up .
we need a functioning market in health care service .
balanced , reasonable and correct rule are good for consumer .
the second great quality of these report is that they are generally accepted .
i would like to draw attention to several specific matter .
this would appear to be a crucial matter in the report .
i would like to focus on two crucial point .
that is often the case , but not always .
it is not enough for the package leaflet to be readable .
that is mentioned in the report by my fellow member ...
that brings u to the solution that are required .
i think an online address would create that and create more confidence .
it can not be said that we have this at present .
a standardised credit form is also an extremely positive move .
mr president , consumer protection : we are all in favour of it .
that need to be looked at so that there is proper staffing .
solvit is working well , but it could work better .
mr president , i will conclude by mentioning three specific point .
this is the approach that i shall be taking .
i support mr gruny 's idea of organising consultation and seminar .
the scoreboard will be our eye and ear alerting u to problem hotspot .
alternative dispute resolution is going to be our key mover in this regard .
the test doe not threaten any of the european union 's social achievement .
we should not react negatively to the word 'market ' .
i would like to add a few point of my own .
i believe that solvit offer consumer a practical solution .
solvit is a network which is already operating well .
this is why i am asking all group to vote for this report .
price in malta for a box of 28 : eur 27.84
price in brussels for a box of 180 : eur 135.13
price in malta for a box of 50 : eur 17.00
price in brussels for a box of 50 : eur 7.08
price in malta for a box of 28 : eur 34.94
price in brussels for a box of 84 : eur 21.71
doubt repeatedly arise in the case of certain member state .
it is also necessary to pay attention to the correct application of directive .
this end can , principally , be served by solvit .
movement of person with a long-stay visa ( debate )
however , this doe not happen in the vast majority of member state .
in this way , we have responded to any fear of decreased security .
i congratulate the european commission for this timely initiative .
i want to thank the rapporteur for his constructive approach to this .
they should have a period of validity of no more than one year .
in my eu , there are no restriction on this .
it is here that i believe the eu 's greatness lie .
the integrated border management and the visa policy should serve these purpose .
they should be the most important beneficiary of this regulation .
therefore , i call on you to adopt this partly amended regulation immediately .
it represents both an obvious fact and a step forward .
there are at least one million illegal immigrant in britain .
yet that is not what this is about , of course .
paradoxically , situation such a the one already described arise very frequently .
two third of these people are not making the homeward journey .
the consequence of this will have to be borne by our home country .
there are several reason to support the above initiative .
i have also had the opportunity to work on the regulation itself .
i think the voting today will be very significant and important for u .
i would like to point out a few issue .
these best practice can mean a lot to u .
we need to coordinate member state practice in order to increase trust .
for this reason , i am sympathetic to the european commission 's proposal .
freedom of movement should not apply only to resident of the european union .
it might sound like a technical problem , but it is not .
it is good for them and it is good for u .
therefore , we should avoid making life unnecessarily complicated for these people .
i think , within this proposal , we have found a good balance .
otherwise we shall have a legal loophole , with consequence for real people .
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : germany - redundancy (
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : lithuania - redundancy (
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : lithuania - construction of building (
animal health requirement applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animal (
the absence of the council is noted and is unfortunate .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
effective consumer enforcement policy is central to the functioning of the single market .
thank you , that is exactly what i wanted to underline .
thank you very much for drawing up this document .
the main risk are rabies , echinococcosis and disease transmitted by tick .
i think there is an issue of proportionality here is there not ?
surely this is something that could be left to the member state .
( et ) the objective of the schengen area is freedom of movement .
this amount to an unprecedented disparity between citizen of the european union .
canada ha promised to amend them , but is doing nothing .
i would like attention to be drawn to this .
their adoption is also essential from the point of view of parliamentary supervision .
they argue that it would damage the agreed social and environmental standard .
the request for action by this fund have been successful .
there is still much to be done in this respect .
i am convinced that such a fund must also cover company owner .
one such case is that of the lithuanian construction sector .
the request for action by this fund have been successful .
response to this disaster also need to be more than mere palliative .
it wa clear that it would lead to a crisis .
the duty of politician is to serve the people and prevent misfortune .
the eu financial support will alleviate the hardship lithuanian worker are facing .
the construction sector is one of the hardest hit in lithuania .
now more than a hundred company have been forced into bankruptcy .
we would prefer help for redundant worker to be funded by national government .
therefore , we can not logically oppose these contribution .
however , in doing so , we also felt a degree of unease .
a well a it security aspect , this protocol cover environmental protection .
a a result , consumer protection measure are steadily growing in importance .
i advocate a transparent policy where brand name of origin is obligatory .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the hedh report .
for this reason , the consumer market scoreboard is very important .
the aim is to have 'empowered consumer ' in the internal market .
consumer protection is an extremely important matter for the commission to tackle .
i am pleased by the fact that further scoreboard are being planned .
i voted in favour of the report by mr hedh on consumer protection .
the fact that this amendment did not prevail remains regrettable .
i therefore voted in favour of the report on consumer protection today .
however , the report contains certain wording that is problematic .
it administration must be reasonable and proportionate to the benefit to individual .
sometimes , this almost seems like a game or hypocrisy .
in writing . - i welcome the adoption of this report .
i voted in favour of this report on solvit .
many of our citizen and small business are unaware of such a network .
on this basis , the solvit network assumes a fundamental importance .
for all these reason , i support the buşoi report on solvit .
the internal market offer citizen and company a host of opportunity .
the internal market operates well , on the whole .
i voted in favour of the report on solvit .
the report by mr buşoi on solvit is very important .
i am often able to help them promptly by directing them to solvit .
the report we adopted today clearly describes the benefit of this instrument .
making a unique internet address available can contribute to this .
it is clear that solvit 's efficiency need to be further increased .
great britain , in particular , is making considerable use of this derogation .
the eu 2020 strategy is a document that offer much hope .
hitherto , this wa only done when issuing residence permit .
firstly , i welcome the excellent quality of this report .
adoption of this regulation is a necessity and a matter of urgency .
it is for that reason that i voted against the report .
this right is enshrined in the treaty , including the treaty of lisbon .
particular attention is paid to issue concerning cartel and consumer .
it is for that reason that i have voted against this report .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
such a situation distorts the internal market and leaf customer without adequate protection .
it wa the member state who set the implementation period for these directive .
it mean arguing for insecurity , unemployment and poverty .
it mean arguing for widening the gap between the richest and poorest .
that is why we have not voted in favour .
we need a clear obligation for member state to improve these indicator .
the internal market must also gain the support of our citizen .
this is an essential tool for communicating how member state treat european law .
european consumer are vitally important a we move from recession into growth .
firstly , the internal market scoreboard is a welcome tool .
we need to dispense with the 'cherry picking ' mentality .
history ha shown the wisdom of the schuman declaration .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
are we on the right track in this respect ?
i put this question to you , mr president .
what have you done to help eurostat collect the data ?
unfortunately , this wa rejected by the member state .
it is because of this that we have a huge problem .
that in itself is an enormous change from recent year .
i , too , would like to thank our fellow member .
therefore , we believe that all scientific issue have been fully addressed .
in fact , i wa expecting a word of congratulation from you ...
there are alternative available , so why take the risk ?
i do not have any position in favour or against .
i do not have any prejudice in favour or against gmos .
the commission ha a position that is to follow in those matter .
the fact is that our member state are not all the same .
mr barroso , last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy .
however , you continue to persist with the failed stability and growth pact .
at the same time , we will push for international coordination .
mr president , how fortunate that you anticipated my question .
apart from it own error , greece wa hard hit by market speculation .
at the same time , we have to look to the broader issue .
we believe these proposal will increase market transparency and limit the risk .
we saw an example of this last year in the united kingdom .
the budget for the college is fixed annually by the budgetary authority .
we are , of course , using full transparency .
you know how important social and economic and territorial cohesion is for u .
this is part of our dialogue with the regional and policy authority .
i would like to raise a case about fundamental right .
this relates to what the first speaker wa saying about eritrea .
rima 's family wa persecuted and murdered in eritrea for being christian .
she need to remain in the loving care of alison and robert .
what can the commission do to protect rima 's fundamental right ?
it is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits .
president of the commission . - there are two question there .
i do not know if i can respond to them in one minute .
in the united kingdom , we face a general election within three month .
( interjection from the floor : 'you ca n't do that ! ' )
it wa negotiated and we have an intergovernmental treaty that recognises this .
this will complete the european union system of protection of fundamental right .
if so , is it for greece to leave the eurozone ?
president barroso , are you prepared to give an answer ?
we had hoped to put that behind u with the obama administration .
that matter ha always been an issue of dialogue with our american partner .
human right always seem to take second and third place in our dialogue .
i would like to hear your opinion on these issue .
( mt ) one of the fundamental principle is freedom of movement .
president of the commission . - we are very concerned with this case .
intense diplomatic effort are ongoing to find a solution to the crisis .
already , one of the two swiss citizen ha left libya .
can the president of the commission provide u with this information already today ?
we are working on some proposal to address this issue .
turkey ha made progress in term of rule of law .
there ha been progress in some area , to be fair .
president barroso , thank you very much for a very interesting debate .
this ha been the fourth question hour in plenary .
international climate policy post-copenhagen : reinvigorating the international negotiation through immediate action
therefore , the shortcoming of the kyoto protocol have to be addressed .
eu leadership in this process will be absolutely vital for success .
i hope we can count on parliament 's support .
the communication that you have presented to u is also very interesting .
however , i would now like to mention a couple of shortcoming .
every project that doe not take this into account is doomed to failure .
we are very much dependent upon others to be able to make progress .
'if the condition are right ' , the document say .
mr ulvskog , you mentioned that i spoke more about 2050 than 2010 .
this is a strategy on the way forward for 2012 .
my fear is we can not do it twice .
finally , to chris davy , yes you are right .
we also need to have that in our different strategy and paper .
how would that benefit our economy , our innovation , our growth ?
where will our growth come from in the future ?
there , we should be careful of not being ambitious enough .
that is a good sign , a you start your new job .
secondly , a parliament , in it last debate , unanimously ...
the commissioner also spoke of an ambitious , legally-binding agreement .
that is , of course , a key issue .
of course , we should take care of our own industry , obviously .
we should know what we are doing and we should not be naive .
i am not saying it is going to be easy .
( de ) i wish you a very warm welcome to this house .
this could theoretically continue worldwide , but also within the european union .
what is happening with the instrument that we adopted last year ?
first , i am not here to represent the ipcc .
i am sure they are perfectly capable of talking on their own .
we still need , i believe , substantial progress there .
there are still many thing to be worked on with the ets .
( de ) a very warm welcome to parliament , commissioner .
i also have a question concerning the kyoto protocol .
what would happen if we do not adopt something until 2011 or 2012 ?
i have two question , commissioner ; one is on the quick-start money .
we all know there are problem with the kyoto protocol .
in the end , it is also a challenge for the european union .
we can not stand there alone in the kyoto protocol .
we are not the problem vis-à-vis the kyoto protocol .
the eu in this context is not the problem .
why should it be u that kill the kyoto protocol ?
i would very much like to work with parliament .
i think it is a logical thing also vis-à-vis the citizen .
we two commissioner are already having this kind of discussion .
( da ) madam president , welcome , mr hedegaard .
i am going to focus on the thing that i disagree with .
or is it the codecision procedure , or what ?
listen , that is not something you need be concerned about .
( de ) commissioner , i have two specific question for you .
is it possible that we completely overestimated our influence here ?
is that a subtle attempt to distance yourself from this body ?
we should be more flexible in the way we negotiate this .
i hope that we will see each other more often here in plenary .
this time , however , the 'finance bubble ' will be significantly bigger .
it is easier to ruin a country than to rebuild it .
what is needed is immediate revision of the climate and energy package .
doe the commission think that there are good reason for carrying on alone ?
i have , therefore , three question for mr hedegaard .
copenhagen ha made u realise that good intention are not enough .
firstly , investing in greener , low carbon technology is an important instrument .
i think that we have learnt from the failure of copenhagen .
strategic partnership for combating climate change must include ngo and civil society .
essential progress wa also made in copenhagen regarding monitoring , reporting and verification .
( b7-0013/2010 ; b7-0014/2010 ; b7-0202/2010 ; b7-0203/2010 ) .
all this is provided for and financed by the state .
they are therefore the minority that is most discriminated against in europe .
their marginalised situation is compounded by their lack of awareness of their right .
the second question concern the action to be taken by local authority .
we understand the need to commit to both short-term and long-term measure .
two year ago , the first summit wa held .
you can see a glass a being half full or half empty .
against discrimination ' and in specific training for legal practitioner .
this is not an issue that can be solved by a simple slogan .
they should lead the concrete commitment with agreed target .
this communication will then be the basis of the discussion in córdoba .
this creates serious obstacle in the way of the social development of europe .
however , we have talked about this comprehensive approach before .
'roma mainstreaming ' should become the working approach of all eu institution .
the change in the regional development fund are important .
however , i should like to add two element to today 's discussion .
this is a social much more than a political or financial challenge .
european fund can and should at most provide a helping hand .
however , the majority of government implement project that are merely sporadic measure .
what we need are medium and long-term political initiative .
we urgently need measure for the economic development of the rom community .
child are neglected , hungry and often even do not go to school .
this is why we must break away from neoliberal economic policy .
even the difficult social situation can not justify the violation of the law .
in hungary , gypsy are involved in a very high percentage of crime .
we have never specified genetic or ethnic label a a reason .
i sincerely hope that the summit will contribute to solving these issue .
the most proactive and open mayor are therefore facing enormous difficulty .
the average age for the first pregnancy is 17 .
the rom people have always put their europeanism before any border .
mr president , there is very little to add - just a plea .
this is another reason for this parliament to be active on this issue .
many country are singling u out because of this issue .
we understand a well that it is a question of politics .
access to education would provide them with a real opportunity .
however , effort must be made by both side .
the fourth and particularly important point is that we need integration without assimilation .
this is why i support the strategy of the union .
each state is responsible for improving the living condition of the rom population .
we must offer the rom community a real chance to change their prospect .
solidarity is the fundamental value at the heart of the european project .
we should make a common effort in this direction in the future .
rom child , to a predominant degree , do not have that .
now , we do have instrument ; we do have policy .
the question is , how do we utilise them ?
i have heard many of you speaking about schooling .
( hu ) mr president , we have a technical problem .
so there must be some problem with the computer .
the vote will take place at the next part-session .
so far , we have n't had any coherent strategy .
structural and pre-accession fund should be more efficiently used to finance such initiative .
it should be promoted at national a well a at european level .
i am convinced that the basic tool for tackling this is education .
the next item is question time ( b7-0017/2010 ) .
this revision of the directive would also include solvency rule for pension fund .
i am very aware of the complexity of this issue , mr kelly .
we were all obviously very concerned about madeira and france .
would he consider sanction of some nature for them a well ?
in 1995 , i wa the minister with responsibility for flooding in ireland .
we do not have a single centre which could react to disaster situation .
secondly , should we not put greater effort into establishing civil capability ?
for example , we do not have transport aircraft .
the objective now is to reduce poverty by a quarter by 2020 .
these element are all present in the eu 2020 strategy .
the action taken by individual member state are especially important .
without the ngo , we can not make completely successful programme .
i would like to draw your attention to two more flagship initiative .
how doe the commission evaluate progress so far in attaining these two objective ?
his final report will be submitted in the second half of this year .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
may i wish you every success in your work and bon courage .
subject : strengthening and funding grassroots sporting organisation in the eu
the commission ha recently closed it public consultation on funding for grassroots sport .
that will take account of the need to strengthen the grass-root sport sector .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her response .
so , we will have the communication before the summer recess .
many of those action have involved the european parliament under the codecision procedure .
but , of course , further effort are needed .
the commission is determined to move forward with this proposal .
10 000 people die every year a a result of these accident .
i propose to the commissioner that we must do a lot more .
( lt ) thank you for the proposal submitted to solve that problem .
i should like , therefore , to ask you two specific question :
subject : railway accident in buizingen and electronic safety system
can the commission demonstrate whether liberalisation ha affected safety ?
since when ha the european ertms standard been available ?
did any delay occur in comparison with the scheduled date of introduction ?
since when have the specification for such national system been available ?
the belgian investigation body ha the responsibility for carrying this out .
the system is known a ertms , the european rail traffic management system .
a number of pilot project were carried out between 2000 and 2005 .
since 2005 , several ertms equipped line have been put into service .
some member state will benefit earlier than others from the european system .
i have one more question for you , commissioner .
so i think that we should look very seriously at this issue .
a european system of measuring quality is a good idea .
first , in 1999 , from 2000 we abolished turning the clock .
we changed this regime and maintained one time regime .
in 2002 , we turned back and again introduced summer time .
so , i have very personal experience of this .
one thing wa that the daylight disappears in the evening .
people are happy and this question ha not been raised again .
how will the commission go about redressing the imbalance between security and freedom ?
the private data of the individual can not be jeopardised by other measure .
i have seen how parliament argued and voted on the swift question .
i have many question here , but not this one .
( the president proposed that the question be answered in writing )
vice-president of the commission . - i am sorry .
there is nothing so unfair a treating unequal group equally .
vice-president of the commission . - i agree with the honourable member .
there is nothing more unfair than treating unequal group in the same way .
( fr ) mr president , i fully understand the timing requirement .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19.50 and resumed at 21.00 )
implementation of the first railway package directive ( debate )
without that first step being taken , then others can not follow .
we need direct action and we need it now .
liberalisation wa intended to allow new player onto the market .
in practice , thing look rather different in this regard , too .
of course , we now need to consider why this is the case .
however , the hoped-for market liberalisation failed to materialise .
it is not acceptable to adopt the lowest possible standard a a solution .
that make an efficient and honest assessment extremely difficult .
however , it is not only necessary to make an assessment .
perhaps the cause lie here , or the problem is this .
from this point of view , safety is , indeed , increased .
a for me , i am pleased about this .
i believe that everything rest on and revolves around three main point .
austrian railway now travel this route five time a day .
so we can see how absurd thing sometimes are in this area .
we will pursue the same goal with the recasting of the package .
barrier still exist and resistance to removing barrier is still very strong .
that is the purpose of developing this railway reform .
the problem is precisely that this ha not been completed .
you can not then expect a high level of quality control .
mr president , each institution ha to defend it role .
therefore , we must take action in this area .
we need the successful conclusion of an appropriate agreement .
mr president , commissioner , i have three question on my mind .
i therefore ask myself , where in all this is the acquis communautaire ?
would you please provide answer to these three question .
i totally agree with the criticism levelled by my fellow member .
you are negotiating without a mandate from the european parliament .
lay the negotiation document on the table straight away .
all i can say to you is welcome to democracy .
this parliament will no longer permit back-room debate and decision .
we have seen leak purporting to be official document .
but what we are asking for is reasonable transparency .
why can we not have access to these document ?
why can we not have access to the text ?
that is one of our main competitive advantage on the world market .
those attempt have been systematically blocked by other country .
a i said during my hearing , those international negotiation are confidential .
we have done this in accordance with the framework agreement .
another public conference will be organised on 22 march in brussels .
however , a few acta negotiating party remain opposed to early release .
secondly , acta is only about enforcement of intellectual property right .
however , it will provide our innovator increased protection in overseas market .
the three strike rule or graduated response system are not compulsory in europe .
finally , you also asked about an impact assessment on acta .
it also contains an exhaustive analysis of the piracy of digital content .
your confidence and support will help me carry this important task forward .
let u work together to find this balance between right and responsibility .
it is not a blank cheque for copyright holder .
i would like to understand which of the two statement is true .
they have actually managed to get ordinary citizen interested in eu politics .
acta is an issue that people on the net really care about .
they are furious at the complete lack of transparency .
this is not how it should be in a democracy .
i hope the resolution will be adopted by an overwhelming majority .
nevertheless , i will now turn to the matter in hand .
i also have concern over the actual effectiveness of this agreement .
withholding information on such negotiation from our citizen can never be defended .
i demand that the negotiation are broken off immediately .
the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) is one such dossier .
this show utter contempt for parliament and the public .
the member state have absolutely no say in this dossier any more .
my group stand for full transparency and vehemently opposes the criminalisation of citizen .
what is the commission up to in that secret kitchen ?
this is where the importance of the pvv becomes clear .
we can not imagine a more flagrant violation of the parliamentary mandate .
that is significantly more than the european union 's budget .
this jeopardises our business , promotes crime and destroys job .
after all , we will be asked to give our approval .
that would , of course , be contrary to the e-commerce directive .
however , the actual scandal is yet to come .
i therefore ask myself , what are you actually doing in this regard ?
a the commission , you are the guardian of the treaty .
commissioner , put this agreement on the table immediately .
you have said again today that everything is already transparent and open .
that , commissioner , is the wrong way to go .
i have no doubt about it ability to start again .
the result of this policy are now quite clear to see .
i have no ipod , so there is no problem yet .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 march 2010 .
the commission itself can not make head nor tail of it .
the fact is , parliament will oppose any undermining of the acquis communautaire .
the chapter on the internet is a cause of particular anxiety .
at the moment , this is not the case .
access to the internet is itself a fundamental right .
regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preference ( debate )
we also need an evaluation of the existing system .
that doe not mean that we would take action against colombia .
first , the current regulation expires on 31 december 2011 .
such an investigation is , however , provided for in the regulation .
we can treat this in a number of way .
this provides for an unambiguous and impartial review process .
think , for example , of the recent case with sri lanka .
the commission should draft the new regulation on gsp a soon a possible .
even for gsp+ , we may be able to introduce a few improvement .
thirdly , who actually initiate an investigation if any problem are detected ?
parliament should also initiate an investigation in this connection .
cooperation with our trade partner must not be restricted to purely economic concern .
we must not forget , however , that the aim is development .
( ro ) i have a simple question for the commissioner .
a you will know , we are scheduled to meet tomorrow .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 march 2010 .
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
i welcome baroness ashton , and declare the session open .
union for the mediterranean : resolution of the turkey-cyprus conflict .
africa : positive contribution of the somali coast defence mission .
this specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycle .
with this report , we wanted to stress the following point .
we expect your guidance on this major issue , baroness ashton .
where do the member state stand in this regard ?
ours is , if i may say , a world in flux .
to engage with it effectively , we need to frame it first .
to me , the most striking feature of today 's world are twofold .
we are connected in way we have never been before .
the debt are in the west ; the surplus are in the east .
this redistribution of financial power is also shaping our political discussion .
it is a time to be smart and ambitious .
let me give you some figure to illustrate the point .
economic weight is translating into political clout and self-confidence .
if we pull together , we can safeguard our interest .
if not , others will make the decision for u .
if you want result , you have to act and sometimes take risk .
secondly , to address global security challenge , the challenge of our time .
i have since been to moscow , kiev , the balkan and haiti .
i will also discus it this afternoon at the conference of president .
any time you create something new , there will be resistance .
a service that represents the european union in geographic and gender term too .
i believe that is the only acceptable way to go .
the western balkan - i wa pleased to travel to the region recently .
in a way , the balkan is the birthplace of eu foreign policy .
we are backing up our strategy with available foreign-policy tool .
our naval operation atalanta ha been widely hailed a a success .
the way we are engaged in georgia follows the same script .
we continue to promote those reform and closer tie .
let u see how we can develop our relation pragmatically .
it is a serious issue that need a serious debate .
we often find ourselves approaching this in term of structure .
secondly , there is president obama 's nuclear security summit .
finally , let me come back to where i started .
some year back , we could say that this wa highly unlikely .
such a policy requires and presupposes an adequate institutional instrument .
on the black sea , we have to move from synergy to strategy .
on global security , we need a new arrangement reflecting the post-bipolar-order reality .
mr president , high representative/vice-president of the commission , lady and gentleman .
because , obviously , the world will not wait for u .
i would like to hear your position on this .
these are weapon that we can not fight using military force .
no , neither terrorism nor organised crime should be military target .
therefore , we do not agree with this military focus .
we do not , therefore , agree with taking the path of militarisation .
distributing migrant throughout european member state would not resolve the problem either .
on the contrary , it would encourage new arrival .
emigration must be a choice and not a necessity .
i think you mentioned , for example , russia and turkey .
mr neyts-uyttebroeck , thank you for your kind word .
some of the issue that you have raised are very critical .
that is a challenge we need to make sure that we address .
i think on those issue , we are in exactly the same place .
mr tannock : assertive leadership that is up to the challenge .
it is not about operating above the head of member state .
allow me to single out a couple of further example .
it is a precondition for our ability to speak with one voice .
it would be wrong to take excessively quick and thus wrong decision .
we are not under time pressure here - we need a sound result .
today mark 100 day since the treaty of lisbon entered into force .
many do give you their support , but many are making problem .
i will thus also finish on something that ha already been said .
article 40 protects the respective function of the commission and the council .
the alde group is anxious to press the accelerator on defence .
he also explains which point we do not have agreement on .
it is regrettable that baroness ashton ha just rejected that idea once more .
we in the group of the greens/european free alliance reject that idea .
( de ) mr president , let me briefly address two issue .
essentially , baroness ashton , we want you to play a key role .
we want you to play a key role without being bureaucratic .
you also said , however , that bosnia ha stabilised .
not everyone is able to take part in the democratic process .
you said that you have a strategy for bosnia .
when it come to kosovo , you described eulex a a success .
unfortunately , you did not answer a question posed by mr brantner .
will you set up a dedicated directorate-general for peace-building ?
i would be very interested to know what you really think now .
he is a serious person and always delivers serious report .
the presentation by lady ashton wa equally important and outstanding .
unfortunately , your presentation contains very little in the way of strategic vision .
what are your proposal a regard iran 's attempt to develop nuclear weapon ?
a trend that can also be observed in candidate country like turkey .
i refer here to both illegal and legal immigration .
parliament is ready to fill the gap of parenthood .
our parliament wa and is the strong proponent of strong eu foreign policy .
this prof that there are people with expertise in this parliament .
but we in ukip were on to this from the start .
you are expected to do 300 000 mile per year .
mr danjean 's report address the new security challenge facing eu member .
restoring political will in this respect is thus indispensable for a successful csdp .
i want to thank mr danjean and my colleague for their contribution .
there are a few guiding principle that i would like to mention .
that is highly necessary if we are to achieve a pan-european alignment .
secondly , it is right that transatlantic relation have been mentioned .
that mean politically stable relation , personal safety and economic development .
parliament will be on your side on this issue .
that , too , would be a crucial step forward .
to this we can also add the national interest of individual member state .
here is the very important leadership role - yours , baroness ashton .
good luck to you , high representative , and thank you .
i would have liked you to have attended , baroness ashton .
i also regret that the king of morocco wa not present .
this and other subject could have been dealt with at the summit .
the eu state and russia face many common challenge and threat .
neither the european union nor russia can solve these problem alone .
we really can not afford any failure in this regard .
if you switch round every month , that will be fine by me .
you have moved from rejection to a test phase .
this is what the report are saying that we are debating today .
we must , therefore , strengthen our operational capability .
the first is the political situation in the middle east .
therefore , mr ashton , your role in this is invaluable .
you and your successor will be mandated by the council only on paper .
i congratulate him on this report , a i do mr danjean .
you will need to act in a timely and preventative manner .
there is no going back , either for you or for u .
i also agree that security begin with strong political relation .
a number of honourable member quite rightly raised the importance of the balkan .
concerning the debate on cuba , i would have been there .
that is what the european parliament decided in term of timing .
on atalanta : i think the point made there are very positive .
what i said in january wa that i remain to be convinced .
on human right : i want to describe that a a silver thread .
it becomes an integral part of everything that we do .
i agree a well about the strong relationship transatlantically with the united state .
we also need to think about other big partnership .
just a little bit on the external action service .
we simply have to build it stage by stage .
if it were very simple , we would have done it by now .
we just have to make sure that we do it properly and effectively .
we will work that out in the next few week .
in term of resource , i am going to argue for flexibility .
on summit : we have lot of different summit .
we were well represented at the morocco summit because both president were there .
today mark the beginning of our collaboration , but certainly not the end .
this is what is meant by european defence and security .
never forget the origin of this european security and defence policy .
i am pleased that the amendment which i suggested have been adopted .
the european union ha ambition of being a global player .
the european institution must come to an understanding on the eeas .
particular national interest should not conflict with our coherence or our community .
secondly - weak coordination of the work of numerous european institution .
there is still no reaction centre at union level for critical situation .
annual account of certain type of company a regard micro-entities (
eu 2020 - follow-up of the informal european council of 11 february 2010 (
situation of civil society and national minority in belarus (
regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preference ( vote )
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i am convinced that we must prepare common european union rule .
however , we must recognise that each european union ...
i am sorry but i think we have heard enough .
some people think the strategy say too little about cohesion policy .
at the moment , however , it is more like a wish list .
( hu ) i voted against the eu 2020 strategy .
i voted against it because it clearly professes faith in neoliberal economic policy .
this is the reason why i voted against the report .
( nl ) mr president , the goldstone report is too one-sided .
unfortunately , goldstone make no mention of that whatsoever .
( fi ) mr president , i voted against the goldstone report .
it seems to me that we should avoid such one-sided , unequivocal judgment .
( pl ) i voted in favour of adopting the belarus resolution .
yesterday , i received a letter from the belarusian ambassador to poland .
the intention which are behind the resolution are much more profound .
they are democracy , human right and freedom of opinion .
we have to bring this message home in belarus .
here we are meekly rubber-stamping the decision of our 27-member politburo .
it is the case that national hero have generally fought against their neighbour .
first of all , we oppose new tax-raising power for the european union .
it wa nato force that protected the rest of europe from this nightmare .
( el ) mr president , thank you for your patience .
i think that such a policy better express the view of european citizen .
care will also have to be taken to protect shareholder and creditor .
reliable information must be maintained in order to obtain credit .
this situation will be detrimental to very small enterprise .
the activity of micro-entities are of negligible cross-border significance .
i voted against the lehne report and the commission proposal .
for these reason , i voted to reject the commission 's proposal .
i look forward to the council making a wise and well-considered decision .
i regard the commission 's proposal for simplification a positive .
the cohesion policy is equally important in supporting growth and employment .
in short , a new lease of life is needed .
let u hope that the eu 2020 strategy will provide it .
the 2020 strategy is supposed to replace the lisbon strategy .
europe need a different ambition ; the citizen expect more convincing response .
the greek crisis serf to reveal our lack of solidarity .
no member state can provide response to these challenge by acting alone .
eu policy can not be merely the sum of 27 national policy .
this principle of solidarity must constitute the guarantee of the european social model .
this doe not mean forgetting about industry or agriculture .
sustainable agriculture with quality produce must also be our goal .
the commission and parliament now seek to follow the same approach .
the rejection of our motion for a resolution is regrettable .
we must find answer to these question before the european council in june .
one of these target is an improvement in environmental condition .
europe is not the world 's most competitive economy in 2010 .
whether the 27 capital cooperate is another matter , however .
penalty on the one hand , and incentive on the other .
i believe that european expect more from this parliament .
the eu parliament wa sidelined during the design of eu 2020 strategy .
the sustainable economy must be a major point in shaping the immediate future .
i prefer that text to the three largest group ' compromise .
i therefore emphatically voted in favour of this resolution .
the commission is proposing a quantified target for combating poverty .
europe 2020 should respond to this situation with greater enthusiasm and determination .
compliance with international law must be a priority for all the party involved .
however , our policy is not a neutrality of indifference .
the same cause are the launching of rocket over israeli city .
the same cause are the disproportionate counterattack by the state of israel .
the same cause are the wretched situation of the inhabitant of gaza .
this serf a an obstacle to a full resolution of the conflict .
human right must be respected by all side in the middle east conflict .
this is not a good time to adopt a resolution on israel .
nor is there any information on the way hamas ha ignored the ceasefire .
the eu can not hold relative opinion regarding human right .
i hope the present resolution will initiate change in the desired direction .
every ineffective solution will be evidence of our weakness .
i wa pleased to hear the result of today 's vote .
adoption of the document by acclamation ha a special implication .
today , we have sent belarus a clear signal .
however , how is the banking sector going to respond ?
this is only a small step , but the message is clear .
the political and regulatory context in this area is different nowadays .
the exact method of calculation still ha to be specified .
pressure must now be exerted on the commission to propose concrete step .
public administration ' migration to sepa is below our expectation .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
however , i am very disappointed at how those negotiation are taking place .
it is a catastrophic violation of individual private property .
together , they decided to approve a confidentiality clause .
the commission should submit proposal before the next round of negotiation .
fortunately , that agreement did not see the light of day .
lastly , acta must not compromise access to generic medicine .
the economy of developing country are increasingly becoming knowledge-based economy .
however , the negotiation being conducted by the european commission are not open .
this absence of information is a cause for concern .
acta risk becoming known a the 'absence of commission transparency agreement ' .
we are currently witnessing the highest degree of militarisation in history .
weapon expenditure is higher than it wa even during the cold war .
this report attempt to position the eu a a stronger global actor .
ultimately , a strategy-based approach should be developed in the cfsp .
the eu 's involvement should therefore be reconsidered without delay .
this is in conflict with my country 's policy of non-alignment .
it mark a new escalation in competition with other imperialist centre .
i am doubtful whether this situation can be changed in the short-term .
the path of peace requires a break with these policy .
it is not a debate for the eu a a separate multilateral entity .
in addition , avoiding duplication of work would also lead to cost saving .
the european defence agency will develop military space surveillance capability .
these consideration have formed the basis for amendment 34 .
i am pleased that this amendment wa approved by 358 vote in favour .
international change provide new opportunity on the issue of non-proliferation .
nuclear disarmament at international level is of vital importance .
we are strongly in favour of a robust and effective non-proliferation treaty .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
( the minute of the previous sitting were approved )
like other international actor , we have been increasingly active on arctic issue .
that offer opportunity , but must be handled with great care .
all should continue to work closely together with other arctic stakeholder .
a you know , this is also the view of the council .
in addition , the european union 's own structure need to be strengthened .
you underlined the fragile nature and environment of the arctic .
the arctic also present itself a a unique opportunity for multinational cooperation .
that is something we must absolutely build on with other partner .
likewise , we - the eu - have been rebuffed for observer status .
this is a good basis on which we can build .
the region ha been compared to a canary in a mine .
country are quarrelling and negotiating about how the seabed might be divided up .
moreover , the indigenous people are largely being ignored in all this .
the eu should now be promoting a consistent approach to sustainable development .
mr president , there are many good reason for discussing the arctic .
we in finland are familiar with condition in the arctic .
they can also live in the arctic if they wish .
it is indeed right that there should be some systematic approach to this .
global warming ha caused the ice to recede significantly .
in 2007 , the temperature rose by 2° between august and october .
two arctic state , iceland and norway , are member of the eea .
this ha to be a very important principle in arctic policy .
mr gahler , you spoke about the potential for conflict .
that would not be to the benefit of the union or the arctic .
in doing so , he became a byword for arrogant folly .
some eu member state lie within the arctic region .
( lt ) today , we are debating a very important matter .
until now , no arrangement ha been applied to the arctic region .
he went and he discovered thing , because he wa an idealist .
madam president , the european union want a comprehensive arctic policy .
we will not have personal comment of that nature .
( fi ) madam president , let u get back to the point .
this debate must at least be held - we must use this opportunity .
i am grateful that this debate is being held .
i hope it will be held in an objective and open way .
( pl ) madam president , who will take control of the arctic ?
i follow with displeasure the dispute over both new and historical possession .
i fear that this may even be a new source of serious conflict .
we now move to the catch-the-eye part of the debate .
madam president , the arctic debate ha certainly generated some heat this afternoon !
this place look more and more like the soviet union every day .
in addition , the global climate system depends on it stability .
i , like you , come from the united kingdom .
the only difference is that i wa elected and you were not .
you have experienced at first hand the arm race during the cold war .
will you now be taking u into an ice war ?
you have proven already not to be capable of doing this job .
i believe , too , that the arctic council ha much to contribute .
finally , i very much look forward to going to lapland this weekend .
the european union must adopt an unequivocal position on this .
we all agree that environmental consequence of this process will be profound .
the cold war showed u how strategically important the arctic is .
we have witnessed economic , political , even military rivalry in this region .
the next item is the council and commission statement on cuba .
it is therefore our personality , our most genuine personality .
however , the european union 's policy with regard to cuba go further .
project are also being run in support of non-state actor activity .
let u focus now on saving life and on human right .
this text doe , however , have significant added value .
we did not do this for the military coup in honduras .
is this being discussed , voted on and condemned ?
what is happening with the civilian victim in afghanistan ?
what is happening with the persecution in the western sahara ?
no ! we will not be part of this hypocrisy .
the situation of political prisoner , for example , ha not really improved .
today , this tragedy , this tragic death , ha acquired symbolic significance .
we must show that we are in solidarity with the cuban people .
that doe not make you a criminal or a traitor .
when is the cuban government going to alter it position ?
it is estimated that there are around 200 other political prisoner in cuba .
no government can control or govern it people 's thinking .
any attempt to stamp out such thought and idea will always fail .
ha cuba not already had year of experience of this ?
political dialogue is the only instrument for moving forward .
the cuban government must take care of the cuban people .
it is , of course , the same commitment .
we must demand the release of all political prisoner .
this is why we should cooperate closely with washington .
castro 's dictatorial rule is a disgrace to the idea of democratic socialism .
we know there are different way to freedom for people oppressed by dictator .
it is in everyone 's interest to avoid such a scenario .
the key to this is to be found in cuba .
this , too , should be the position of the european parliament .
a the minister said , this clearly should not have happened .
we must denounce the detention of prisoner of conscience and demand their release .
there will be democracy there , and there will be a free-market economy .
i have carefully examined all of the proposed resolution of the political group .
it is true that he who is quick to condemn like to condemn .
in 2005 , the council suspended the 2003 measure .
subsequently , there were trip to the island by foreign minister and commissioner .
a head of state of a member state even recently visited havana .
over all this time , repression in cuba ha continued .
can anyone say that this progress is taking place today ?
in fact , this funding ha helped to keep tyranny alive .
the first step must be the release of all political prisoner .
in those circumstance we , a the european parliament , must do something .
the immediate release of political prisoner is quite difficult .
the red cross wa allowed to do this at the guantánamo prison .
i believe this is the way we need to continue .
people there continue to risk their life when voicing their opinion .
there are still about 200 political prisoner in cuba .
our policy towards cuba must remain conditional on genuine change there .
the next item is question time ( b7-0017/2010 ) .
subject : cooperation between the eu and turkey over illegal immigration
from greece , they then move on to the rest of the eu .
is greece being notified of progress in these negotiation ?
i must also cite the collaboration and cooperation between frontex and turkey .
( el ) thank you very much for your reply .
i should like to make a further two comment .
this visit wa followed by contact from the commission .
the very objective of these agreement is for those border to be respected .
you spoke of the resolution adopted by the european parliament in november 2009 .
this is therefore about protecting the victim of that crime .
it need to become part of the european agenda .
this is the aim of the initiative presented by 12 european union government .
i wonder if the presidency would look at an experience 20 year ago .
it conclusion wa that you need a holistic approach to this issue .
will the council examine that project to see what lesson can be drawn ?
this is the phenomenon that relates to this situation .
we are waiting for it to be produced by the commission .
what the commission ha done is to initiate a public consultation .
we have to wait for this communication to be produced .
subject : european year for combating poverty and social exclusion
this is the case with child , woman and the elderly .
( el ) thank you , minister , for your reply .
the economic effect are obviously worse in some member state than others .
i am returning once again to this because i think it is important .
this is what happens in any european country where this occurs .
are there tangible prospect that russia will join the wto any time soon ?
these are the two question a i understand them , madam president .
progress ha been made in some area of these negotiation .
the first concern democracy , the rule of law and human right .
how intensive is the dialogue on these critical point ?
how , specifically , do thing stand in the energy negotiation ?
we therefore need to expand the possibility , avoiding oligopoly or excessive dependency .
from our point of view , this is rather important .
this would be to enable such people to obtain visa relatively easily .
the russian federation is not a contracting party to this convention .
we would like russia to apply the espoo convention voluntary in any case .
it is clear to all , however , that that is not enough .
that would mean that eur 50 billion would have to be invested .
i would like to just remind you of the question .
when will industrial policy initiative to that effect be introduced ?
there is no need for me to read out all the question .
i will now set out the main element of the draft conclusion .
we should do so step by step , but a quickly a possible .
the initiative are mature for launching this year , 2010 .
at current price this is approximately eur 4 billion .
i am very pleased to see this file getting the support it deserves .
that is the option chosen by russia , japan and france .
we really have to think about where the money could come from .
fifty-five per cent of all co2 reduction will come from energy efficiency .
that is according to the iea , not a green grass-root organisation .
the only way out is to set clear priority .
that is the sticking point in today 's vote .
what the council ha put in place today is a series of platitude .
we need to reprioritise and redistribute fund within the eu budget .
there is slippage at every step of the way .
can i ask the commission to consider these thing .
can day , can week be shaved off it at all ?
that will help ensure that there is a minimum amount of slippage .
it will keep everyone working towards a series of set deadline .
it could blow the deadline completely out of the window .
let them put their money where their mouth is .
it also illustrates clearly the antinuclear prejudice of part of this house .
there simply will not be enough money for energy security .
this is why we can not endorse this resolution today .
lady and gentleman , it is time for action .
this applies , for example , to photovoltaics , wind turbine and biomass .
- madam president , there are two brief point i wish to make .
i would like to look in particular at the use of eu fund .
this will make it possible to increase this rate in the 2014-2020 period .
it is estimated that this will be from eur 7-12 billion .
i have only seen one formal study into this question of green job .
the strategic energy technology plan aim to contribute to precisely this goal .
we urgently need to move from word to deed .
it must do everything it can to achieve these goal .
in ireland in particular we have the government running away from this area .
mountain region produce almost all of europe 's hydroelectric energy .
of course , this perception is not entirely correct .
this topic ha certainly been raised already by other speaker .
we must not save co2 whilst at the same time ruining our environment .
it would be helpful if we all realised this .
i have read everything i could about this subject .
number two : how is the research and development to be coordinated ?
these country are entitled to cash in on their carbon dioxide quota .
in the case of hungary this amount to several hundred billion forint .
romania ha a more ambitious target of 24 % .
let u conduct research and try to be responsible in this research .
( de ) madam president , i will keep my question short .
we discussed the set plan for a long time .
perhaps the commissioner ha something to say in this regard ?
can you also tell me anything about this , commissioner ?
these initiative are also necessary to maintain european competitiveness and create employment .
it wa a period with the illusion of sustainability .
we need more clean industry , not more cleaning-up industry .
we need incentive , price , cost and the right signal .
if you add that up , it come to 75 .
i would remind you that there is a figure of 7 for nuclear .
the next issue is the source of finance and the road map .
we should put the money together to step up our research capacity .
there is also the financial regulation where you will discus it .
the vote will take place at 12.00 on thursday , 11 march 2010 .
global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact .
combating this process and it negative effect is the need of the hour .
effect of the xynthia storm in europe ( debate )
the solidarity fund should not be misunderstood a an emergency instrument .
we retain striking image and message from what we saw and heard .
therefore , it is important to announce that tourist can return to madeira .
it natural beauty and the warmth of it people await u .
for u this is a vital aspect to make progress .
the second is the systematic search for culprit and easy scapegoat .
there are a few point i would like to add to that .
however , the actual problem lie in the solidarity fund .
however , there is also a second dimension to this issue .
most of the netherlands is situated below sea level .
commissioner hahn agreed that the mechanism wa complex and difficult to implement .
after madeira , europe ha once again been affected .
commissioner , this is an extraordinary situation that requires extraordinary measure .
i fully understand the feeling of the people on the ground .
so i think that being better prepared is of the utmost importance .
there are also other possibility which can be explored .
i have already mentioned the structural and cohesion fund .
after the disaster in madeira , europe wa hit once again .
today , the financial resource of the solidarity fund seem difficult to implement .
we also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention .
managing natural disaster is an opportunity for europe to prove it added value .
situation in chile and eu humanitarian aid strategy ( debate )
commissioner georgieva went to the crisis room during the day to direct operation .
a three million primary emergency decision wa adopted early on sunday morning .
i welcome the rapid reaction of the european commission and the member state .
mr president , i wish you a speedy recovery .
unfortunately , tragedy continue to happen because of large earthquake .
however , it is not the commission 's money that is being donated .
they need our help in building a strong and unfettered civic society .
this ha been established within the framework of the joint parliamentary committee .
i would therefore like to mention the european strategy for humanitarian aid .
thirdly , we need greater coordination between military and humanitarian actor .
we are talking about 500 000 - half a million - house destroyed .
but we are talking about an overall bill of eur 22 billion .
we really need to up our particular contribution in that regard .
today mr pizarro will present president piñera with the presidential band .
may i reiterate once again my affection and deepest solidarity with chile .
troop who were already late in getting there were swamped by the chaos .
we have offered to switch this to reconstruction under review .
a i mentioned , president piñera take office today .
the commission stand ready to consider any request that may be forthcoming .
it is actually a net creditor , unlike most latin american country .
the eu ha demonstrated effectiveness and the ability to react .
terrorism can never be justified , in any way and for any reason .
( for detail of the outcome of the vote : see minute )
i think that we can proceed to the vote .
the european union 's appeal have so far been met with no response .
i hope this will also be the case this time .
i am profoundly convinced that this is an erroneous understanding of solidarity .
two thing have kept the communist regime in place in cuba .
the time ha come for constructive engagement with the democratic force in cuba .
the european union must set an example in the face of this tragedy .
the greek communist party condemns and voted against the european parliament resolution .
to call for the common position against cuba to be revoked .
to demand that the criminal u embargo against cuba be lifted immediately .
there are now other political prisoner too in cuba who are in danger .
the tragic circumstance of this death should put u all to shame .
the representative of capitalism in the european parliament do not accept that fact .
you can only express effective criticism if you yourself meet the criterion set .
the democratic opposition in cuba want the embargo to be lifted .
three voted for it to remain in place and two abstained .
none of the eu member state voted in favour of keeping the embargo .
the set plan intends to contribute specifically to the development of clean technology .
it is vital to move beyond word to action .
the set plan seek to accelerate the development and roll-out of low-carbon technology .
it left more than 60 dead , several disappeared and thousand homeless .
it is our duty to help those who need our aid .
i sympathise deeply with all the victim and their family .
in addition , hundred of people have been left homeless .
there , too , there are many people missing .
ecological catastrophe and natural disaster are an increasingly common part of our life .
let u show that it is the same this time .
natural disaster have been an ever-frequent occurrence recently due to climate change .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
yesterday morning , i spoke to baroness ashton personally about this .
the case of shalit is our cause , a european cause .
let europe make a difference in the middle east .
the geneva convention must be respected by all side .
the value of a human person can not be measured .
their presence in these gaol is also a humanitarian issue .
one-and-a-half million palestinian living there are living in a collective hovel .
we demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released .
they have not chosen to be in this situation at the moment .
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth .
or is there another hope for gilad and all the other victim ?
i would like to ask you to take the first step .
hamas ha kept shalit completely cut off from the outside world .
barbaric islamic force are waging an all-out war against western civilisation .
in israel and europe , every human life count .
and what kind of a position will we be in then ?
shalit 's case should not become a bargaining chip .
that is the message we want to convey through this resolution .
indeed this is only way for peace to be achieved in that region .
i am pleased that this resolution ha kept to the point .
i hope that it receives the firm support of this house .
therefore we join with today 's parliament motion calling for his release .
of course our thought are with the family of gilad shalit .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
this situation need to be amended a soon a possible .
however , violence against woman start in the home .
this is precisely why the authority are losing the war .
the ngo are producing ever more report and talking about crime of state .
the perpetrator of these act committed in may 2006 still enjoy complete impunity .
the european parliament ha produced it own report on this .
the government itself doe not want to admit the situation .
without human right there is no rule of law or democracy .
the strategy ha also attracted a lot of criticism .
those on whose behalf the activist work then lose hope .
( de ) mr president , we often discus dictatorship in this house .
mexico is not a dictatorship , but a democracy .
we are debating individual case of serious human right violation .
for mexico , that is not the key subject .
it therefore requires the right treatment and the right doctor .
that is why we should help the mexican authority in this difficult struggle .
the rising consumption by young people is especially worrying .
the commission is of course highly concerned at this situation .
president calderón 's war on organised crime is it main priority .
indeed , this area constitutes the subject of dedicated cooperation .
further cooperation in the field is foreseen for the period 2011-2013 .
we will continue to support mexico in it effort .
we all know that many study have refuted that idea .
however , i believe we have to keep the issue in proportion .
the justice ruled by a narrow margin of five vote to four .
the last time they voted it wa seven vote to two .
this barbaric punishment by execution ha no place in the modern world .
many argument exist against the use of this mean of administering justice .
for me , the most important is it irreversibility .
i hope this decision will not affect the number of sentence passed .
this , however , is probably not the key argument , here .
europe ha , today , abandoned the death sentence .
it is a democratic state , and a democratic country .
the last execution wa carried out 13 year ago .
there are currently 57 convict on death row awaiting execution .
a critical view should be taken of the south korean court 's ruling .
this is now the second ruling of the court with the same content .
in january this year , mongolia announced a moratorium on the death penalty .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
so well done south korea : go on executing your worst criminal .
in writing . - 'every person shall have the right to life .
eu guideline on the death penalty date from 1998 .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
i will reply in writing to the letter you sent me .
we therefore ask for the vote on this issue to be postponed .
i am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again .
preparation for the european council meeting ( 25-26 march 2010 ) ( debate )
it is being done in this way , by coordinating economic policy .
the head of state or government will largely be dealing with those matter .
that support wa clearly expressed at different formation of the council of minister .
the european union must of course tackle these issue , including financial stability .
we have already debated the europe 2020 strategy together in this parliament .
so , too , will be the contribution of the european council .
the target which the commission ha put on the table were carefully chosen .
this is also about the political will to tackle tough problem .
what we are proposing here is a new departure .
accepting this approach will be the real test for the european council .
i am encouraged by the result of the informal european council .
we need to keep this top of our agenda .
we need a clear , unified and ambitious position .
greece is currently in the process of correcting it excessive government deficit .
creating such a mechanism is also a question of responsibility and solidarity .
in other word , yes , europe must show solidarity with greece .
it must ensure that greece come through this difficult period .
this house will support it in this difficult task .
the second change concern the governance of our public finance .
greece ha delivered , writes the international herald tribune .
the president of the commission ha quite rightly spoken of a safety net .
it is not a matter of giving aid for the sake of it .
these do not include calling on the international monetary fund .
the speculation will not cease until such a signal ha been given .
should my neighbour 's house burn down , i get the insurance money .
europe must intervene to ensure that greece 's consolidation measure are worthwhile .
they are necessary , but they must also be worthwhile .
the state of greece must utilise the crisis to bring about real reform .
a i have said , the greek people deserve much better .
we need to explain the necessity of integration to our citizen .
we have made a heavy weather of this a when discussing the constitution .
the necessity of integrating economic policy is what need to be discussed henceforth .
it is the economy - yes , it is .
that is why i said what i said before .
i do not think that we have achieved anything else in common .
that is why you also see me with the euro-sceptics .
do you not see this a a contradiction , a hypocrisy ?
because it doe not appear on the official agenda .
is it that everything is connected to everything else ?
leading the union mean seeking a solution for greece .
everyone ha said so and i am not going to repeat it .
tell u what it involves and we will help you .
the conclusion talk about a timely exit from exceptional support measure .
we need a sustained social and sustainable exit strategy .
firstly , the open coordination method is not working and must be abandoned .
an open process would create transparency and permit citizen involvement .
i should like to touch on an issue that also concern other country .
mr schulz said that interest rate currently stand at 2-3 % in europe .
i have one thing to say about one-minute speech , madam president .
i hope that we do not have a mission impossible on our hand .
the solution to the greek crisis must entail tough reform measure in greece .
now it is being asserted that the blame lie with speculator .
le than one thousandth of global cd derivative relate to greece .
solidarity that help greece to accomplish what it ha to do .
what do the court of justice and the german constitution say ? '
nobody ha asked for money to be put on the table .
madam president , the spring summit is supposed to be the energy summit .
green job lie at the heart of the eu 2020 strategy .
i hope we shall also look at medium- and long-term solution .
we must strengthen the preventive force of the stability and growth pact .
mr merkel also appears to be pushing thing in that direction .
yes , there is the treaty , the letter and the spirit .
the first concern public finance , and the second competitiveness .
that is up to the head of government to do this week .
no , she did not understand it at all .
these are not the leadership skill that we need in the european union .
we have told the commission here that eu 2020 is too watered down .
please provide some evidence that you are able to acquire new fund .
that is why i am in favour of this major , strong currency .
this is the new development that really should be implemented now .
of course , we have been talking about this for a long time .
indeed , how can they think of waging this battle against chancellor merkel ?
our intervention therefore need to be free of any speculation .
europe must do so in the interest of europe .
the president of the european commission spoke about responsibility and solidarity .
now , however , it ha fully assumed it responsibility .
however , we must not hide our head in the sand .
greece is not the only country in emu facing serious problem .
the crisis , any crisis is the mother of change .
we should not be talking about how we are making germany le competitive .
we must now acknowledge that that wa a major mistake .
the whole world is watching every day what is going on here .
i am sickened by what i have heard today from many .
mark my word : the problem is here to stay .
the state of the economy of greece requires a depreciation of it currency .
the euro is not a solution to the economic problem of the world .
this should be a warning to country outside the eurozone .
once inside , you will be locked in for ever .
( fr ) madam president , i have one observation and three proposal .
my second proposal concern finance , since we do not have the instrument .
lastly , it ha been said that greece 's accounting wa flawed .
it is not only in greece that account are flawed .
i wa listening very carefully to the call for better governance .
these three european characteristic are clearly implied in the greece issue .
such a failure will not come about in the european council .
moreover , we are going to look further ahead .
we are going to look at the short and the long term .
clearly , very important progress is therefore being made .
it is also working closely with the commission and parliament .
i do not think that should be criticised , quite the contrary .
this is leading the european union according to the community method .
therefore , the minister 's speech brings the debate to a close .
priority must be given to the sustainable development of the european economy .
this would be an unrealistic target for a number of european state .
such an attitude is needed if the european project is to move forward .
the economic and financial crisis , and greece , require european action .
an end need to be brought to the public argument .
budgetary and economic data must be inspected by eurostat and the commission .
greece is an example that europe must learn from .
more european collaboration and le national egoism are the order of the day .
by 2020 , a single and secure european e-services area should be created .
member state should develop national plan for the digital switchover of public service .
the member state must produce clear concept , vision and idea .
the main theme of the spring european council is the eu 2020 strategy .
67 % of european citizen feel that job loss are their main concern .
until now , the european construct wa based on representative democracy .
participation by citizen , therefore , and issue dealt with at european level .
firstly , that it should be clear and simple .
in other word , do not let u make thing complicated .
it is direct public access to parliament that justly strengthens it legitimacy .
we should not raise false hope or create misunderstanding .
i think that it is something that should be considered very carefully .
let u allow the public to have their say .
the crucial thing , however , is what form we give it .
that depends on the form that we choose for this measure .
firstly , the formal level : doe it have the necessary signature ?
briefly , i have a second piece of encouragement to mention .
why should we predefine the issue on which citizen can raise an initiative ?
let u tackle what the citizen are asking u head on .
mr president , our citizen ' mistrust of the european union is growing .
the low turn-out at the eu election speaks volume .
what is this european citizen ' initiative , in essence ?
this new tool should be correctly used by being fully exploited .
in this respect , serious requirement need to be addressed .
let me briefly mention only two , knowing that there are several others .
the second topic is the admissibility of the initiative .
i would really like to know the outcome of the meeting .
so , thank you very much again , vice-president .
i would appeal to everyone to support and publicise this initiative .
i think the european parliament 's role should be much greater , here .
the second question concern the financing of the whole process .
who , therefore , will be responsible for financing citizen ' initiative ?
i think it is not just a fig leaf .
this legislation must be citizen-friendly and it must be highly visible .
so we need absolute clarity on this and we need to be proactive .
the citizen ' initiative is like a newborn baby .
it is therefore of particular importance how the commission deal with this concern .
that is what we must always bear in mind .
it is extremely important that the treaty are complied with .
( de ) i will now continue in german .
we hope that there will be a finished proposal by the summer .
that is important in order to meet the expectation of the citizen .
member state citizen will have the opportunity to lobby european institution .
the protection of national constitution must be given precedence and guaranteed .
mr president , i am very happy with the citizen ' initiative .
a far-reaching information campaign is necessary to let citizen know .
we must not let this opportunity slip through our finger .
naturally , the procedure must be simplified , straightforward and flexible .
that said , i am not here just to give praise .
we now have a right of initiative for the citizen .
it would be my wish that we should also have this in europe .
for this reason , i eagerly await an appropriate regulation from the commission .
so perhaps we should be grateful to the eu for introducing this .
another important way of exercising and consolidating democracy is the use of referendum .
i agree in principle with most of the proposal in the green paper .
of these question , i would like to emphasise one in particular .
on the other hand , however , this ha real possibility for citizen .
furthermore , there is support for it to be carried out quickly .
a mr kastler also said , this initiative must be applied .
there are many thing on which we all agree .
we would like to have a system which is user-friendly .
i would like to assure you that we will definitely do that .
we will widen this and use it even more in the future .
the new legislative framework on the european citizen ' initiative is undoubtedly welcome .
the citizen of the european union eagerly await this .
the commission received a few a 159 response from individual .
however , we must make sure that guarantee against abuse are met .
it should be simple , understandable and easily accessible .
the next item is the commission 's statement on the situation in tibet .
it is evident that difference with china on tibet remain .
the eu position doe not leave any room for misinterpretation .
the dialogue should also address the participation of all tibetan in decision making .
for the eu , tibet is a human right issue .
china 's shoulder are broad enough to enable it do so .
they did not even listen to what mr andrikienwas saying .
it would appear that china doe not want anything from the talk .
china want to continue to violate tibetan cultural , religious and language right .
we can not accept cultural genocide of this sort .
we need to keep this matter alive in the european parliament .
it is quite intolerable that the council should walk out of this debate .
the european parliament should also listen to the tibetan community .
event push u towards making some decision in this house .
the chinese authority say that the dalai lama is a private person .
nor wa it ever debated in the council of foreign minister .
after all , tibet is also an important challenge .
today , mr ashton is like pontius pilate , who washed his hand .
( ro ) mr kaczmarek spoke earlier about the protest in 2008 .
national security can not be used a ground for abolishing fundamental civil right .
if we fail to adopt such a position , we know what happens .
i believe that this issue must be dealt with during summit meeting .
i agree with the high representative in this regard .
mr šefčovič , you said you are appealing to both side for dialogue .
i wa under the impression that they are willing for this .
madam president , tibet and it cultural heritage is our common treasure .
this can be prevented only by granting them a genuine autonomous status .
china can become truly great only by showing respect towards it minority .
i know personally what a godless and materialistic communist regime is capable of .
i am referring to the appointment of a special coordinator for tibet .
otherwise , nothing will be credible in term of human right .
we european keep learning from his holiness , the dalai lama .
even you , commissioner , can not render international law null and void .
we are very quick to judge small country that commit transgression .
we tread on eggshell , both politically and diplomatically .
river have been polluted and motorway which blot the tibetan landscape have appeared .
however , there is some progress under way in tibet .
dozen of civilian were killed and several hundred were wounded .
the result of these effort are still not satisfactory .
we have , doubtless , not even heard about many similar incident .
the medium , today , are full of information about china .
however , what we are talking about here is more than that .
the next item is the one-minute speech in accordance with rule 150 .
we had more than 74 request to speak under this item .
thirty minute and 74 speaker for one minute will simply not work .
we all know how sudan ha suffered under his rule of violence .
it is difficult to say how free the election will be .
on monday , al-bashir threatened to expel the international election observer .
we know that sudan is a country in need .
italian citizen have come up with the 'clean parliament ' programme .
mr zuev wa killed about a week ago in kaliningrad .
this is not the first case of a journalist being killed in russia .
in our dialogue with russia , we should always draw attention to this .
( the president noted that there wa a problem with the microphone )
a i said , it problem is mainly political .
we are not asking for money from any european citizen .
for seven month , there wa an 'ice age ' .
apart from sanction , there wa also a result .
only 38 % of current rail capacity is used .
only big business and major construction interest stand to gain .
the 'no tav ' campaign 's motto is 'sarà dura ' .
we are fighting with all the worker to create ...
against this backdrop , we must ask ourselves two question .
for this reason , i ask the commission to remedy this irregular situation .
i see no reason for thing to be done differently in this case .
this house is aware that the irish state coffer are bare .
would the irish government be prepared to do something about that ?
the spontaneous legacy of this practice continues today against hungarian .
a well a that , the directive doe not mention scheduled flight .
thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceeding .
this , of course , pose a particular challenge - that of discipline .
there will not be a repeat - a second chance .
we have to establish very many thing at the conciliation meeting .
the budget for 2011 is the fifth budget in the multiannual financial framework .
a you know , the multiannual financial framework cover the year 2007-2013 .
we have already learned a great deal during the four previous budget procedure .
what is significant is that it also establishes the european external action service .
none of these undertaking wa provided for in the multiannual financial framework .
young people are already the driving force and future of europe .
this is a very difficult moment , especially during a crisis .
therefore , the committee emphasis legislative excellence , which is a top priority .
the first is that we are adjusting to the post-lisbon treaty environment .
we have partly adjusted , but some work remains to be done .
what remains are the modality in the conciliation committee .
the budget heading which appear to be under-financed are easy to detect .
here i am referring to heading 1a and heading 4 .
in other word , the report on priority is clearly upgrading heading 3 .
therefore , i am looking forward now to starting the procedure for 2011 .
brussels , too , must watch how it spends every public euro .
developing country are a market , and a fast-growing one at that .
we must protect the development cooperation budget , however hard that may be .
however , these guideline are also a very realistic first step .
firstly , concerning the structural fund - approximately 35 % of the budget .
we are doing only half a well a we did in 2000-2006 .
otherwise , we will have a situation where the money is not used .
on the other hand , it could be a reserve .
so the question is whether delivery will be satisfactory .
then we can plan the budget according to the situation .
we have so many need in other area a well .
indeed , those priority leave much to be desired .
in itself , this choice of priority is something to be welcomed .
the problem is that in politics , the devil is in the detail .
i believe that these question go to the very heart of the debate .
no proposal for an increase in the budget should be tolerated ...
investment in youth mean thinking today about the europe of tomorrow .
the cohesion policy is not a form of do-goodism .
true , there are enormous gap between the developed and the underdeveloped region .
we seek to eliminate these difference , or at least to shrink them .
i hope that there will be progress in this regard .
the initial report wa perhaps understandably vague and general .
i am sure all member will take that point on board .
i call on my fellow member to support these proposal .
i have a substantive question regarding the priority the rapporteur give to youth .
the report mention young people 's transition from education to the labour market .
thousand of cancer victim are denied expensive life-saving drug .
to them , it is a matter of life or death .
a he know , we will be doing that from september onwards .
new challenge for the 2011 budget arise every day .
i would like to comment briefly on both report .
we can not have administration of multiannual programme outside the commission .
everything is accounted for , down to the last cent .
i think we need the courage to make big decision .
we should certainly not get bogged down in minute technical detail .
i would like to say three thing about the eu budget .
the current eu budget doe not provide any realistic information on this .
we would all do well to take note of this .
however , time is also needed for this mechanism to begin to work .
investing in young people is investing in the future .
young people with degree are increasingly affected by unemployment .
our priority must be to preserve existing job and create new one .
a medium and long-term successful building strategy is important .
it need to be environmentally friendly , energy efficient and particularly cost effective .
even municipal politician like the mayor , freddy thielemans , admit this .
young people must be supported both at eu and national level .
it should go at cruising speed by 2011 , a should anti-crisis delivery .
let u hope also for a fruitful conciliation of the 2011 figure .
they are in education today and they are looking for work today .
young people are not only our future , they are our today .
once again , i would like to thank you for your attention .
testing will also start in 2014 on the safety-of-life service and commercial service .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
agricultural product quality policy : what strategy to follow ? ( debate )
i am delighted at what mr cioloş had to say .
the report had four , or rather five point for debate .
i therefore ask that we support the specific eu logo .
the second point is the question of the place of origin .
there is much in it that is to be commended .
we can not support paragraph 19 , the so-called 'wonky fruit ' paragraph .
i would also like to see some change in paragraph 16 .
so there is much in this report to like .
i would echo mr lyon 's comment on the eu logo .
these instrument have proven popular with consumer and producer alike .
i am against the introduction of an eu quality logo .
the fact is these rule were dismantled by the commission last year .
i come from northern ireland , a net exporter of agricultural product .
therefore , i want any labelling system to create a level playing field .
quality cost , and farmer need a fair income .
we also need to raise the general awareness of consumer in this regard .
we need protected geographical indication and designation of origin .
madam president , first , may i declare an interest ?
regulation must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
an eu-inspired crisis will shortly hit the uk egg industry .
i believe that we take the same approach to these quality product .
yes , they represent an opportunity for our most fragile region .
management of production right is a fundamental part of quality production policy .
do so quickly ; we have faith in you .
there are special product like this all over europe .
we have to ensure that they find their way onto the market .
the european union 's agricultural product already meet high quality standard .
european standard have a global reputation for being very high .
unfortunately , not all consumer are aware of this .
therefore , let u focus on quality and not packaging unit .
the demand of the market are diverse and are increasing all the time .
however , there are a few aspect capable of enhancing quality .
a wa rightly emphasised in the report , this ha to change .
the pressure for control and the consequence are , too , it seems .
we have seen the result of this recently in the listeria-contaminated cheese scandal .
quality-conscious customer are prepared to pay more for high quality food .
the designation 'mountain produce ' is therefore particularly important .
it is important that information on the quality of good reach the consumer .
consumer must know what they are buying and for what they are paying .
it is therefore not my intention to merge for the sake of it .
i should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land .
i am pleased to note the recognition of this indication .
this would result in nearly 1.5 billion working poor worldwide .
the commission and the spanish presidency will also participate .
social partner ' involvement can bring tremendous added value .
an act of god prevents her from being here today .
i am going to speak on behalf of u both .
the commission praise our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging job .
we are balancing the book but our worker are paying the price .
we know that this will have long-term social a well a political consequence .
i just hope we do have those positive outcome .
we know there is record unemployment in many country across the world .
we must make sure the core ilo convention are actually implemented .
the voice of europe need to be heard loud and strong there .
small and medium-sized enterprise are shutting down en masse .
the number of long-term unemployed is also growing constantly .
therefore , i hope that such concrete decision are taken at this meeting .
the bank have been recapitalised and financial stability ha enjoyed priority .
this is simply unacceptable and requires action by all concerned sector and stakeholder .
this ha improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation .
however , the commission can not succeed in this challenge alone .
tuberculosis is the seventh most common cause of death in the world .
a person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second .
ultimately , we are the european union and our strength lie in unity .
mr president , medical progress ha not yet overcome tuberculosis .
the number of case of tuberculosis ha been decreasing within the eu .
in fact , all area of activity in these country have been damaged .
trade ha decreased , which will weaken these country ' current account balance .
one common feature is the increase in the financing need of many country .
it is a matter of fair trade , commissioner .
cancelling the debt is simply a matter of justice .
keeping to the speaking time , too , is a matter of fairness .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 2010 .
the 'ladies in white ' are mother and wife of imprisoned opposition activist .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
i hope that a good balance ha been found .
most member state are experiencing rising budgetary deficit and debt .
i believe that the ecb ha responded fairly well to the crisis .
the primary function of the ecb is to maintain price stability .
instead , many bank have used the liquidity to buttress their own position .
the ecb is accountable to the citizen of europe through the european parliament .
i would like to present the report against this background .
the report 's message in this respect is very clear .
i would like to summarise briefly our proposal in this respect .
firstly , we need effective instrument for economic coordination .
we are asking you to submit a corresponding proposal .
first , on the economic development and monetary policy over the past year .
i believe we often play down the achievement that europe ha attained .
we are often too quick to criticise our institution and process .
but they have generally worked well , even in the most difficult time .
they might , however , have become somewhat too topical recently .
the greek crisis ha demonstrated the need for enhanced economic governance .
this wa already recognised and the legal base provided in the lisbon treaty .
i also count on your support in this matter .
we can also make better use of existing instrument .
this ha been used in the past , probably too rarely .
that is the second core element of reinforced economic governance .
these cloud will overshadow our economic landscape in the coming year .
we must do our utmost to clear the sky and bring back growth .
therefore , this is indeed no time for business a usual .
i have learnt two main lesson from this crisis .
today , the only genuine european economic policy is monetary policy .
let u be austere , but let u also be inventive .
they will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tension .
i would like to talk to you today about the euro .
the euro pose no risk to the mediterranean economy .
nevertheless , under no circumstance must it export strength be weakened .
so what we believe is that we should really switch gear .
greece ha 4 % of it gdp going to military spending .
they have got an air force that is a big a the luftwaffe .
it is such a tiny country and they are arming themselves like hell .
so i believe that europe is now at a critical juncture .
we spend too much time coordinating , too little time acting together .
so that would be our contribution to this debate .
however , the euro doe not sit in isolation .
the uk perspective ha a lot to say on difference in fiscal policy .
fundamentally , money to fund the public sector doe not magically appear .
it come from tax receipt from the private sector .
hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
ultimately , the public sector ha done it job in the crisis .
it bailed out the bank and stepped up when the private sector failed .
now it is the turn of the private sector to replenish the coffer .
major exporter such a germany are forcing greek economic policy to it knee .
therefore , this also represents a crisis in eu economic and competition policy .
mr president , 25 march is the birthday of both europe and greece .
yes , certain people must be called to account for this .
mr trichet and mr rehn were of the same opinion .
the gravity of the situation ha been accurately described .
a 'don abbondio europe ' is of no use to u .
greater fiscal coordination linked to macro-economic stability is an option .
this , too , doe not necessarily have a deficit trigger .
often , it ha simply been reinvested in asset bearing higher interest .
mr president , let u try and learn from this situation .
anyone who submits unsound figure can not point accusing finger at anybody else .
if not , should you not have known that ?
i hope you can give me a straight answer to that question .
it ha channelled over eur 1 trillion to the bank and monopoly group .
gdp per caput in the usa is mile ahead of the european union .
no , the euro ha not been successful at all .
let me just remind everybody here about something else if i may .
( ro ) the mafia is the major cause of the crisis .
i will give you a few example from my own country , romania .
this is no longer a market economy , but a jungle economy .
starvation is the most powerful electoral factor in history .
we do not need economic governance under the control of finance minister .
we have enough to do ourselves with the budgetary consolidation .
it is important not to underestimate the work involved .
however , there are other - collective - responsibility .
we share a common destiny , a mr trichet so rightly said .
i would like to finish by saying something about speculation .
the language of war doe not suit the style of bank .
my point of view , therefore , will be different .
the economic situation in numerous country is clearly negative .
the measure being taken to address deficit are exacerbating the crisis .
the necessity and desirability of setting up an emf are dubious .
it is really up to the council now to make a move .
the european union is one of the most balanced region .
the effort and courage of greece deserve clear and resolute support .
it is a question of common interest and uncertainty harm all european .
unchecked , ireland 's deficit wa heading towards 14 % of gdp .
the action taken by the government ha gained recognition in international market .
it is true that many are demanding economic governance .
the ecb will have an important role in this area .
quite clearly , i am sorry to hear this .
we must take this into account for two reason .
this is the spirit that we have to discover .
we just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finance .
in many country , cut in public expenditure are needed .
there is still much to do in this regard .
the political prevaricating of recent week ha not only damaged greece .
beyond emergency , let u finally give the euro the instrument it need .
why is the president of the eurogroup not in the g20 ?
we must welcome them with enthusiasm , not with petty-mindedness .
this is the price of the euro 's continued success .
it is a pity that the warning from the commission were too gentle .
some member state behaved like child , hiding their misdeed .
you and your staff have been a calming influence in troubled time .
the euro is a stabilising force , even in time of crisis .
on the contrary , it is part of the solution .
no one ha said that nothing could be done .
we must continue on this route in the interest of the euro .
during this period , the world experienced it biggest economic crisis for year .
the resolution we are considering at the moment is part of this debate .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect of it .
my country , slovakia , is no exception to the rule .
the vast majority of the population still feel positive about the euro .
that is true outside the eurozone a well a inside it .
my party is pleased that the uk remains outside the eurozone .
however , keeping our own currency is only part of the answer .
we are not going back to business a usual .
we absolutely need full and complete implementation of the stability and growth pact .
i would like to consult you and move forward soon with concrete proposal .
binding policy recommendation will also be used in this regard .
this is needed to prevent an accumulation of imbalance .
rapporteur . - mr president , a few point first .
we have seen that the recent recession is proving to be a challenge .
we know we are not yet an optimal currency area .
however , that is why we have to be innovative .
we have to follow sensible economic principle and policy .
we know that there are several option before u .
look at greece and the stability programme , which wa praised .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 2010 .
the first cause of this justified criticism is the objective of the bank .
on the contrary , it will further exacerbate them .
the euro is an anchor to which the member state economy are tied .
action by any member state which weaken the euro are unacceptable .

could you perhaps ask the committee on constitutional affair to clarify this issue ?

their value and norm are directly at odds with our own .
we can observe similar tendency in our country now .
however , this parliament is calling for even more so-called decentralised agency .
we are much more careful with the latter than with the former .
all of the member state are looking for budget reduction .
these are the reason why i voted for this report .
my compliment to those member who have worked on this dossier .
we see quality logo in a number of area of our life .
it is a matter for national government to legislate .
i will be very brief with my second point .
i refer you to the gospel of st matthew , chapter 22 .
our lord is asked whether it is proper to pay tax to rome .
he say : 'why tempt ye me , ye hypocrite ?
and so we have seen that the euro lead to common economic government .
thank heaven we had the foresight to keep the pound .
thank you for blessing this morning 's session , mr hannan .
but let u look at some of the thing that we propose .
this doe not change the fact that abortion mean killing an unborn child .
you will now collect about usd 6 trillion worth of capital .
no , what did we go and do just now ?
we want to decide for ourselves what economic policy we wish to pursue .
this will involve competition for our farmer and a further erosion of sovereignty .
the european union can do a great deal here .
we believe that member state should help their own redundant worker .
however , what little is given may relieve their pain .
the logic of the european globalisation adjustment fund is still intolerable nonetheless .
in the kingdom of eurocrats , a clear conscience come cheap .
this right is enshrined in the treaty , including the treaty of lisbon .
the irish labour party doe not support the introduction of ccctb .
the specific problem is not one of 'sound ' finance .
a ccctb is not about a common tax rate .
taxation of company is the exclusive responsibility of each member state .
clearly , this europe is yet another enemy of the people .
the verdict expressed by my vote ha a broader context .
the crisis ha ruthlessly laid bare the weakness of the common currency system .
we only need to carry out that process rationally .
we would so very much like to believe him .
three such important incident are a lot for one man .
i am referring to banco português de negócios and banco privado português .
that being the case , my abstention is justified .
in writing . - the vote in favour of mr fazakas is disappointing .
mr fazakas is suspected of being an ex-collaborator of the communist secret service .
they asked for the past not to be revived .
this would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility .
anyone , however corrupt or immoral , could stand for public office .
mr fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it .
he is currently undersecretary of state at the ministry of regional development .
in view of this , i decided to endorse his candidacy .
in writing . - i fully endorse these recommendation .
there are many issue of interest at global level .
it is true that it promotes the abolition of capital punishment .
for this reason , i abstained during the final vote .
concerted effort at community level are necessary , including financial contribution .
when will there finally be a policy that serf european first ?
decisive step must be taken to bring an end to discrimination .
in principle , the measure for combating poverty in eastern europe make sense .
for this reason , i have voted against the report .
measure taken to combat discrimination against the rom continue to be insufficient .
however , this resolution imposed rule and guideline that would impede this function .
in this draft decision , the council exceeds it executive power .
facility such a this should not be set in motion .
the opinion of parliament 's legal service is very clear .
i voted in favour of this report on the priority for budget 2011 .
investing in young people is investing in the future .
young people with degree and qualification are increasingly affected by unemployment .
we largely agree with the priority stated in the report .
however , this is neither the only way nor inevitable .
this must also be reflected in the budgetary priority .
young people are at the heart of european social and inclusion strategy .
i shall vote against this report on priority for the 2011 budget .
i did , of course , vote in favour .
i am happy with the report 's cautionary aspect .
the treaty of lisbon ha given parliament new responsibility .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this important report .
it could be particularly beneficial to our agri-food sector .
the traditional speciality guaranteed and organic farming scheme must also be retained .
therefore , i absolutely can not vote for it .
i noted the intention to move away from the logic of productivism .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the report .
however , compliance with imported product to equivalent quality specification remains a problem .
for this reason , i have voted against this amendment .
i voted for the report on the future of food quality policy .
i come to the important question of geographical indication and traditional speciality .
in writing . - i fully support this report .
financial aid alone can not ensure economic progress in developing country .
thus , the commission should urge the reform of international development cooperation .
i call for additional fund to be earmarked for developing country .
i support this report 's call for a sustained increase in development aid .
it support cancelling the debt of the least developed country .
for u liberal , investment in developing country is dear to our heart .
this requires more coordinated action at bilateral and multilateral level .
this text support the implacable logic of liberal dogmatism .
also , the decision regarding the so-called right to sexual and reproductive health .
traditional development aid ha largely failed in it purpose .
these measure should be correlated with action to end tax haven .
above all , we are not doing anything concrete to change the system .
clearly , this europe is yet another enemy of the people .
we are still waiting for the result of these action .

conclusion of the european council meeting ( 25-26 march 2010 ) ( debate )
the union 's capacity to find a compromise remains intact .
those measure were requested by the informal european council of 11 february .
two further aspect of the statement have given rise to much comment .
first , the european council want to draw lesson from this crisis .
that is why it created a task force under my authority .
it will present it conclusion before the end of this year .
the european council will take the final political decision .
i intend to give a high priority to this work .
finally , promoting social inclusion , in particular through the reduction of poverty .
it will be the result of our effort , not an instrument .
it corresponds to the profound aspiration of people for fairness in our economy .
cop-2 in cancun must produce concrete decision and must address remaining gap .
that will also be the case for the european parliament .
there were not many people who would have predicted this outcome .
but let u be frank about another point a well .
the question wa not whether there would be a response .
the question wa what the response could and should be .
this is what we needed and this is what we have got .
the commission is satisfied with the final shape of the mechanism .
it is surely unprecedented , although designed in full respect of the treaty .
the institution keep the role of triggering the mechanism .
let me now turn to the discussion of the europe 2020 strategy .
delivery will require a collective effort by all stakeholder at all level .
the commission 's view on the matter is also very clear .
the commission is determined to ensure that this is not the case .
it is about making all level work well and together a a whole .
we have the track record of action inside the eu .
what we now need is to be determined and consistent .
the commission acknowledges that parliament is already engaged in this effort .
we need to cement the advance made in the copenhagen accord .
the only thing that matter to our citizen are the result .
solidarity and responsibility rightly take centre stage in this plan .
the message that ha come from the council is not a positive one .
the council is always keen to delay issue and discussion and proposal .
what doe the council then do to europe 2020 ?
you will have a second european council in june .
i wish you every success for that european council .
this did not start yesterday , but a week ago now .
that is the only way to help the greek government achieve it target .
my group feel that three main element are needed in that package .
that is not a punishment for the biggest country , germany .
the technical mean to do this exist and can be made applicable .
the third thing we need is a bolder 2020 strategy .
the rate thus went up immediately after the council 's decision .
if it were a net , it would have to bear weight .
this behaviour , to my mind , is not right .
there ha thus been so much negative energy from germany !
i have to say , i wa not one of them .
we do not support all aspect of the initiative .
over 20 % of under-25-year-olds are out of work .
well , what price free speech , what price democracy ?
just look at the disastrous , ruinous common fishery policy .
a far a we are concerned this is unfinished business .
fine word also from angela merkel : not one cent towards greek pension .
they have changed their mind ; they have buckled .
portugal , spain , hungary , you name it .
mr van baalen , why are you not contradicting mr verhofstadt ?
it is your own group that is advocating this .
mr president , lady and gentleman , i will be fairly brief .
there are some basic truth of which i must remind you .
step must be taken to prevent them ever occurring again .
we must , therefore , start with the basic : budgetary orthodoxy .
that is why we created the stability and growth pact in the past .
some people are arguing for sanction , penalty and a show of toughness .
they were laid down in the informal council statement of 11 february .
it ha taken them ; it ha shouldered it responsibility .
we can force people to be happy , but they were in agreement .
i witnessed their agreement before , during and after the meeting .
thirdly , they have not yet asked for financial support .
history never repeat itself and certainly not in the same way .
we must draw every consequence there is to draw from it .
we must , therefore , also be more preventative in economic term .
we will , therefore , think about all of that .
we will discus them openly in the task force .
there are economic objective , environmental objective and social objective .
however , we must continue to work on it .
parliament ha a major role to play in term of financial regulation .
the g20 worked hard at the start of the crisis .
it is necessary to work hard following a recession .
the crisis is still not quite over , but the recession is over .
i really think that we have laid the foundation for future action .
the task force is , let u say , the embodiment of wisdom .
thank you for your straightforward reply to the remark which were made .
there were critical remark , which we all heard .
we are talking about a matter of the greatest importance .
on top of this there are matter relating to climate .
we in the eu can only do so much .
we can coordinate , and do better within our european framework .
if i might be critical , i prefer ambitious reform before ambitious ambition .
one thing that is immediately needed is energy efficiency .
find the courage to put forward the proposal on energy efficiency .
finally , on the role of parliament : consulting is not enough .
i wish to ask something about the eu 2020 strategy .
this is not a revolutionary idea , nor wa it my idea .
if not , we shall become the bruges of the globalised world .
a new orgy of speculation , with borrowing rate hitting historic high .
social dumping ha become the only competitive tool in the european union .
this is not the europe of solidarity and cohesion .
this is what europe need : real subsidiarity and real federalism .
did you actually not know anything about the financial imbalance in greece ?
who is responsible for the fact that greece ha delivered inaccurate budget figure ?
however , there is always talk of new ground rule and solution .
these have been on the table for some time already !
that is why independence is so very important in politics .
wa he not invited , or is this an error in the minute ?
generally , it wa a presentation of the position of the european parliament .
i spoke for about 15-20 minute on the most important point .
you can read it ; i will send it to you .
they have sunk almost without trace in this communiqué .
we are working on implementing those , which i am pleased about .
in one way , i think that we have taken a step forward .
you have preached the status quo on climate policy .
secondly , i would like to offer mr reul 's excuse .
the criterion when it come to money are clear .
a you know , the greek government ha denied these rumour .
these two thing feature in the report that parliament is currently debating .
they do not feature in the agreement that the council reached in december .
( hu ) i would like to make two remark .
they promised it will be ready by the end of april .
in any event , the idea seem too general for the moment .
however , this is about u and the political party we belong to .
president van rompuy , you spoke about budgetary discipline .
there is considerable contradiction within the specification of goal .
this will also be an important point to note when implementing europe 2020 .
the commission need to clarify the flow of information with greece .
the comission must clearly indicate where institutional and personal responsibility rest .
this is an issue which is different from supporting greece .
i would like to answer telegraphically some of those question .
this will be quite detailed . it will be a measure-by-measure description .
a lot of member spoke on the issue of greece .
this wa the best solution we could find under very challenging circumstance .
that is exactly what we would like to achieve .
there are just a few point that i wish to stress .
indeed , europe ha contributed a very large amount .
moreover , the greek finance minister said this very clearly yesterday .
he did not , i repeat once again , request financial assistance .
there is a great deal of work to do .
penalty may be applied only where they are provided for by the treaty .
he ha sounded the alarm , and rightly so .
a major protectionist movement ha certainly been avoided in europe .
in fact , we face some very great challenge in three area .
why not include the internal market in the five objective ?
it is an instrument , but an important one .
just a there is the common currency , there is the common market .
it must be developed further to help increase growth and employment .
many of the speech consisted of comment , not question .
i have therefore noted them , and i will give them some thought .
this is a very important discussion for all of u .
the condition for increasing investment in research and innovation must be improved .
the solution proposed is everything but a european one .
their functioning today , however , is still marked by contradiction .
effective climate protection regulation will continue to require flexibility mechanism .
with this in mind , we must all make effort .
i am counting on good and comprehensive cooperation in this area .
this is an important step towards strengthening european solidarity .
greece is not the only state in the euro area facing financial problem .
the situation of the greek economy ha , undoubtedly , aroused much emotion .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
it wa , a we all remember , a very serious railway accident .
i would like to thank you again for this act of solidarity .
this accident wa not due to a technical fault , either .
an extraordinary meeting of the conference of president ended a few minute ago .
( first part of the change : see previous item )
it is nice for you to congratulate u for being here today .
although it is difficult , it is our job .
those who are not here today may then perhaps also come .
mr president , i would like to concur with the gentleman over there .
i think it is absolutely abysmal that you have done that .
i think there are enough people here to vote .
surely the time ha come for this place to be shut down .
lady and gentleman , this is my proposal to you .
we will decide later ; it is not necessary to decide that now .
i do not want any further point of order now .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
mr president , thank you for letting me speak again .
you are going to discus thing which will not represent the united kingdom .
we have two day : 5 and 6 may .
before we begin , i would like to make an announcement .
we should , therefore , think about a specific design of label .
will there perhaps be another few minute of catch-the-eye ?
application of the new rule will begin with the meeting in brussels .
i am pleased that romania ha again refrained from implementing these plan .
the only sensible thing to do is to implement a castration programme .
the funeral of the president and his wife wa held yesterday .
i would ask the commission to respond to this appeal .
i would like , today , to mention the problem of eurostat .
the economy can not take priority over people 's safety .
it is our duty to prevent the occurrence of social dumping .
these programme forecast the medium- and long-term position of the various member state .
supplementary question using the blue card are not permitted during the one-minute speech .
thus , it wa not a point of order .
you gave the floor to a man five time in a row .
those who criticised the treaty of lisbon spoke of a democratic deficit .
from now on , it will be possible to do so .
we might disagree on some specific question but our objective are the same .
i have another specific comment on the duration of the right of objection .
we were informed , but we were not colegislators .
we want to receive information a early a the council receives it .
that is actually the key point in this regard .
article 290 is therefore a product of the illegitimate lisbon treaty .
we will need to remind ourselves of this again and again .
once again , this ha a lot to do with transparency .
on that note , i would say keep up the good work .
we will be constructive partner on the road to revolutionising democracy .
in fact , article 290 refers precisely to this matter .
this wa underlined by the rapporteur , mr szájer .
in practice , parliament wa not assigned any role in this process .
the vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in brussels .
defining the new legislative system is a difficult and complex issue .
the introduction of the novel concept of legislative act ha far-reaching consequence .
how we can now build on this is the question facing u today .
would the commission consider establishing harmonised and standardised ramp check and reporting ?
nevertheless , i would like to put some question to the commission .
moreover , another very important point in my opinion is aeroplane monitoring .
we must build on and learn from the experience we have gained .
there are some area where further action is necessary .
first of all , in the area of communication with passenger .
we will soon be discussing how we can remedy this situation .
of course , this doe not need to influence safety .
i would like to have an answer to this generally in the debate .
have there been any positive or negative development with regard to this ?
the european parliament is speaking on this matter yet again .
this show what importance we attach to the matter .
i spoke about this a couple of month ago .
after everything that ha been said , i have a personal reflection .
this code control the export from the eu of military technology and equipment .
what is happening here to inform people who need to fly ?
i will mention an example from indonesia that wa asked of me .
we will look into this accordingly and see what happened .
however , we will have to pay for this .
what specifically will it change , and what doe it aim to change ?
there are state which have financed them purely through taxation .
our intention wa to ensure that these system could be retained .
i think that they are all very justified and well-founded .
blue card question on a personal comment under rule 151 are not permitted .
your request to speak on this point therefore can not be accepted .
i would like half a minute to ask a question .
it is , today , a challenge for the council and the commission .
obviously , we need to bear in mind a few consideration .
the first and the most essential one is transparency .
she arranged everything together with you , and wa also completely satisfied .
of course , the state do not want to pay for it .
so , aviation security charge of this kind must be administered transparently .
nobody should be lost in a jungle of unclear charge and levy .
i wholeheartedly support the report by the committee on transport and tourism ...
we had an interesting discussion in the committee on transport and tourism .
this is quite an important consideration in my view .
we are already compromising by leaving some thing to so-called subsidiarity .
security charge and security overall have increased significantly in recent year .
therefore , this dossier also ha an economic aspect .
we are now talking about around 30 % of the cost .
therefore , these three point are crucial for me .
i would also like to mention the ban on bringing liquid on board .
i therefore fear that we will ultimately see very little progress .
i agree with adopting exceptional measure in the scenario already mentioned .
what , in the end , is the issue here ?
whoever order government-related security measure also pay for them .
i would hope that the end result is very close to our proposal .
the report and the commission proposal strengthen each other .
i believe that the timing and scope of the proposal are correct .
we have worked hard on this matter for nearly a year now .
from the start , we have been very willing to compromise .
the vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in brussels .
the change are not about updating the map or making any substantive change .
then this methodology will definitely be presented to this house and the council .
this is the reason for our amendment , therefore .
it is our responsibility to give our citizen good , clear information .
( de ) madam president , yes , i rather prefer 'non-attached ' .
moreover , the financing ha still not been clarified .
however , we must not simply take a 'just-in-time ' approach .
these are thing that we will need to take into account in future .
it then suddenly disappeared again - and no one know why .
that is why it must no longer be included in these guideline .
that is something that we should all take note of .
however , that is the wrong way to go about it .
i feel that particular attention must be focused on corridor 7 .
it could provide europe with a proper transport backbone .
of course , it is clear that there are always national interest .
commission vice-president kallas will send the proposal to the college on 5 may .
the vote will take place during the next plenary sitting in brussels .
the first key point is the importance of the sector .
in both case , that would be tantamount to flogging a dead horse .
this mean efficient , safe , secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport service .
the main work on the strategy wa carried out before the economic crisis .
in view of the economic downturn , the strategy is still valid .
the first challenge is the need to increase competition .
it is a fact that free competition is the life blood of shipping .
there are numerous other point that i could mention here .
mr van dalen , congratulation on this excellent report .
we highlight the promotion of maritime occupation and continuous training for them .
lastly , we highlight the priority given to environmental issue .
in particular , it is a useful tool against global warming .
we will therefore be retabling our amendment to plenary .
this is positive , but the fight ha yet to really begin .
i also support the requirement for shipbuilding and steel quality .
if they sail only half-full , the freight cost are too high .
piracy - why is this problem only mentioned in an african context ?
the problem is far greater in the water around indonesia .
we should invest in strengthening coastal maritime transport , not weakening it .
i am referring to the situation in the horn of africa .
in other word , we must counteract the risk of deflagging .
these are the thing we need to build on .
finally , it go without saying that safety is essential .
you can only create a thriving profession if it can be undertaken safely .
we have all seen that he is wholeheartedly committed to maritime transport .
ninety per cent of our export and import are transported via the port .
shipping is very environmentally friendly , particularly where co2 emission are concerned .
in individual case , we may also need state aid for this .
we need to ensure that we work together to develop this sector further .
( ro ) maritime transport is becoming extremely important for the european union .
the european maritime sector is facing an ever-growing shortage of qualified seafarer .
by the summer , we could come out with this .
i should like to refer to three specific question .
i can not give any precise timeline but we are working on it .
first of all , the environment , which is crucial .
i wonder whether the commission might like to consider that idea again .
such a concept is a reward for good environmental behaviour .
that way , you actually combine a system of incentive and disincentive .
this give inspection an enormous boost and good behaviour is rewarded .
i have placed particular emphasis on shipbuilding and maintenance of ship .
we give our full backing to the atalanta mission against piracy .
it is a good mission and ha already proved a success .
the safety of the maritime sector is very important .
that is the huge task that we now have to face together .
this is something about which we should be careful during this project .
i would like to thank mr trüpel for an excellent report .
another prerequisite is that the member state become increasingly aware of their responsibility .
that is essential to ensure access to culture in the digital age .
again , this is just a start and let u go for it .
more can be done and more need to be done .
the site will be further developed in the year thereafter .
europeana , the european digital library , face many challenge today .
the success of this pan-european undertaking is far from being assured .
this practice obviously produce numerous mistake in the content posted there .
competition with google also spotlight numerous issue which will have to be resolved .
evaluation and assessment of the animal welfare action plan 2006-2010 ( short presentation )
they therefore need to be protected from unfair competition from third country .
i am not sure that one can do that .
this issue resonates differently in the various european country .
not all producer or consumer perceive the issue in the same way .
this is , therefore , a clear justification for the common agricultural policy .
at the moment , there are shortcoming in both of these area .
the question of transporting animal ha been raised here .
the action plan , adopted in 2006 , ha basically been a success .
our future strategy will have to make that clear .
agriculture is therefore part of the solution to the problem of climate change .
they need a strong european agriculture policy to support them .
ten per cent of greenhouse gas still originate from agriculture .
there need to be a reduction here , too .
that it something that we need to consider in future .
i am thinking of beneficial effect a well a adverse one .
mr president , i just want to mention my home .
the fight against climate change is an absolute priority globally .
we have a policy that limit greenhouse gas emission .
woman are among the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change .
they are currently defined on the basis of mainly or exclusively national criterion .
i would like to summarise what we are now proposing in this report .
i am not convinced that these are really the right criterion to use .
many part of it do not meet the need of disadvantaged region .
it is the commissioner whom i would like to address in particular .
we therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly .
we expect calculation and a more profound analysis of the effect .
an important question is how to maintain agricultural production in le favoured area .
i would like to address a couple of issue .
the importance of granting appropriate compensatory payment for le favoured area is indisputable .
it is clear that the agricultural industry need to change .
but what i have developed is two main theme .
it doe need to adopt a more flexible , lighter-touch approach .
this report set out a number of way that that can be achieved .
that must be possible and we must endeavour to achieve it .
this , however , is only a mean , not an end .
the goal is to fulfil all the task of the sectoral policy .
but simplification is an ongoing process ; work will continue in 2010 .
we should not just abolish it because we have not had any crisis .
the new system must be based on objective and fair criterion .
they are new change in relation to those we adopted yesterday at 17.30 .
in this way , the sitting on wednesday will close at 19.00 .
everything , apart from the plenary sitting , will be working a normal .
the rest will go ahead a normal on thursday .
we are going to want to get our parliamentary committee involved in this .
it may be that we will respond with a resolution .
the second important point is that safety come first .
this is , and remains , our fundamental concern .
we have to ensure the highest safety standard for our citizen .
this started this morning at 08.00 , through eurocontrol .
the model for resuming flight is the most important thing .
everyone share the view that the rule are good .
this model is intergovernmental and airspace is a national competence .
we can now think about how to modify the model .
to say that the european model completely failed is totally wrong .
this wa , and is , an extraordinary event .
we must also , of course , ass the consequence and outcome .
it is therefore extremely important that we coordinate this at a european level .
that is what i call on you to ensure .
i believe that we should be thinking about these people this morning .
however , many people are stranded in far-flung corner of the world .
i hope that it will be possible to get them home quickly .
it is important that we now acknowledge this fact once again .
to a certain extent , we have been taught a lesson .
many of the citizen of europe were annoyed about this .
on this occasion , nature itself played the decisive role .
we must take a lesson from this for the future .
the human race is not omnipotent and never will be .
either the airspace is safe or it is not .
this put the airline ' temporary loss of income into perspective .
the volcanic eruption in iceland should be a warning to all of u .
what we are now experiencing is the reality of the future of transport .
too much money and too many job are at stake .
it is right that some part of the airspace should be reopened today .
what doe 'at their own risk ' actually mean in this case ?
we will be talking later about employment in the european union .
this monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping .
we are all highly aware of the serious financial consequence .
however , a human life is worth much more than good .
in my opinion , the top priority is the safety of passenger .
for this reason , we must be extremely cautious .
aid is needed , but not only at a national level .
justifiably , we have discussed this subject often in parliament .
for me , the future lie in the single european sky .
let u see how we can really integrate safety and efficiency with that .
well , give europe those power , at long last !
so , we need to make preparation for the year to come .
i also believe that diversity of transport and mode of transport is important .
( da ) mr president , i have two important point to make .
it remains to be decided whether or not airline will be financially compensated .
the outcome will be decided by the debate in the day ahead .
it is good to hear that there is now a three-step plan .
i hope that we here in parliament will immediately reject that model .
the cost to airline go beyond their lost revenue .
is state aid through national budget the best solution ?
are any other option being considered by the european commission ?
however , the situation on the railway remains appalling .
they also need to have immediate effect that everyone can see .
at least , that is the way the public perceives it .
long-term prognosis , not decision by knee-jerk bulletin , is what is required .
one of the biggest problem facing the passenger today is the confusion ...
we know we must reduce that dependency in the year to come .
finally , plan to reduce unnecessary travel should be welcomed .
that is clearly one area where parliament could lead by example .
an inadequate response may be justified in such case , but only once .
the information about the eruption 's consequence wa inadequate .
i believe that member state should understand something about what ha happened now .
firstly , a regard the ban on flight and coordination .
that is a matter for the competent national authority .
we are dealing with exceptional circumstance here , of course .
we clearly have to learn from this situation and take appropriate measure .
in my opinion , it all took too long .
mr kallas , you have said that the national authority have responsibility .
we need more europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy .
the treaty of lisbon open up more opportunity for u .
must these test flight be carried out by civil aviation and the airline ?
so far , however , only isolated and national initiative have been taken .
the work done at european and national level wa not sufficient .
they have acted according to the principle that safety is paramount .
we can discus whether the ash cloud should have been investigated more quickly .
i wa called yesterday by three people who are in this situation .
they have already spent a whole week at the airport .
the directive on package travel will probably be reviewed .
the experience we are gaining is too expensive , but is very instructive .
thirdly , efficient transport is the lifeblood of the economy .
this must not be exclusively for member state to decide .
secondly , we need to think about the question of economic responsibility .
it is greater than that of refinery and steel work ...
what we have experienced is something we will experience again .
we want passenger from europe to be transported safely .
we want safety , but we also want transport option .
i believe that we need all the mean of transport currently available .
we need aircraft , a we can not replace flying with another solution .
i call on the european union , therefore , to pull itself together .
therefore , improving scientific test and also coordination at the level ...
no so-called 'responsible ' party dare shoulder their responsibility any longer .
hey presto , thousand of people are invited to be vaccinated .
i repeat , mr speroni , mr ferreira , the action wa immediate .
on friday , it became apparent that a serious situation wa setting in .
we are therefore calling for their right to free movement to be respected .
everyone from the european parliament who spoke before you raised these matter .
yesterday , we discussed it with the council of minister a well .
a regard passenger ' right , the rule are very clear .
some member asked about the rule and whether we should revisit them .
it is clear what must be done concerning passenger ' right today .
it is the same dilemma : safety versus flexibility .
we said that passenger ' right should be taken very seriously .
it is still a difficult situation and we must deal with the consequence .
we will have several opportunity to discus this matter further .
it is very important that they have listened to your remark .
there wa also a lack of coordination between air and ground transport .
i welcome the commission 's decisive crisis management step .
we do not usually think about the huge significance of air transport .
until now , many still can not admit that they feel protected .
it is this to which i would like to draw your attention .
it wa faster , safer and more convenient for passenger .
i hope that the single european sky will become a reality one day .
in my view , the session must be held a normal .
commission legislative and work programme for 2010 ( debate )
it ha not been easy for any of u to get to strasbourg .
so there are some quite new rule for this part-session .
this programme is the direct outcome of our political dialogue .
this being so , it provides a solid platform for achieving ambitious result .
we all know that the collective interest of europe is at stake here .
the protection of ordinary consumer of financial service will receive special attention .
at european level , our action must have genuine european added-value .
we must seize every opportunity to encourage employment and social cohesion .
we sent the detail to you even before acceptance .
this wa the case in hungary , this wa the case in greece .
the commission ought to exercise it competence in this regard .
i am not saying that the commission is to blame for these crisis .
now let u move on to what the commission should do .
it should place citizen at the centre of our work .
job , job , job must be our guiding principle .
unfortunately , i can not say the same thing about my fellow member .
how can we ensure that this happens in an era of budgetary consolidation ?
it go without saying that we must consolidate our budget .
we discussed this earlier on this morning with mr kallas .
we have invested too little , for example , in the trans-european network .
mr barroso , you referred to the monti report .
in this context , public service in particular are very important to u .
you have agreed to submit proposal for a framework directive .
i would now like to come to my final and decisive point .
we need the commission to call for these thing with a powerful voice .
why do government have to keep their statistic and their budget procedure secret ?
of course , government must have a certain freedom .
this is why the commission must have a powerful voice .
however , we must both fight for a strong europe .
i can not see any such project in this programme today .
we urgently need budgetary , economic and industrial coordination .
i am thinking in particular of the issue of corporate taxation .
even the introduction ha the title 'a new era ' .
it is clear that our response to the greek situation ha been inadequate .
the group in parliament have also asked you about this .
this mean that you are already breaking one of your major promise .
i hope that they will set more ambitious objective .
we therefore welcome the new direction which ha been developed by president barroso .
this must be the overriding priority defining the commission .
the commission must be their ally , not their adversary .
we do not , of course , like everything .
why , though , is it time to act ?
when will we have the european credit rating agency ?
another important element for the competitiveness of business is the international trade situation .
there is no doubt that ageing population are a concern in many country .
however , we must examine why the problem occurred .
distinctive culture are made by distinctive people and not the other way round .
europe is slowly but steadily being ethnically cleansed of european .
subsidiarity mean deciding which level of decision making is best .
the decision wa taken by each european national regulator .
there are different level of responsibility : national level and european level .
thank you very much , mr barroso , for your statement .
what are the real chance for people to enter the labour market ?
it is right that europe must respond jointly to the crisis .
the commission work programme for 2010 ha established the right priority .
we need to be laying the foundation for this now .
the strength of the programme is it measure for combating the crisis .
we have been working on the phenomenon of violence against woman for year .
unfortunately , there are no specific detail of any kind about this .
they have to be given at the meeting of the council in june .
this must be a process , and not electioneering .
only then will the result of referendum not be a surprise .
coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in haiti ( debate )
we are paying very close attention to the pre-positioning of relief stock .
most of them were completely depleted after the earthquake .
the dominican republic matter also and is not forgotten in our recovery programme .
that , of course , lead to work on reconstruction .
last but not least , we are very focused on result .
the new york conference took place in a very good spirit .
the world bank ha done excellent work on this .
the haitian ambassador attended when i launched that particular book .
the third point i want to make is this .
again , i thank both commissioner for their presentation .
what will remain of that conference when everything ha been forgotten ?
in other word , we need to mobilise support in haiti itself .
i understand that housing and education are the priority of the european commission .
i wish you every success and , above all , god 's help .
a president préval say , reconstruction must be carried out more effectively .
obviously , an earthquake caused the disaster in haiti .
this will be a long process , in my view .
it can be set up quickly before the next disaster .
i call on you now to stop talking about coordination and to act .
not even the experience of several rescue group wa sufficient .
good intention also require a practical side in order to be effective .
we need to stick to the pledge we are making now .
this ha been very useful and very encouraging for u .
let me turn to four question that have been posed .
they do not want to move for a variety of reason .
let me finish with the question of long-term sustainability .
it is governance sustainability , it is also ecological sustainability .
we are thinking in the long term when we think of chile .
we are working on the same base and on well-prepared ground .
i believe that the same is also very true for other participant .
the risk could definitely come from ownership of the political process .
i believe that this can be put in place and could be successful .
there are many more people still working and trying to do their best .
( the sitting wa suspended at 13.10 and resumed at 15.05 )
how wa the eu represented in foreign policy term ?
some member state launched individual aid campaign and others acted jointly .
baroness ashton should have been responsible for ensuring better coordination .
in addition , the government of haiti ha not been sufficiently involved .
meanwhile , international commentator are criticising our uncoordinated action .
let u do more to make up for this now .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question hour with the president of the commission .
question on any subject on behalf of political group .
this reading is therefore quite surprising , but it is indeed happening .
the treaty doe not say that it is forbidden to take on debt .
i am not here to reply on behalf of mr merkel .
i am here to reply on behalf of the commission .
let u also be clear from the point of view of the commission .
naturally , we have been very cautious on that point .
i would like to ask another question about acta .
you have been negotiating the acta agreement against piracy and counterfeiting since 2008 .
parliament is every bit a important a a large company .
you spoke about the coming into force of the treaty of lisbon .
i also want to hear the social partner ' view .
this is a very difficult issue and an extremely sensitive one .
you have said that you want to follow up on the critical remark .
i would also be interested to hear the answer to another question .
do you think that we and the commission have done enough ?
i think the commission proposal were the right one .
for instance , i am supporting the idea of a bank levy .
i think that should be a matter for the g20 .
so , a always , it is a question of balance .
on the contrary : it aim at building trust .
the financial sector need this kind of credibility to finance the economy .
president of the commission . - i do not agree .
it should be kept , of course , in the community method .
the treaty strike a balance and that balance ha to be respected .
the cost of the finished product from china is eur 5.50 .
i know that protectionist measure are undesirable , but what is the answer ?
that said , there were some measure that were taken specifically for employment .
in 2009 , 2.7 million people in the euro area lost their job .
for young people , unemployment is particularly worrying , a you said .
we have more than 20 % of young people unemployed in europe .
that is why we have launched three initiative for this year .
last week , the european climate foundation launched it 'roadmap 2050 ' .
but it can only be done at european level .
however , most of these initiative come from the u .
i worked in a very loyal manner with him .
i did everything to be present at his funeral .
it wa no longer possible for me to go .
our air quality directive provide for significant restriction in this respect .
it happened and now we have to react to it consequence .
the other 99 % is in the hand of the member state .
do you not think that we should also emphasise the development of micro-entities ?
hence , in this context , these question would appear to be justified .
this is just one of many example of job being lost in europe .
your work programme doe not provide very definitive information in this respect .
you have just referred to the guideline and the europe 2020 position paper .
in my view , this is not specific enough .
a you have said , 20 % of young people are unemployed .
this would therefore require a large amount of labour migration .
in my opinion , there is something of a contradiction here .
our society will always pay a big price for exclusion .
there is a lot to do in this area .
i believe that pension reform are also a way of contributing to that .
we know the unemployment rate in this social group is currently very high .
( de ) mr barroso , i have to disagree with you .
why doe this not form part of europe 2020 ?
thank you , colleague , for being active during the last hour .
we will also meet next month during question hour with president barroso .
the eu strategy for relation with latin america ( debate )
this summit is not , however , just another summit , mr ashton .
i would like to begin by thanking mr salafranca for his excellent report .
a the report rightly point out , the partnership ha been a success .
i am pleased we have taken a number of initiative since then .
these are important negotiation and dialogue . they strengthen our relationship .
there is also much that we can do in practice on regional integration .
the minimum environmental and social standard must be respected .
the free trade agreement with peru and colombia are a very poor counterexample .
i do , however , admit that we have succeeded in some aspect .
i would like to end with a specific question to mr ashton :
there are also legal proceeding under way in brazil .
so , we need genuine cooperation and support in that .
i think that this is a very important report .
however , lady and gentleman , we need to help latin america .
we always need to keep this vision in mind .
let u join together with them so that we can be stronger .
we have made a great deal of progress since 1999 .
however , the actual condition in the two continent are very different .
fortunately , we do not have a many problem .
in march , we discussed here the situation in cuba .
baroness , i would urge you please to answer my following question .
however , it is a fact that these principle are often violated .
in addition , around 42 million people in latin america are illiterate .
i think that this is what we should retain from today 's report .
if only everyone really did live in such condition .
we learned this first hand from senator piedad córdoba .
it enables u to reinforce that relationship that honourable member have talked about .
we are continuing to follow the situation very closely .
we have taken note of the significant progress that ha been made .
member state have ratified the un convention on the law of the sea .
we should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region .
to end - again , my congratulation go to mr salafranca .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in may .
all side need to be careful and avoid provocation .
the restoration of law and order must be a priority .
the second issue concern the legitimacy of the provisional government .
we will be happy to look at such a plan .
the early indication - i can tell honourable member - are encouraging .
thirdly , it is clear that kyrgyzstan need material assistance .
these event can not simply be put on one side .
similar condition can also be found in other country .
however , the situation in kazakhstan is also far from ideal .
the same thing also applies to uzbekistan and to other country .
this is a very sensitive region , a mr brok ha already said .
this is not only about the energy supply from turkmenistan through to kazakhstan .
the european union must exert significance influence in this case .
i hope the council will begin work on this next monday .
my question is : how do you intend to tackle this ?
the tulip revolution in 2005 once again raised immense hope .
it must not be the playing field of certain major power .
this is now a matter of the utmost urgency .
similarly , ethnic-based grouping appear , creating fear of more ethnic violence .
large number of weapon are being circulated and robbery are taking place .
the present interim government is unable to counter any of these threat .
the situation is completely unclear for the local people .
( ro ) the situation in kyrgyzstan is giving particular cause for concern .
this country ha a strategic position in central asia .
the authority must take measure aimed at protecting civilian life .
amnesty international ha also called our attention to their plight .
two reason can , of course , be given .
over 80 fatality is a bad signal for the building of kyrgyzstan .
we are not in haiti , but in kyrgyzstan .
let u at least try to get there in time on this occasion .
european foreign policy should help to defuse the situation .
it is essential to provide intelligent , targeted economic and development aid .
it is essential that our different country be heavily involved in this project .
we have a duty of recognition and reparation towards it people .
we are working very closely with the un and with the osce .
those are just some of the element that i would include .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in may .
no one is in any doubt that kyrgyzstan play a special role here .
we must not allow civil war to break out .
we must know what the plan of the interim government there are .
it is on that basis that we cooperate to protect our common interest .
our aim is to have a focused , business-like summit .
the summit should also address the subject of reciprocal visa-free travel .
haiti will also be on the agenda of the summit for obvious reason .
canada is among the most important the european union ha .
we aim for a productive summit with clear result .
there are also sensitive issue which will be touched on at the summit .
despite this , we are faced with a number of serious challenge .
firstly , we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly .
we have very similar objective with regard to climate policy .
we hope to be able to agree on joint standard for reduction .
this new legal basis must ensure that civil right are respected .
there is no mention of protecting the arctic using target and standard .
such a development would be ominous for canadian worker ' pay and condition .
now , canadian water is a particular target of the water multinationals .
is the eu apparatus too cumbersome and bureaucratic to deal with this task ?
a route north of america must be freely available to all , however .
it improves the competitiveness of all the country of the northern hemisphere .
it seems that the ceta refers to significant privatisation , deregulation and restructuring .
the second point that i would like to make is a follows .
more than half of this number - 22 million - are romanian .
european citizen ' freedom of movement must be treated on a uniform basis .
the visa issue affect the relationship between the european union and canada .
president barroso called at the previous summit for a resolution of this matter .
i do not understand why canada take different approach .
the production of tar sand is the main cause .
i firmly believe that we must stop dragging our foot .
two important subject have been raised in this discussion .
the one-sided visa rule for czech citizen are unacceptable and should be abolished .
in this context , they are therefore expecting real help from the eu .
we ended up coming out looking incoherent , disorganised and weak .
the environment commissioner ha said that this must never happen again .
however , it is important for u to find a middle way .
the council ha not yet received any notification in this regard .
of particular concern is the tar sand industry , a mr arsenis mentioned .
we are right to go for an ambitious trade agreement .
however , we should be very ambitious on both side .
there is a very clear and key role for parliament there .
all i would add to that are two thing .
one is that a good trade agreement actually benefit our citizen .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in may .
more than half of this number , 22 million , are romanian .
this is one of the reason for a large number of visa application .
τhe next item is question time ( b7-0207/2010/rev . 1 ) .
i am not going to jump to conclusion about what happened .
( de ) mr president , thank you for the excellent report .
i have not taken up a position on this subject .
however , there will be no related debate in plenary .
it would appear that , under these circumstance , consumer choice is limited .
the commission is closely monitoring development in the greek banking sector .
( el ) mr president , i thank the commissioner for his reply .
obviously , there are problem with the bank in greece .
will we adopt a 'wait and see ' approach ?
then you can , of course , discus it with him directly .
but i am quite positive about ireland and their investment level .
but , sometimes , i count my blessing and also my past experience .
i know what 100 megabyte are , but what can i imagine ?
firstly , will the commission attempt to encourage sweden to fulfil it obligation ?
the immediate impact of this cyclicity is a reduction in state revenue .
at the most productive age , from 25-34 , unemployment is 14.6 % .
on behalf of mr kósa , i would like to add a remark .
are development in the cypriot economy and it indicator a cause for concern ?
i have other engagement so i can not stay .
if you have no time , walk out that door now .
i should have the courtesy of a reply in this house .
i respect the authority of the president in parliament .
nevertheless , question time is scheduled until 8.30 on our agenda .
the programme spell out the medium-term budgetary strategy until 2013 .
subject : greece and the current crisis in euro cooperation
greece is revealing the other side of euro cooperation at the moment .
generally speaking , fluctuating exchange rate are not a good thing .
adjustment in the euro area ha not been sufficiently smooth in the past .
there is no longer such a thing a a greek currency .
how could such a fund operate in practical term ?
consistency with the stability-oriented governance framework of the emu need to be ensured .
the commission is considering the scope of proposal to this effect .
first of all , can i apologise to the commissioner .
are we talking half-way through the lifetime of this commission ?
doe it intend to table proposal to strengthen economic convergence in the eurozone ?
the commitment to consolidation need to become stronger in good time .
the commission will ensure the efficient articulation between the two framework .
there is a very big imbalance with respect to competitiveness .
that is why we are proposing a new scheme for that .
establishment of a european asylum support office ( debate )
specific task are already being assigned to it via other legislation .
however , we have not yet taken it a step further .
in practical term , this voluntary solidarity is empty talk .
nevertheless , europe ha a huge responsibility where asylum is concerned .
we all know that it doe nothing of the sort .
it ha been said that in sweden , thing are going very well .
establishing this agency is another step towards centralising eu asylum policy .
there are , of course , other criticism that can be made .
any common european asylum policy threatens british sovereignty over border control .
the commission doe not offer help and support when the uk is struggling .
where is the money to help the british taxpayer afford all this ?
the vote will take place during the part-session in the first week of may
mr krehl , who is replacing mr kirilov , ha the floor .
therefore , i would like to read out his note .
they are in english , which is very surprising for a bulgarian member .
they are a logical continuation of the document which we adopted last year .
this also mean improved implementation and correct spending on eu money .
the second group of amendment concern financial management rule .
all measure will commit realisation of more project , especially now .
in addition , we want to help to overcome the crisis .
we urgently need to speed up the implementation of these programme .
a we have said , both flexibility and solidarity are required .
therefore , we are against raising the evaluation threshold .
we believe that it is not possible to justify this to european taxpayer .
( nl ) mr president , i have a question for mr schroedter .
in her analysis , she ha chosen to take a rather negative approach .
why is she painting such a negative picture today ?
there is no reason for bringing all that negativity to this proposal today .
sweeping change are not even possible at the moment .
we can only manage a gradual modernisation of the existing system .
the compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it .
in addition , unemployment also play a major role independently of the crisis .
i assume that my colleague thought the same thing .
when i looked at the commission 's overall initiative , i wa thrilled .
( nl ) mr president , exceptional time call for exceptional measure .
that is the scheme we have operated for 2007 .
why can we not repeat this scheme in 2008 and 2009 ?
to conclude , we could also show some solidarity .
that would be showing real solidarity , but unfortunately it ha not happened .
i therefore feel reasonably positive , at least towards the rapporteur .
these monies have primarily been used to help combat youth and long-term unemployment .
the overall budget of this programme is eur 1.36 billion .
we need to ensure that relaxing the cofinance criterion doe not reduce accountability .
i am pleased that mr hahn and mr cioloş are here .
therefore , cohesion policy should not be weakened , but strengthened instead .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the job he ha done .
how long will it take u to have the capability to respond ?
the commission presented the first draft a long ago a july last year .
the whole legislative process ha taken nine month up to today .
the commission 's initial proposal date from june 2009 .
however , i would like to express my disappointment once again .
now let u turn to the future for a moment .
mr kirilov 's report is a good example of this .
i would also like to say that this effort must be continuous .
cohesion policy also form a very important part of the europe 2020 strategy .
the kirilov report is a first step towards this simplification .
i hope that this report will be only a first step .
i would say that this is a european insight .
there are also control mechanism at local and national level .
instead , they must be committed to using the fund that are available .
i would like to highlight two point once again .
this is not about handing out charity to poor region .
in other word , it is not simply an act of general solidarity .
the vote will take place during the part-session in the first week of may
i support the proposal aimed at simplifying the procedure for accessing european fund .
the european union 's cohesion policy play an essential role in this regard .
nonetheless , accessing european funding remains difficult for a number of potential beneficiary .
nobody complains when price are rising , especially not farmer .
this crisis ha affected the dairy sector in particular .
this decision , then , wa taken last year .
the member state have until june to distribute these fund .
secondly , there are support measure that will be reaching producer soon .
those , then , are the measure that have already been taken .
there were hardly any market intervention and farmer had stable , rising income .
these include , in particular , strengthening the legal position of producer group .
the amendment wa rejected by almost 250 vote to 350 .
you said that in the future , we would consider a regulation .
in the dairy sector , a fundamental change in policy is needed .
we are currently faced by a crazy process of concentration in agriculture .
they are the weakest link in the business chain .
no one will tell u how and when to regulate our market .
we should not exclude this from the discussion right at the outset .
we must finally put an end to this process .
there ha been a significant drop in the price of basic agricultural product .
it produce public good and it need public european financial support .
it is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation .
this year , olive producer have been paid eur 30 per hundred kilogram .
there is clearly a need to introduce more control .
in the financial year 2008-2009 , the overall situation deteriorated significantly .
i can assure you that we are currently working on this .
the market must be able to function , of course .
the effect on price during the recent dairy crisis is just one example .
but we are not out of the wood yet , so to speak .
supermarket present their hurdle when it come to a fair deal for farmer .
the most difficult situation wa definitely that facing the dairy market .
we can already imagine what will happen when these instrument expire .
we can certainly expect further fall in income and market turbulence .
the next sitting will take place tomorrow , 21 april .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
do we also have an explanation for the council 's absence ?
colleague , it is not necessary for the council to be here .
therefore , i object to the council 's absence today .
what is important is that we can start our work .
i know many of the honourable member of this house from the committee .
discharge to the european institution come at a difficult , but important moment .
these action must be highly effective , even under the most difficult circumstance .
i thank you and look forward to your comment .
in addition , this is a crucial time in institutional term .
this is all good news , lady and gentleman .
we have managed to use 100 % green electricity .
a critical approach is essential , a i have said .
i wanted to show that we can do even better .
the situation is analogous to the one from last year .
we are pleased to note the opening of the internal audit unit .
we note that the european ombudsman ha greatly increased it number of post .
to sum up , there is only a problem with the council .
there are no problem with the other six institution .
the court of auditor and the council were not present during our discussion .
it is not only a formality but a very important moment .
it is therefore not the first time ; let u not be hypocritical .
a regard the debate , i am in favour of it going ahead .
i will , today , find a solution to this for the future .
the situation is different for the european police college ( cepol ) .
that is why we are proposing that discharge be postponed .
the 2008 discharge procedure is now reaching it end .
i believe this ha been clearly demonstrated in our recent effort .
in retrospect , the continued underfunding of category iv is clear .
actually , i wanted to make a completely different speech .
the only institution that ha to take it seriously is the commission .
the only other institution that is represented is parliament .
therefore , we must consider the discharge procedure itself very thoroughly .
we can not go on a we have up to now .
we expect the immediate legalisation of this state of affair in budgetary legislation .
for spouse , it mean it is impossible to become self-employed in sweden .
there are also enormous difficulty in getting a job .
in any case , the situation is untenable ... .
mr president , another point concern actual custom check by member state .
at the same time , discharge is also a political evaluation .
certain member state did not even reach 32 % .
clearly , this raise various problem in the budget process a well .
we need to use eu money a a seed to grow local solution .
aid , malaria and tb still claim some four million life a year .
we have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world .
i am interested in seeing whether we have met those target .
these young people are every bit a capable a young people everywhere .
that is why parliament , commission and council agreed to those target .
therefore , it is important that the council is present .
in this way , we can make sure there are no scandal .
it is extremely important to prevent this from happening .
we are not talking about parliament 's money , but taxpayer ' money .
we will return to these in next year 's report .
institutional independence is an important guarantee of a properly functioning internal control system .
we rejected all proposal that would reduce the political group ' independence .
incidentally , i am pleased that the council is still here .
i am at a loss to understand why they persist in obstructing this .
my final point concern mutual relation between the council and parliament .
i shall have another opportunity to do that later .
commissioner šemeta , i would ask you to address this in your reply .
the council will say : fair enough , but there are practical objection .
yet this is no problem , lady and gentleman .
together with mr geier , i have tabled a number of deleting amendment .
i commend the commission for the improvement they have made .
however , a great deal need to be done .
in some area , there ha even been some progress compared with 2007 .
we must therefore use the discharge to push through such change .
such pressure must also be exerted on the council .
today , we have to state that these change have not taken place .
we must therefore ask the council the obvious question .
the council is happy to answer informally , off the record .
our criticism of the council and the commission is clear .
it is shared by many of our fellow member in other political group .
we therefore also support the re-insertion of the critical passage .
the auditor ' report for 2008 only clear 10 % of the budget .
the rest is affected by different level of error .
we should be making the decision on discharge in view of this .
are we being serious about our responsibility or are we playing politics here ?
is discharge an interinstitutional game , a ha been said in the past ?
he ha just the same freedom to speak a you do .
5 ) a reduction in the member of the administrative board .
i wa not formally invited by parliament to attend this debate .
thank you very much for so kindly complying with our request .
in this respect , i should like to thank you again very much .
the fact is , we do not have a clue .
you spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop .
we share his criticism and that of the other group .
however , our criticism , i agree , ha no real consequence .
a mr audy ha pointed out , we must develop our tool .
( de ) thank you , mr president , that wa very kind .
i would first like to thank all the rapporteur for their effort .
however , i see light and shadow in the report .
whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether .
there is shadow in the area of cohesion policy .
this is not acceptable and we must deal with it .
we must ensure transparency , here and in the council .
i can tell parliament that the british conservative will not accept these irregularity .
firstly , there is often the problem of budget support .
self-criticism is good , but it should then be accurate .
our motto should be not to waste a single cent .
we here in parliament have a particular responsibility in this respect .
allow me to give a very clear example : eu aid to eritrea .
they have languished in appalling prison condition for year .
they have criticised the country 's leadership and president .
i believe this is what the taxpayer of europe would expect of u .
i am very pleased that the discharge report have taken up this topic .
he can not come due to the well-publicised transport problem .
these were mentioned by parliament and the court of auditor .
the cause of these shortcoming are both objective and subjective .
the main problem arose with the european police college cepol .
yet here we are talking about eur 4.8 million up to 2013 .
at first , a sense of helplessness predominated in the committee .
here , we have the beginning of a compromise .
that is , after all , one and the same topic .
that is , of course , a good thing .
having said that , there is still room for improvement .
instead , we should ensure that we have only one seat .
it also put u in a better position to criticise the other institution .
our court of auditor is currently unable to do this .
the latest special report by the court of auditor reveals major problem .
fund were not spent effectively and were not sufficiently evaluated .
this also includes the new european asylum support office .
it is also about u handling european citizen ' tax money properly .
i would also like to thank you for a very good discussion today .
i think that this will give u result in the future .
this is an important message to convey to citizen of the eu .
deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go .
i will remind everyone that a year ago , it wa the same .
i think i proposed such an oral amendment at the vote in may .
we need to think very seriously about this , mr president .
the vote will take place during the may part-session .
we can not be hard enough on ourselves in this regard .
wherever there are people working together , thing will go wrong .
even the strictest internal control can not prevent that .
the abuse that existed have now been virtually eliminated .
( the sitting wa suspended at 12.00 and resumed at 15.00 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the council and commission statement on swift .
that , moreover , is precisely what european legislation permit .
a a result , we have a detailed draft mandate from the commission .
i recently met u home secretary napolitano and we addressed this issue .
data will be processed only for the purpose of terrorism .
the commission is willing to participate in these discussion with member state .
the mandate call for a five-year retention period for non-extracted data .
it take into account the concern of parliament raised in your resolution .
this is what we shall be discussing today in this chamber .
after the vote in february , two clear lesson were learnt .
what exactly do we , here in europe , want for ourselves ?
we are keen to do that in a constructive manner .
i would like to make one other preliminary remark .
i do not think we can treat our own decision like that .
the mandate doe not offer a solution here either .
the transmission of information to third country must be regulated with clear directive .
finally , i have another specific question for the council and the commission .
now , my question is , what doe that mean ?
it mark a huge departure from eu legislation and practice .
it must therefore be ensured that there is no bulk transfer of data .
otherwise , parliament will remain unable to agree to a tftp agreement .
the united state maintains an almost invisible lobbying presence in the parliament .
a mr sippel said , quality must take precedence over quantity .
we want a good agreement and we want this agreement very soon .
these are the matter we need to negotiate on now .
help u negotiate and together , we will bring about a good result .
i think it is important to state this , before going any further .
mr president , clearly , the commission ha listened .
i want to say something on process and something on context .
i would like to thank ambassador bill kennard in that regard .
it is an absolute and multidimensional superpower - cultural , military and economic .
i think such political will should be present here .
such an agreement mix together innocent citizen with those who may be guilty .
it is claimed that there are technical problem inherent in this .
the reason for the refusal were clearly listed and they include in particular :
outside this framework , it will not be possible to obtain our consent .
the european parliament will be consistent with the position it ha always held .
the council and the commission must inform the european parliament comprehensively and directly .
also , will the united state really do the same for u ?
( de ) mr president , thank you , commissioner malmström .
respect among partner , respect for citizen and respect for european legislation .
i am confident that the commission will resolve this in a sensible manner .
we have barely two month and one week to begin negotiation with washington .
the european commission is not very flexible in this area .
i am pleased to hear that the commission agrees with this .
it is imperative that we have the most appropriate safeguard .
however , what can we ask for in return ?
that is why several question need to be asked .
the previous agreement stipulated a maximum period of 90 year .
i should like the council and the commission to answer these question .
european citizen will also have somewhere to submit complaint about any abuse .
it is up to parliament to make this one of it prerogative .
therefore we are in favour of the transfer of specific data .
however , the transfer of aggregate data is certainly going overboard .
unfortunately , the council presidency wa conspicuous by it absence .
there is , of course , an intermediate position .
population group associated with terrorism at a particular time could be targeted .
targeting is viewed with distaste and condemned a discriminatory .
is there a time limit to this bilateral agreement ?
we can not do this by trampling on human right , however .
if this happens , then we will have helped the terrorist .
it is our credibility that is at stake here .
i am grateful that she ha said so publicly .
the retention period for data ha also been mentioned .
there will be absolute reciprocity with regard to the united state .
the eu review team will also have access to this information .
there ha to be a suspected terrorist that can only be searched .
the american have shown a very open attitude so far .
it need to be explored in depth within europe .
of course , that will not be part of the negotiation .
it will be a difficult negotiation and we need the time .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in may .
i would like to highlight three item in it .
these , i believe , are three important principle .
they use such data to combat terrorism and other serious crime .
in your resolution , you also refer to the pnr agreement with canada .
i am looking forward to working further with you on these issue .
i will go into the detail once more shortly .
however , unlike swift , there were definitely good reason for this postponement .
originally , it wa always said that it wa about combating terrorism .
now however , it is also about serious crime .
however , we must go into great detail here .
officially , we still do not have these result yet .
it is very important to create a uniform agreement .
we specifically need to look at api data and esta in this context .
that is something completely different and we need to distinguish very carefully .
any use of pnr must be in line with eu data protection standard .
i do not know whether you have ever seen the film minority report .
if not , then i would recommend that you watch it .
then the chief investigator himself is targeted and the house of card collapse .
i would not like our debate to be a debate about cinema .
this can be a matter of life and death for these people .
( mt ) i would like to make three brief comment .
this is something that we would do well to emphasise .
in my opinion , it is very important indeed .
just about everyone will travel by air sooner or later .
we need disclosure regulation like the usa 's privacy act .
the way to legal action must likewise stand open to them .
i believe that we already know who pose a threat .
unfortunately , this proposal wa not taken up by the european interior minister .
i hope now that we will soon be able to fly safely again .
still le do i want to see our fundamental privacy right being violated .
therefore , a definition of the term 'serious crime ' is vital .
that is what mr fayot mentioned : what measure ought to be adopted ?
i think the debate we had on swift may clarify matter .
lastly , my third comment is connected with the previous one .
i think it is a very balanced and wise resolution .
the vote will take place during the first part-session in may .
ban on use of cyanide mining technology ( debate )
i would mention just the decision regarding biodiversity or the water framework directive .
are there any mining technology that endanger our water and our environment ?
yet this is the result of this obsolete technology .
the time is ripe , distinguished fellow member , to take action .
let u not wait for a new catastrophe to warn u of this .
clear information requirement are included in the directive if trans-boundary impact are expected .
this is why resource efficiency is a priority for this commission .
a the commissioner ha correctly established , we have learned from this accident .
a great deal of poison will be released into the environment .
there are practice and experience from other country with tragic result .
one member referred earlier to mining programme being prepared at present in greece .
it get into the organism by inhalation through undamaged skin or after use .
at sufficient concentration , death follows in a few second or minute .
sometimes , there is human error and sometimes nature spring a surprise .
in november 2005 , meps and member state adopted the mining waste directive .
there are regulation , standard and norm in place to prevent accident .
the resolution mention 30 accident over the last 25 year .
the resolution only discus mining and , specifically , gold production .
we are aware of the legal measure which the european union ha adopted .
continuing to mobilise public opinion in europe is also part of our mission .
finland is a big gold producer by european standard .
i believe we need this change in attitude throughout europe .
i therefore really must ask for a long-term approach here .
however , banning these substance must not be viewed a the only solution .
toxic , hazardous substance are used in many industrial process other than mining .
however , their cause were similar : tailing pond which collapsed .
however , a we have heard , it is highly dangerous .
in the european union , we only have limited gold mining capacity .
the goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovation .
here , there is high technology , i know .
generally speaking , if chemical substance enter water , they destroy life .
every country in the world must do the same .
the subject before u is a very curious matter .
it reignites an accident that took place 10 year ago .
i am familiar with the geography of central europe .
it is therefore extremely important that the directive is duly implemented .
the vote will take place during the may i part-session .
i wish you a safe journey to your home .
the river somes had cyanide concentration 700 time above permitted level .
aquatic life wa completely destroyed over a distance of several hundred kilometre .
hazardous substance have no place in mining if we want to prevent disaster .
it is incumbent upon all of u to learn them .
i ask that this honourable house vote for our initiative .

mr president , i just think that it is important to ...
( for outcome of the vote and other detail : see minute )
mr president , lady and gentleman , i have heard mr schulz out .
the council ha consistently refused to enter into such an agreement .
( for outcome of the vote and other detail : see minute )
i welcome the adoption of this report in numerous respect .
i am pleased with the smooth functioning of the ecj .
that is why i voted for the report on the court of justice .
that is why i voted for the report on the european ombudsman .
that is essential for building people 's trust in public office holder .
i am surprised that the pension dispute ha not been resolved .
that is why i voted for the report on the european chemical agency .
that is why i voted for the report on the european environment agency .
that is why i voted for the report on the european medicine agency .
that is why i voted for the report on the european railway agency .
that is why i voted for the report on the european training foundation .
that is why i voted for the report on the euratom supply agency .
that is why i voted for the report on eurojust .
i would especially highlight the introduction of measure to improve performance assessment .
that is why i voted for the report on the sesar joint undertaking .
for these reason , i voted in favour of the report .
we voted for this report because of our opposition to this situation .
for these reason , this proposal is to be welcomed .
in writing . - i voted yes to the report .
i wa pleased to hear the result of today 's vote .
the priority project envisaged also include the curtici-braşov railway line .
in technical term , this proposal is one to codify the legal text .
the request for equal treatment for the outermost region must be heard .
these hand have a stranglehold on u , which we deplore .
it is hoped that intercommunication among member state will double by 2020 .
it is therefore important to ensure european cooperation and carefully select priority project .
the most important thing is passenger safety and protection .
the financial crisis ha had an impact on transport policy .
free movement of people and good is what defines the eu .
the amendment should lead to the application of so-called support threshold .
large project should also be protected from automatic decommitment .
economy are interconnected and the consequence of economic management cut both way .
the report take account of this and i therefore support it adoption .
these country are estonia , hungary , romania , latvia and lithuania .
the global financial crisis ha affected all of the eu member state .
i feel that the baltic state have suffered the most painful blow .
severe measure were taken because of the financial hurricane and job were lost .
since joining the eu , lithuania ha experienced a massive 'brain drain ' .
the treaty of lisbon clearly grant parliament new responsibility and new power .
in other case , there is just a change in legal basis .
i therefore support this house 's motion for a resolution .
the treaty of lisbon grant parliament new responsibility and new power .
in other case , there is just a change in legal basis .
i am therefore voting in favour of this resolution of the european parliament .
i voted in favour of the report on the power of legislative delegation .
the european union 's marine territory is the most extensive in the world .
the maritime transport sector face major challenge with regard to the environment .
that is why i am voting against this text .
the eu is the most significant global exporter and the second biggest importer .
the global financial crisis ha also affected the maritime transport sector .
the long-term competitiveness of european shipping is the cornerstone of eu maritime policy .
this applies both to lithuania and to the rest of europe .
this is a long-term task that requires close monitoring and measurable progress .
i therefore voted resolutely in favour of this ambitious project .
for this reason , i am in favour of the draft report .
in that respect , europeana is heir to the best european tradition .
all other country provide 5 % or le each .
an increased contribution by the member state is desirable .
only then can we talk about more financial resource .
this is particularly the case among new eu member state .
the project ha been endorsed by the polish librarian ' association .
an information campaign is needed to heighten awareness of europeana .
this is why i endorsed mr trüpel 's report .
i therefore refused to support this move on both form and content .
these are further reason why i voted for this report .
european standard in this area are some of the highest in the world .
i have two comment with regard to this report .
i therefore voted for this report because it respect these balance .
in writing . - i gave my full support to this report .
agriculture is dealt a double blow by climate change .
it is the first to suffer the increase in drought and natural disaster .
nitrogen fertiliser used by farmer are significant emitter of co2 .
methane from animal faeces is also a renewable source of energy .
moreover , european forest and soil are both incredible reservoir of co2 .
agriculture ha been and will remain the main source of food globally .
there will have to be a place for them in future agricultural policy .
we need to move towards more sustainable agriculture , which mean greater efficiency .
appropriate management of farm will result in carbon capture and greater food security .
this report support productivism and liberalism , which go against the general interest .
that depends on respect for human being and for our ecosystem .
all initiative that aim to reduce global warming are welcome .
it is therefore necessary to build on the sustainable aspect of agriculture .
clearly , european agriculture must play a major role in combating climate change .
in writing . - ( sv ) i voted against this report .
i voted in favour of stéphane le foll 's report .
i am resolutely confident that the cap will become more sustainable over time .
there need to be a thorough analysis of the economic benefit .
eu expansion had a great impact on eu agriculture .
support for less-favoured rural area constitutes an essential element of rural development policy .
i thank mr dorfmann and congratulate him on his excellent report .
achieving this objective will not be possible without close cooperation with member state .
smallholder in particular lack the staff to be able to remain competitive .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
of course , all measure must be based on an eu framework .
the reason for me taking this position is evident from the report .
the situation today is completely different and even more complicated .
the management of agricultural aid should be handled by the member state .
we are currently in the midst of a crisis for the euro .
a single agricultural policy is equally inappropriate for all 27 member state .
this is why we need to speed up the investment towards this .
this matter revolves around internet access for all citizen of the eu .
for all these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
a 'digital agenda ' is increasingly important and unavoidable in our society .
smes can act a the catalyst for economic recovery in europe .
the situation a regard pre-accession assistance for turkey is particularly serious and worrying .
a vote for discharge doe not mean that the situation is totally ideal .
that is why i voted for the report on the european police college .
i therefore clearly voted in favour of this report .
these are tragic situation which must never happen again .
the correction of this anachronistic and regrettable situation is urgent .
we therefore argue that the eu must improve it action at international level .
it also includes the creation of the europe-latin america and caribbean foundation .
moreover , it will bring it inhabitant increased security and prosperity .
in writing . - i abstained on the final vote on this report .
all in all , 10 out of the 16 green/efa amendment were adopted .
european union citizen must enjoy equal and fair treatment .
citizen of three eu member state still require visa to enter canada .
at the same time , canada 's asylum system need to be reviewed .
canada ha a history of partnership with the eu .
in writing . - the resolution wa carried with a large majority .
i strongly oppose this type of levy or tax on international transaction .
a system for protecting personal data must be implemented transparently and unequivocally .
we will protect the fundamental right of our fellow citizen all the way .
this agreement must be permanently on parliament 's radar .
the data transfer must be justified and take place in a transparent manner .
international legal cooperation and transatlantic cooperation are fundamental to the fight against terrorism .
to turn europe into a vassal of the united state is completely unacceptable .
that is why i hope that the discussion continue .
the union will not , however , endanger civil liberty and fundamental right .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the motion .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this resolution .
however , i voted against the draft resolution for a number of reason .
there is nothing to stop an accident such a this from happening again .
in europe there are several mining project using cyanide .
it is simply a matter of time and of human negligence .
high safety standard prevent the cyanide from having any impact on the environment .
cyanide is a highly toxic chemical used in gold mining .
it pose a serious threat to the environment and human health .
there is legislation in force which must be respected .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the final text .
this is standard practice in europe and minimises the risk of hazardous emission .
i therefore voted against the motion for a resolution .
we expect cooperation with the united state to take place on equal term .
there will also be ceremony to commemorate this event in luxembourg .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
i will begin with the calling of an intergovernmental conference .
consequently , mr president , there is no debate .
following lengthy discussion , my committee concluded that this is a fair position .
that is all this is about , but it is an important question .
this is what we are dealing with , but there is a problem .
it concern the question of who decides who these new member will be .
in 11 out of 12 country that is what ha happened .
however , at this point the treaty is at risk of collapsing .
such a convention would merely serve to waste time and taxpayer ' money .
we should be prudent with public money at all time .
my group will vote against this report because it disregard that important principle .
mr president , we disagree on many thing where the eu is concerned .
we doubtless also disagree on many thing where the european parliament is concerned .
i also think it is a very unfortunate development .
it is , of course , contrary to the treaty .
however , it is also contrary to what we actually do in practice .
( fr ) mr president , i shall come straight to the point .
it is not at all impossible to stick to the election .
it is a matter of detail that need to be clarified .
the ball is therefore back in the council 's court .
the méndez de vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process .
that would set a precedent and i am not happy to accept that .
madam president , i strongly disagree with the previous speaker .
let me thank íñigo and the coordinator for taking the decision .
it give much-needed reinforcement to the role of the european parliament .
we should not take so much time on administrative matter .
european citizen rightfully expect u to do our job efficiently and transparently .
this way we can do our job more efficiently .
citizen expect a quick resolution of this matter by the council .
i share the position presented on this matter by the rapporteur .
therefore , this revision of protocol ( no 36 ) is worthwhile .
next time we will be discussing possible change to the electoral vote .
that wa a mandate that already existed in the treaty of rome .
the vote will take place on thursday 6 may 2010 at 11.00 .
we must not force them to wait any longer .
all of our new fellow member should be chosen in democratic election .
let me address the financial support package for greece endorsed last sunday .
this is an unprecedented act of solidarity , unmatched anywhere in the world .
the commission will also manage the bilateral loan from the member state .
regrettably , not all market player seem convinced already .
we have to say loud and clear that the doubter are wrong .
i will come back to this in a moment .
there are three main building block to be considered .
second , interdependence : we are all in this together .
i also believe we need to look at the other cause of imbalance .
i see merit in creating a permanent mechanism for dealing with disruptive situation .
after all , it is better to be safe than sorry .
the responsibility shown by the government need to be matched by financial-market player .
we need responsible behaviour from all our market player .
we have already been doing a lot a regard financial market reform .
i count on this house to make this clear to all .
i would also like early agreement on effective new european supervisory arrangement .
they must not become detached from their economic and societal function .
the event of which mr barroso wa speaking took place today in greece .
we have high hope that the impasse in greece will be broken .
will we be able to ensure that it is heard loud and clear ?
will this argument be taken up by the commission ?
lady and gentleman , i am not an idealist .
european solidarity applies to every one of the 27 country .
what will we be able to do for our european citizen ?
i have , here , barry madlener a a speaker .
i will give you the floor in a few minute .
we can not continue to simply play a monitoring role .
the european union must play a part in the reform and support it .
we must learn to build and grow strong together .
thirdly , we must develop a new concept of european solidarity .
fourthly , we need to attach the necessary importance to the financial sphere .
this is therefore far more serious and more widespread .
it is clear that we have been drifting for four month .
those council member who are responsible should at least admit it !
they should say : 'we are to blame ! it is u !
how much time doe france need to reform pension ?
how much time doe germany need to build up pension ?
now , mr papandreou is being asked to change everything in three month .
the event currently taking place in greece prove it .
what must be created , however , is cohesion .
it must be created , it can not be decreed !
we can do it ; yes , we can .
i will say one thing : people are , nonetheless , hypocritical .
we are giving them money to buy our weapon .
this is my request to the commission : be a little fairer .
a eur 110 billion package is an enormous amount of money .
the question is whether or not greece will come out the other end .
we are now seeing strike , rebellion , rioting and so on .
this make the greek problem a european problem , our problem .
we must also rewrite the rule of the stability and growth pact .
it is providing neither stability nor , at present , economic growth .
suddenly we have a weak euro and a low growth rate .
however , the so-called rescue operation also ha some absurd element .
who will now pay the price for the political error ?
once again , dependent worker are to have to accept pay cut .
proposal for what could be done are on the table .
of course , greece must also do it homework .
mr cohn-bendit ha already spoken very convincingly about this .
i can understand people in athens going out into the street and protesting .
violence will achieve the opposite of what the protester and honest demonstrator want .
we must call for an end to the violence .
greece is one of them ; it is the tip of the iceberg .
immigration ha run riot whilst you have looked on and done nothing .
these people were killed by murderer , by criminal .
worker held a massive peace rally in athens today .
i would not like to get involved in a discussion about this .
it seems there are no limit for the leader of the euro area .
this decision must be changed at the next summit .
europe 2020 - new european strategy for job and growth ( debate )
this is the dual challenge contained in the europe 2020 strategy .
firstly , the structure of the europe 2020 strategy ha some integrated guideline .
secondly , we have the main target , which i referred to before .
it will have to be implemented and applied through the national reform programme .
it is important that europe present a coordinated approach to the g20 .
another objective will be driving on with financial market reform .
we should strive for a coordinated and strong approach .
it is going to be an extremely difficult debate .
we have had several occasion to debate them in this house .
even before we made a proposal , the commission consulted you about this .
better coordination of our economic policy is the centre-piece of europe 2020 .
this is clearly necessary in order to avoid future crisis .
the commission issued a proposal on the integrated guideline last week .
they reflect the priority of the europe 2020 strategy .
thus , thing must be done differently with the eu 2020 strategy .
parliament will challenge you to do so if need be .
we also have to look at where we want to go .
we can not consider that strategy without using the tool at our disposal .
if they are not clearly linked , we will go nowhere .
this is not about greece , or about any other member state .
we need real action , and we need it now .
that is why we are so tough on governance in parliamentary resolution .
we have decided on a set plan , new energy technology .
the existing legislation must be stepped up because it is not sufficient .
we need the promised energy efficiency action plan , promised for so long .
the council ha to be bolder and stop bickering .
our citizen have heard u declare that we are rescuing the bank .
in that regard , we have not made any progress for many year .
for me , climate is the second major issue .
what instrument and what incentive programme are to be used to do this ?
there is a great deal of work to be done on this programme .
mr barroso ha to manoeuvre artfully between these proposition .
i am not , of course , a free-market fanatic .
let u remember what happened to the service directive in this chamber .
there is also no doubt that we must help greece .
we must , therefore , show our solidarity with greece today .
otherwise , we will be heading for disaster with our eye wide open !
i feel he would have learned so much from me this evening !
will the proclaimed new strategy suffer a similar fate to it predecessor ?
that is the best european good governance we can have .
it is important to keep demand high and to stimulate investment .
secondly , we need to start changing into climate-smart society .
we need to , but we do not have the courage .
the commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard .
secondly , we should ensure that we have specific target for combating poverty .
some people say that they do not like the definition .
we need to link green investment to new job .
it is far more important than that , colleague .
you will receive that next week in conjunction with professor monti 's report .
let u see some fundamental change in here , both party .
many mistake and one defendant in the dock : the euro .
however , we will not actually do it , of course .
this is the aim of the europe 2020 strategy .
in 10 year ' time will we be more or le united ?
when i heard mr bloom , i wa really upset .
i see no other way to protect our job , our social system .
what we need is pragmatism , courage and decentralisation .
( el ) mr president , thank you very much .
we have to break the dictatorship of the market .
strategy came and went , and the economy collapsed .
those strategy failed to respect the basic rule of economic life .
europe 2020 must be an instrument to enable u to achieve our goal .
we should give our full support to mr rehn 's measure .
that is what we need , no more and no le .
i also fail to see a tangible desire to identify priority .
europe 's problem is it level of competitiveness in the global system .
climate protection ha certainly been tossed about many time .
this is still too vague - we need to make it legally binding .
secondly , this is capital investment in transport , energy and telecommunication infrastructure .
thirdly , this is public expenditure through the european budget .
it is simply a question of carrying out this planning .
many fellow member have already gone into the detail .
i would like to limit myself to these general statement .
this year we are reviewing the list of ten-t priority project .
it also ha to modernise the road infrastructure , port and airport .
poverty mean one thing in the united kingdom and another in bulgaria .
without internal cohesion there can be no external competitiveness .
in time everyone would thus become competitive on their own strength .
interdependence among economy show the need for cohesion and ensuring [ ... ]
the objective of le poverty is based on today .
( de ) thank you very much mr president .
he will now miss one of the most important measure .
this requires a comprehensive initiative for these potential green job .
today , 30 % of european do not have vocational qualification .
we are talking about sustainability in the environmental sense .
we know that forced growth and globalisation have dreadful consequence for the environment .
we are talking about sustainability in the social sense .
this is completely contrary to sustainability in the social sense .
this wa the direct question asked by mr bokros .
the treaty of maastricht talked about economic and monetary union .
it is also something that the treaty of lisbon requires u to do .
this phase is that of globalisation , which is economic union .
not just the internal market or monetary union , but also economic union .
he did express his condolence on behalf of the commission .
disagreement in democracy is normal , but recourse to violence is never acceptable .
it wa the responsible and right thing to do .
i am confident that we will succeed and overcome the formidable challenge .
it is high time to fill the 'e ' with life .
the main building block of our proposal are threefold .
the third building block will be a crisis-resolution mechanism .
the financial mechanism for greece serf the immediate need for the current purpose .
i count on the european parliament to support reinforcing economic governance in europe .
that is what our citizen are expecting from u .
the vote will take place during the second part-session in may .
( the sitting wa suspended for five minute due to technical issue )
innovation is only possible a a result of partnership , of joint support .
however , fine statement are not sufficient to resolve current problem .
a top-down and bottom-up approach have to meet each other .
realistic benchmark have to be set to increase employment , especially youth employability .
better coherence need to be created between the labour market and education .
the concept of life-long and life-wide learning are to be tackled seriously .
a longer lifespan doe not in itself mean a longer productive career .
it go without saying that creating a suitable infrastructure must be a priority .
it would result in the failure of the cohesion principle at european level .
having a quantitative target for reducing poverty is problematic .
the best steward of the european countryside are the agricultural producer themselves .
the eu 2020 strategy can not succeed without the cohesion policy , either .
the commission must take the driving seat and lead this process .
the europe 2020 strategy should be a strategy for catching up and convergence .
it wa the result of violent act that we absolutely and categorically condemn .
the culmination of this is in the treaty of lisbon .
then , fourthly , the accession of the eu to the convention .
by mid-march the commission had proposed a negotiation mandate to the council .
the accession should therefore preserve the substantive and procedural feature of that system .
this is what we are going to adopt now .
now there is a legal basis for the accession becoming a reality .
just today i spoke to some moroccan member of parliament .
the convention reinforces the charter and the charter supplement the convention .
one of these substantial issue is the relationship between the court .
it is also a precondition that internal legal remedy be fully exhausted first .
mr beňová and mr wikström have spoken about this .
it is my conviction that the european union lack commitment in this area .
so finally , thanks to you , we have it .
i would like to give a very relevant example .
protocol have since been added to it over time .
i will not repeat it because i would say exactly the same .
i could cite quite a few recent example of that .
are we trying to stipulate their reception via a circuitous route ?
i believe that the answer to this is a follows .
finally , accession provides the eu with additional credibility in it foreign relation .
just the convention or it additional protocol a well ?
what form of representation will the eu use in the convention 's body ?
what role will parliament play in appointing the eu judge to the echr ?
i firmly believe that all these question will be answered soon .
the number of case increase significantly from year to year .
the next item is the council and commission statement on electric car .
i shall end with a question to mr tajani .
the commission tends to refer to cleanly propelled vehicle generically .
the united state and china are working jointly on conductive charge coupler .
are the french quicker , or the german or the spaniard ?
secondly , we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all area .
we need to be able to take these into account in future .
fourthly , we must provide tax relief on electric car throughout europe .
avoiding , switching and improving are therefore the order of the day .
we need to find the most environmentally friendly propulsion technology for vehicle .
electric vehicle include train , tram , bus , car and bicycle .
at most , electric car solve the emission problem .
therefore , the number of car must be reduced .
the green will vote in favour of this resolution .
there will certainly be more room for discussion there .
however , standard are only one of the instrument for helping industry .
pressure for innovation should come not from regulation but from demand .
by the way , the electric bicycle i ride wa made in china .
we now want a standardised electric car in the european union .
besides , an electric car is useless at the moment .
i will single out three priority from your action plan .
otherwise , we will get bogged down in a fragmented market .
might i suggest that you do your best to speed that up ?
i am also grateful to commissioner tajani for the point he made .
another essential factor will be the modernisation of electricity grid .
now , the electric car is a fine flagship .
europe ha a tradition and a reputation when it come to quality .
these mayor came up with the idea of smart city .
my country , the netherlands , ha made a choice .
we have said 'yes ' to a german plug .
first of all , we lack a proper communication strategy .
however , they still account for only 1.3 % of all vehicle registered .
put briefly , in urban condition these vehicle are too quiet .
we still have a large number of item on the agenda .
obviously i will be even-handed in my treatment of the different political group .
in this respect , standardisation of electric vehicle becomes vital .
( e ) mr president , europe 2020 and the electric car .
a far a technology go , electric vehicle technology already exists .
i think that it is very important to take his view into account .
electric vehicle compensate for this irregularity through their own special feature .
furthermore , they also contribute a far a energy security is concerned .
many member state , in fact , are choosing them .
we are more competitive if we focus on innovation and research .
romania would like to introduce electric car gradually on it domestic market .
in this respect , the commission must provide financial support to member state .
the next item is one-minute speech under rule 150 .
this is exactly what is in the process of happening in romania too .
we escaped thanks to the bundesbank 's refusal to prop up sterling .
whilst it remains in the eurozone , greece ha no way out .
free the greek from the shackle of the euro .
human life is more important than any economic gain .
test flight have been undertaken , but the evaluation is taking time .
eighty per cent of the region 's population are pole .
they are a blatant application of capitalist development which lead to crisis .
the solution is to nationalise the monopoly and give power to the people .
we believe that the greek people will win their fight .
jobbik belief that it is possible to rid political life of corruption .
on 8 may , europe celebrates victory over nazism .
however , lady and gentleman , i have some unpleasant news .
the leader of european state pretend that nothing is going on .
today , however , they are commemorated a hero in latvia .
mr president , history ha shown u that crisis can generate progress .
we can not put off this decision any longer .
the area of cohesion alone leaf a great deal to be desired .
more effort need to be made particularly in this area in the future .
the area of agriculture and natural resource need to be highlighted in particular .
direct control of the payment and how the fund are used is essential .
only then can the aid actually have the desired effect .
i am taking the floor so that i can expose an injustice .
are there player with a simple or collective dominant position ?
the latest took place on 12 april this year at the econ committee .
what are the main conclusion of this long consultation process ?
we have to be proportionate when we interfere in how market work .
this will result in better-quality repair service and lower price .
there is an undeniable phenomenon of predominance of large car manufacturer .
we must take action to counter the abuse of guarantee by producer .
commissioner , competition is not an end in itself .
this includes , firstly , genuine authorisation for multi-branding .
thirdly , it includes providing the necessary opportunity for gaining qualification .
they also need to be in a position to maintain electric car .
they need to be able to make safe investment over a long period .
regulation ( ec ) no 1400/2002 reduced this discrepancy .
local garage owner can not pose a threat to free competition in europe .
this domination doe not exist in the case of competing manufacturer .
it doe not exist in respect of other producer .
they are wrong ; they are aimed at the wrong people .
we have the problem of different national regulation if only single branding remains .
please stand up for small and medium-sized enterprise , too .
multi-branding is part of competition and help to protect consumer .
most of these are family-owned enterprise in local town and local village .
the current proposal by the commission improves all of that .
small and medium-sized enterprise : what ha happened there ?
i mean everybody 's opinion , including yours , of course .
what ha happened to small dealer in recent year ?
commission communication on action against cancer : european partnership ( debate )
it is important to note that action is already underway .
difference exist in the acquisition of cancer data , too .
the exchange of good practice would be unimaginable without encouragement from community institution .
the third key word in the report is partnership .
a close relationship between doctor and patient is not enough .
this underline the potential of the european partnership for action against cancer .
the commission stand ready to provide all the necessary support .
i believe this could definitely strengthen the expertise and recommendation .
the older the population , the more case of cancer can be expected .
the interest of citizen and the health of citizen is paramount !
stress , lifestyle , chemical and virus can also cause cancer .
thus , cancer doe not stop at national border .
where doe the commission stand with regard to research ?
can we realistically double the effectiveness of our screening throughout europe ?
some type of cancer affect woman and men differently .
the european commission must allocate fund for research in this area .
we must , of course , address the plague of cancer .
cancer is a global problem that continues to persist , despite medical advance .
in the eu , around 3.2 million people develop cancer each year .
the main type of cancer are lung , bowel and breast cancer .
the most cost-effective strategy with the best prospect of success is screening .
i wish them all the best , and my thought are with them .
we must also keep stressing the importance of research .
thank you and i wish you all a good night .
this is absolutely necessary for an effective preventive action .
information campaign should also be focused on educational institution .
parsimony today may lead to all kind of expense tomorrow .
how can icts make this major contribution to transforming our economy ?
let me mention a few that address concern raised in your report .
in february 2010 the ict for energy efficiency forum wa launched .
the forum brings together leading eu , japanese and u high-tech industry association .
major european city have signed up to the green digital charter .
work with the commission 's smart grid task force is also advancing .
a set of recommendation is expected by the end of 2011 .
the fall concern all spending area except direct expenditure and pre-accession fund .
area of major concern still exist in relation to the structural fund too .
secondly , reducing the number of irregularity and significantly improving the regulation .
a part of this , the fight against fraud department wa set up .
i agree totally with every effort made to fight fraud .
considerable progress ha been achieved concerning transparency about the beneficiary of eu fund .
olaf and ia have been cooperating closely since 2003 .
olaf is willing to cooperate still more closely with the ia .
the credibility of the structural fund among european is at stake .
today this is one of the key issue for successful crisis management .
however , this wa not the case with regard to pre-accession aid .
here the negative effect have increased by 90.6 % .
the money is continuing to flow nevertheless and in ever higher amount .
kyrgyzstan ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
european investment bank ( eib ) - annual report 2008 ( debate )
this is the title of our current agenda item .
the treaty of lisbon came into force six month ago .
finally , i would like to draw your attention to two issue .
this is the continuation of a tradition begun a few year ago .
we will have the opportunity to discus this with parliament .
parliament had called for a better mutual understanding between the two bank .
what can be expected from an investment bank during a crisis ?
it is the member state that are the partner of the eib .
commissioner , i would like you to support this idea .
i am told that the member state are against it .
it increased the money supply and ensured that the lending volume increased significantly .
these investment were able to alleviate the crisis significantly .
small enterprise are , of course , the engine of our economy .
it is beneficial to the eu to have stable and economically strong neighbour .
openness , transparency and the combating of fraud are particularly important subject area .
so , finally i come to a blot on the eib 's protocol .
it is very disappointing that equality within the eib is still so poor .
we need public lending instrument , and even more so at european level .
what role should you play in our opinion , though ?
from that point of view , allow me to quote just one figure .
i think that this is how you will play your role a catalyst .
support for this sector is especially valuable , particularly in time of crisis .
and what have such loan done for the european economy ?
so we are not out of the wood yet .
i would like to know : is this the case ?
i am sure that this will receive broad support in the european parliament .
i am referring here , for example , to the investment facility .
will this position be pursued for other request to finance nuclear power station ?
a we look on , ukraine is going through a crisis .
i would like to put that in a political context .
mr maystadt , i am convinced that we must continue along these line .
we urgently need a european mechanism for financial stability .
i do not want anything to do with a person of this kind .
my country , lithuania , is a case in point .
mr győri and mr schmidt , in particular , underlined this .
the third operational priority is energy and the fight against climate change .
i think we are already the most supervised international financial institution .
finally , a specific point raised by mr schmidt .
the figure that he quoted concern only managerial staff .
i wish to say three thing on the matter .
many of you have , understandably , referred to the situation in greece .
ukraine wa mentioned , a well a the balkan region .
it wa a joint effort , and the success is also shared .
mr hans-peter martin ha asked for the floor due to personal allusion .
i have to tell you that what mr mölzer ha said is untrue .
on the way in here he did indeed call me a psychopath .
that is the way in which radical right-winger work .
we should also be dealing with the dangerous rise of right-wing radicalism .
this must be stopped before it get out of hand .
the greatest difficulty these business currently face is in accessing funding and capital .
the financial intermediary must pas these loan on to the small business .
in 2008 , the european investment bank celebrated it 50th anniversary .
the positive role played by the eib during the crisis is incontrovertible .
mass atrocity in jos , nigeria , in january and march ( debate )
according to the constitution , acting president jonathan automatically becomes the substantive president .
thousand have been left homeless and are currently in camp .
religious difference often fuel and amplify existing difference , leading to larger clash .
under the edf we support development cooperation in nigeria .
indigenous farmer feel threatened by settler looking for pasture for their livestock .
we therefore call for a wider examination of the cause of this conflict .
what can the european union do in such circumstance ?
some have been waiting to be tried for 10 year .
they will be repeated in the future unless something is done .
secondly , it must bring the perpetrator to justice .
dreadful occurrence of this kind can not be tolerated .
thirdly , it must encourage dialogue between the ethnic and religious group .
nigeria is one of the most corrupt country in the world .
in bank account in switzerland , the united kingdom and france .
there is talk of over 500 death in the past three month .
it is a large , wealthy country with huge social inequality .
with this in mind , i think that an international presence is needed .
the international community need to be specifically involved once again .
forty year on , sadly , little seems to have changed .
i think it is important to refer to their own document .
i would like to raise two point in my speech .
many of you have highlighted the complexity of societal problem in nigeria .
we actively give strong and constructive support to nigeria .
however , this condemnation should not be limited just to word .
it should include action which will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the future .
the complicated background to the conflict show the depth of the division involved .
nigerian christian and nigerian muslim differ not only with respect to religion .

- let u proceed to the explanation of vote .
we are guaranteeing good quality part at reasonable price .
if they do not , we are a disgrace .
( de ) mr president , animal welfare is indivisible .
it must be standardised and we need a global definition of it .
we need to take account of different soil condition across the european union .
- mr president , thank you for the endorsement .
the word 'cyanide ' is synonymous with 'death ' .
one of the largest natural field in the world is located in transylvania .
europe ha had enough of one chernobyl and doe not need another one .
europe must demonstrate that it is united in this area a well .
mr president , that is why i voted in favour of the report .
the result that we saw in copenhagen are definitely not enough .
we need to pay special attention to the way we produce our energy .
promoting low-carbon energy source is a well-known argument used by the nuclear lobby .
a an austrian , i do not regard nuclear power a renewable energy .
he lead opinion ; he doe not follow opinion .
vice president biden 's visit to the european union today demonstrates this commitment .
mr vice president , the timing of your address could not be better .
let me state it a plainly a i can .
we believe it is absolutely essential to american prosperity and long-term security .
a community dedicated to free thought , free movement and free enterprise .
climate change : one of the greatest threat our planet face .
the scourge ha no respect for border - none .
i suspect that is how every world leader look at their role .
but i do not blame you for questioning it .
courage is also what it take to sit down and listen .
it is no accident that we have already returned several time since then .
we need each other more now than we ever have .
- mr vice president , thank you very much .
it wa a great basis for future cooperation and our future talk .
a you said , listen and talk to each other .
it is a good beginning to our partnership and cooperation .
mr vice president , once again , thank you very much .
significantly , one observer ha spoken of systematic religious persecution .
that is my criticism , and that is why i abstained .
northern ireland also us the system of proportional representation for european election .
there will be 18 new member from 12 member state .
it is for that reason that i have voted against this report .
however , we have decided that the most important principle is representativeness .
consequently , they adapted the way in which the election were held .
nonetheless , there is a broad consensus that it should be done now .
i believe that member only acquire legitimacy through election .
the treaty of lisbon increase the number of meps from 736 to 751 .
the exceptional circumstance fully justify the exceptional solution adopted .
this is scheming between friend , with the support of this parliament .
furthermore , after his initial democratic undertaking bakiyev 's rule turned authoritarian .
meanwhile , bakiyev fled the country to seek refuge in kazakhstan .
there can be no consent , on our part , to other measure .
i welcome the recent communication on clean and efficient vehicle .
another essential factor will be the modernisation of electricity grid .
we must find way of encouraging european consumer towards using electric car .
i think that local authority have an important role to play in this .
support for the development of electric vehicle may have numerous benefit .
approximately 85 % of the eu 's gdp is generated in city .
in europe 380 000 business are involved in motor vehicle distribution and service .
it follows detailed consultation with the motor vehicle sector .
admittedly , whether doing or undoing , one is still taking action .
for this reason , i have voted against the commission proposal .
i would reiterate the importance of supporting such proposal .
one european in three will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime .
research and prevention are the main line of attack against this disease .
it is also essential to reduce inequality in treatment .
cancer is one of the biggest health challenge we are facing worldwide .
the member state must act together , particularly in the area of screening .
in europe , one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime .
this is fundamental to improving patient ' everyday life .
public health is one of the eu 's priority .
out of 3 million new sufferer , 1.7 million will not survive .
early diagnosis and treatment could reduce this figure significantly .
all measure intended to fight cancer and minimise it effect should be supported .
to achieve this , suitable national testing programme are needed .
the restriction placed on the financial resource for these objective are disturbing .
cancer is a social and political problem , not just a health problem .
icts can , in actual fact , significantly reduce co2 emission .
the importance of access to high-speed internet for everyone is paramount .
ict solution must be included when planning the new european transport policy .
time and financial resource are needed to change this .
however , mitigation and adaptation measure must not be separate .
civil protection structure have to prioritise preparedness for flood and drought .
the issue of adaptation is cross-cutting and affect several sectoral policy .
there must be greater political coordination by member state in these area .
a the poet said : hey lumberjack , stop a moment .
over the year we have seen irregularity decrease significantly .
in writing . - in the final vote , i said in favour .
the greatest improvement occurred in the area of spending on agriculture .
the report show that the estimated amount of irregularity fell by 34 % .
however , it is essential to guarantee it full operational independence .
combating fraud in european project should be a priority for u .
in particular , loan to smes have increased by 42 % .
in writing . - that wa an easy one .
these disturbance are now taking place even more frequently .
what wa lacking wa an outcry from the eu .

text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
we will now proceed to the order of business .
we will now proceed to the final establishment of the order of business .
there is , however , one proposal about wednesday .
mr gräßle will move the request on behalf of the ppe group .
however , the resolution itself will be dealt with during the june part-session .
we are able to support this motion for the reason stated .
an official letter is on it way to parliament .
to this extent , i agree with mr gräßle .
voting on the czarnecki report will take place on wednesday .
the deadline for tabling amendment is tuesday , 18 may at 12.00 .
the request will be moved by the rapporteur , mr bauer .
therefore , i ask that we postpone this until the june plenary .
it is therefore absolutely right to put this on the agenda .
the debate on the bauer report will be postponed until the next part-session .
the request will be explained further by mr preda .
who would like to speak in favour of the request ?
these are urgent matter , which are discussed on thursday afternoon .
the order of business for our plenary sitting ha been established .
flawed european economic governance reacted , in my opinion , too late .
that is what i wanted to talk to you about .
in the island i hail from , it is the main industry .
there is talk of loss of eur 42 million a day .
( sl ) today , we are marking the international day against homophobia .
today , most european say that the burkha should be banned .
we can not permit religious argument to fuel discrimination and violence .
the competitiveness council will be informed of the result on that date .
the recent onerous legislation on hedge fund is the clear signal of this .
what ha been the response of parliament to all of this ?
so far , domestic effort have not been effective in all member state .
we should not ignore this reality ; we should recognise it .
any delay will hurt the interest of european citizen .
the process of the agreement 's ratification ha effectively entered it closing stage .
to save the eurozone , we have to reform it governance .
these proposal should also take into account a common programme of structural reform .
what can we do to check the bank ' urge to provide credit ?
how can we arrive at a distinction between value and monetary value ?
let u hope he keep to his word and doe that .
we must not overlook the matter of teaching tolerance ; quite the contrary .
i made a commitment to inform europe 's institution about this civil protest .
mr kazak , you spoke too quickly for our interpreter .
it wa not possible for them to interpret your speech precisely .
parliament adopted it amendment at first reading on 4 may 2009 .
you therefore have one minute left for the end .
it also take a big step forward in term of promoting female entrepreneurship .
it involves creating a space for private initiative and new job .
the choice of instrument must remain in the hand of the member state .
nonetheless , i should like to make the same point a mr lulling .
i think that that is a good thing , that it is important .
interesting time , and an interesting side-effect to our report .
should the state not , in these circumstance , support their effort ?
madam president , i would like to thank the council and the commission .
naturally , it is not everything we could have wished .
more regulation and more insurance obligation were a matter of debate .
this must also come from the enterprise themselves , however .
i would like to thank everyone who contributed to it .
it is a positive step , which we support .
baker ' spouse will now be able to benefit from social right .
the duration of this leave is currently set at 14 week .
europe 's campaign to protect woman is making headway with this text .
( pt ) madam president , this directive need to be reviewed urgently .
there is , however , a prerequisite to contribute to social security .
i am talking about woman who work in the home .
these entitlement are to be provided for by legislation at eu level .
i encourage all fellow member to endorse this report .
it is another step on what is still a very long road .
the present compromise address some of the existing inequality .
around 30 % of all those in self-employment in the eu are woman .
( fr ) lady and gentleman , i am satisfied .
i should like to reassure mr romeva i rueda .
read it ; i do not have the time to read it out .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 18 may 2010 .
they work when they are sick , because it is financially more advantageous .
assisting spouse do not have their own social security arrangement .
the state doe not have to contribute to their maintenance .
it 's a matter of justice and common sense - in two way .
secondly , we can not discriminate against the new-born child in these family .
energy performance of building ( recast ) ( debate )
these provision are also supplemented by a declaration from the commission .
this deadline ha been brought forward by two year for the public sector .
provision were introduced on issuing and displaying energy performance certificate .
the directive will be reviewed by 1 january 2017 .
energy efficiency is the cheapest way to combat climate change .
i am sure that parliament 's support today represents an important step .
i would like to thank you all for your good cooperation .
i believe it to be a great step in the right direction .
forty per cent of energy is used for heating and cooling building .
however , we are also concerned with creating new job .
we should take this opportunity to start investing again .
firstly , assistance for national government with transposing the directive .
secondly , a you have mentioned , financing model .
this recast wa born because the original directive wa being poorly implemented .
i would like to finish on this , mr president .
however , i think that will be difficult in some area .
however , reclassification requires increased public and private investment .
first , the directive offer many new business opportunity to entrepreneur .
2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion .
europe 's citizen can not bear the cost alone for modernising energy system .
what can be done easily ha , in part , already been done .
combined heat and power facility also involve expensive dual structure .
a such , we should focus on these building and house immediately .
a such , there is no need to build new house .
the construction sector offer great potential for energy saving .
this directive will also help u to overcome the crisis .
it realisation requires expert and specialist , thereby creating job .
this mean that the number of partner to be won over is manageable .
in the area of building , there are a huge number of player .
we are working intensively on the preparation for this .
we have long been making preparation for the next financial period .
i would suggest somewhere between 8 and 12 % .
commissioner , we will give you our support in creating this fund .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 18 may 2010 .
after all , building are responsible for approximately 40 % of co2 emission .
we must be mindful of the cost incurred by introducing new norm .
however , two feature of the directive under discussion deserve a positive response .
textile name and related labelling of textile product ( debate )
consumer can consult a website or other source for additional information if required .
the proposal therefore aim to promote innovation within the textile sector .
i would also like to make some observation about other amendment .
consumer must be able to make an informed choice when buying textile product .
my sincere thanks to all of you for your cooperation .
this textile regulation is a sound proposal and a necessary one .
we therefore also wanted it to contain a 100 % fibre composition list .
however , we did not want to stop there .
we clearly need our own european standard on this subject .
i should also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur .
allow me to reemphasise what the issue is here .
we would all like to see clear country-of-origin marking .
make some political statement , but let u not hold this up unnecessarily .
a consumer , we have the right to know that .
this would benefit not only consumer , but also serious company .
it follows that the uk independence party regard this report with suspicion .
later , there is even a hint of a repeal .
we have a completely effective system for sizing in the uk .
this always result in mention of the power of consumer .
why have we not been much more ambitious a regard social labelling ?
many citizen want to know where the fibre and textile come from .
their background includes the way in which they were manufactured .
we should then go further by establishing real community preference .
this proposal is equally important for both the industry and the consumer .
this will allow social decision on purchasing choice to be made .
i say that to illustrate how important thread and fabric are .
the 'made in ' label is not a technical issue .
it is , i think , above all , a highly political issue .
i think that our contribution will play a major role here .
i am speaking specifically about 'made in ' origin marking .
can we succeed in arriving at a rule for consumer ?
it is very complex to get our labelling correct .
what is the sense of this dual track system ?
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 18 may 2010 ) .
alternatively , the chip might set off security alert at airport .
allow me to reiterate and highlight the main point of my report .
unfortunately , this is at the expense of innovation and quality .
the commission ha some urgent reworking to do here .
better coordination within the commission is also urgently needed .
this , too , wa something i sought to reiterate in my report .
that is also something that i wanted clearly reiterated in my report .
i notice that several speaker would like to express their opinion .
it wa a pleasure to work with her on this report .
this is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable .
we can not simply say that it is something we do not want .
the court of justice ha already ruled on all this .
that is our demand and consequently , we have submitted an alternative resolution .
we ask our fellow member to support this alternative resolution .
i would also like to comment on the problem of the lowest price .
in my opinion , we should support the basic principle of that aim .
we consider it essential to simplify standard and achieve greater legal certainty .
this evaluation is a prerequisite for any legislative initiative on the matter .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 18 may 2010 ) .
policy coherence for development is laid down in the treaty of lisbon .
it is now a matter of how this plan is implemented .
so far , the commission ha not been able to eliminate this suspicion .
i would urge colleague to note those paragraph carefully .
i am talking about development policy , not just official development assistance .
it doe not limit the scope of our effort .
it link the evaluation of policy to real strategic objective .
this proposal is currently being examined by the member state .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 18 may 2010 ) .
that is not in question and the union is fully aware of it .
in writing . - i support this resolution on policy coherence for development .
the rule on tachograph also need to be improved .
it ha to be said that the result were sobering .
in time of crisis , undertaking come under increasing pressure .
the penalty must be clear , transparent and , above all , comparable .
naturally , they are not always familiar with our system .
an agency with general competence for road transport could be responsible for this .
one thing is clear , however : such an office must exist .
there is one further significant factor to mention before i conclude my comment .
in many member state , there are not really sufficient safe parking area .
this report must not be the end of this work .
the commission welcome parliament 's decision to follow up the report it drafted .
clearly , this is potentially detrimental to road safety and to competition .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 18 may 2010 ) .
one , of course , is the 20 % threshold .
it is probably more balanced than wa originally intended .
that is an area in which we need to improve .
that is not what it is about at all .
in the final event , it is only about cost increase .
this must be signalled according to the maxim 'we have understood ! '
it requires more efficient spending , more accountability and more responsibility .
we do not need a fleet of car here in strasbourg .
but today i will refer to the ethic of this house .
coincidentally , the council ha failed to approve budget increase for parliament .
madam president , eur 6 400 is a huge amount of money .
that is what should happen , but it doe not .
the elite decides , and the public cough up .
if you are not worth yours , then you have my sympathy .
we should be talking about massive saving , not increase .
there are many way in which this could be done .
for a start , we should be cutting unnecessary waste and expenditure .
we seem to think that we live in a different world .
i would like to thank everyone who expressed an opinion .
all of that therefore still ha to be done .
however , this end the joint debate on the budget .
the si ii should have become operational in 2007 .
first , when is this migration to take place ?
we propose that it be set for 31 december 2013 .
i would like to thank everyone for being extremely cooperative .
a soon a he join u , i will give him the floor .
we are working very closely and very well together on this .
we all have a common interest in si ii working .
the vote tomorrow is very timely for the si ii project .
it will be available for the council on 3 and 4 june .
the rapporteur call for a specific deadline for si ii development .
i am sorry that mr tavares is not yet here .
for these group of refugee , resettlement can be the only solution .
the proposal tabled in september 2009 aim to improve the situation .
the european response to global resettlement requirement ha been adequate to date .
madam president , i would like to thank mr malmström for being here .
a commission from parliament ha visited the iraqi palestinian .
it is very important to make clear which people this relates to .
madam president , i would like to speak about the schengen information system .
we must have a minimum commitment on file connection risk .
we saw fit to maintain these priority but give them autonomy .
madam president , i shall also speak on the schengen information system .
in our opinion , the approach taken by the rapporteur is absolutely right .
we can not continue investing money into a lifelong project .
( e ) madam president , i will explain my position succinctly .
the main problem is a lack of solidarity within the union .
( sk ) i would like to talk about the schengen information system .
mr ehrenhauser , i think you are speaking on the wrong subject .
this is the joint debate on the schengen agreement .
secondly , there can be no turning back from si ii today .
si ii will enable rapid verification of data in future .
in relation to this , work on si ii must be continued .
the commission ha already made proposal in this regard .
we have the malta pilot project and are evaluating this .
many thanks for the positive comment by various fellow member .
i think that give u the right degree of urgency for this debate .
however , there is another debate which need to be held .
if nothing else , the rapporteur 's report recognises the problem .
we have changed the name on the screen , a you have seen .
that , too , is a subject for the framework agreement .
i am sure that mr malmström will be a wonderful representative .
we all know what a key role agriculture play in the local economy .
these region have permanent handicap and we need to recognise this .
what will be left when these five year are up ?
the restriction and constraint that affect the outermost region are permanent .
i am going to talk about the canary island .
unfortunately , there wa no consensus on this position at the last trialogue .
without our support , this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence .
my heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved .
for them , it will guarantee the sustainability of the industry .
still on milk , i agree with our fellow member , mr tirolien .
this ha resulted in price volatility and great financial loss for farmer .
last week , i attended the royal agricultural show in northern ireland .
mr president , i welcome proposal to help the outermost region .
moreover , i am sure that we will be able to do so .
that doe not mean that the cap should not be adapted .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.35 and resumed at 12.05 )
it wa due for debate last night under catch-the-eye .
an eu strategy for youth - investing and empowering (
specific measure for agriculture in the outermost region of the union (
we reject all the amendment , except our own .
it seems to me this will make more sense .
penalty for serious infringement against the social rule in road transport (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
yesterday , my colleague , marian-jean marinescu , mentioned a special fund .
the provision of additional resource in a time of crisis is questionable .
i would like to say that the voting equipment showed that i abstained .
on the other hand , we must fight more effectively against illegal migration .
now to the schengen item , if i may .
nevertheless , this report provides clear outline which country should follow .
even domestic parliament can do this , thanks to the treaty of lisbon .
it committed budgetary fund for aid to banana producer in those region .
element that are not meaningful and appropriate must be dismantled and simplified .
our stated goal is to make agricultural policy simpler and more transparent .
this legislation need urgent attention , and more common sense is needed .
we therefore need clear , workable and comprehensible model .
so this is a step in the right direction .
i hope that the other member state will also make it their concern .
energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production .
green investment for our child , not radioactive waste !
the commission responded with export refund a an emergency measure .
mr mcguinness , you were exactly right on the rule .
this solution lie in the harmonisation and interpretation of the legislation .
this can be found in paragraph 17 , a amended .
there are still far too many accident on europe 's road .
this will remain a pious hope until common asylum procedure are adopted .
it is vital for u to harmonise both our asylum law and practice .
this office will be responsible for providing specialised assistance .
we meps reserve the fundamental right to appoint it executive director .
a a result , the support would also be helpful for resettlement .
however , reclassification requires increased public and private investment .
we spend 50 % of our life in our home .
existing building will have to be improved if possible .
we must give priority to the way in which our home are designed .
moreover , this strategy will create job and contribute to sustainable growth .
the basic factor affecting energy performance are : 1 .
the longer the chain of conversion , the greater the loss .
a large part of this pass into the environment .
friction loss are around 30 % of total energy .
the issue of energy efficiency is crucial to the 2020 strategy .
energy saving for energy efficient building average 30 % over conventional building .
in lithuania alone , there are over 35 000 apartment block .
the conservative government in lithuania is incapable of beginning building insulation .
research in the construction sector is moving towards a greener approach to building .
this also involves applying these requirement to existing building .
member state must adopt suitable measure in order to implement this directive quickly .
the eu budget will fund part of the cost of the reform .
the construction sector is one with tremendous energy saving potential .
all public sector building must achieve this two year earlier .
nearly zero energy building are building with very high energy performance .
this directive represents an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
this is one of the eligible criterion under the erf .
only 10 eu member state , including portugal , accept refugee for resettlement .
it is for that reason that i voted against this report .
i therefore support the setting up of a fund at european level .
in reality , the exact opposite is the case .
government fail in the reception and care of refugee .
the christian organisation are a thorn in the eye of our conscience .
it is indeed regrettable that the start of this system ha been delayed .
i voted broadly in favour of the proposed amendment to this regulation .
i express my full support for the report by mr coelho .
this report also indicates our disagreement with the council 's vision .
for this reason , access to educational and professional guidance service is essential .
despite the previously mentioned reservation , i back the entire report .
only 10 eu member state , including portugal , accept refugee for resettlement .
the creation of this programme constitutes an important step in that direction .
allow me to express my support for the report by mr tavares .
we can not have discrepancy over this definition at european level .
the pilot programme in malta is a very good example in this direction .
it is good that a joint eu resettlement programme ha been established .
for this reason , we voted against this report .
moreover , the learning of foreign language is crucially important .
a an english teacher , i am particularly aware of this .
from this point of view , therefore , education is very important .
that is a long-term struggle , but it is something worth fighting for .
i express my support for the report by mr lehne .
in order to achieve this , we must introduce uniform and global guideline .
these are concern that must be present in any european strategy for youth .
we also advocated the promotion of opportunity for lifelong learning .
what doe the future hold in store for them ?
there is no point hiding behind good intention and promise .
and it is our duty to give them proper answer .
we must invest ; we must provide certainty , offer opportunity .
furthermore , no policy can truly function without cross-sectoral implementation .
i therefore advocate an ever greater commitment to youth policy at eu level .
there are definitely more problem than those i have mentioned .
i agree with the view expressed by mr papanikolaou .
the creation of a new eu strategy for youth is of crucial importance .
the ageing population will also have a strong impact on their future .
in the future , these programme should receive greater financial support .
i also appeal for improvement and full implementation of the erasmus mundus programme .
the global economic crisis came a a painful blow to u all .
now we have the chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity .
we owe it to the future generation of european .
education and employment are the principal area from an investment point of view .
we need to facilitate a smoother transition between education and the labour market .
voter turnout among young people is very low in eastern europe .
therefore , we must revive their interest in the political process .
it wa important to strengthen the protection of self-employed woman .
a i share this vision , i voted for this report .
for the above reason , i voted for this proposal .
that must be for all of the member state to decide for themselves .
i do not think that there are any ground for this restriction .
i wish to express my support for mr lulling 's report .
however , we do oppose this legislation being made at eu level .
for these reason , the ecr group ha abstained on amendment 1-17 .
in writing . - i have supported this document .
macro-financial assistance to ukraine is particularly significant at this time .
i agree with this decision to provide ukraine with exceptional mfa .
this economic transition must be supported by effort aimed at institutional reform .
i am voting against the macro-financial assistance presented today to the european parliament .
the financial imbalance relate to budget and the balance of payment .
the eu must therefore be an area of solidarity .
i voted in favour of the report by mr moreira .
the macro-financial assistance programme set out to complement other financing from the union .
it will be submitted to the european parliament only this week .
the change are related to the sugar , milk and wine sector .
i congratulate the rapporteur involved on the quality of their work .
of course , all measure must be based on a community framework .
i believe that the proposed change are positive for the outermost area concerned .
it would therefore be advisable to encourage the diversification of economic activity .
in march , parliament adopted the guideline for 2011 .
this cost-benefit analysis is important to ensure better result and resource management .
in addition , it is essential to rebuild trust between authority and farmer .
direct payment are therefore vital and must be maintained .
simplification ha to mean greater responsibility for all the actor involved .
that is exactly what we want for the new cap .
the harmonisation of legislation must be accompanied by the elimination of redundancy .
the report also continues to support the current model for distributing aid .
the cap should not be reduced just to the distribution of money .
however , i do agree with the essence of the report .
it ha to be results-orientated and offer a greater capacity to respond .
the simplification measure are therefore recognised a necessary and urgent by everyone .
administering the common agricultural policy is often excessively complicated .
the cost of monitoring financing will also be lower .
legal clarification is essential , for everyone 's benefit .
that is why i abstained from the final vote on this report .
it purpose is to purchase good and service at the best price/quality ratio .
unfortunately , an ever increasing number of member state have encountered such problem .
simplified , uniform legislation is required for all member state .
we need coordinated action at european level to counter this effect .
it is essential for european policy on development to be coherent .
the european union is the biggest aid donor in the world .
we aim to change the status quo , and rightly so .
the european union ha a duty to combat this situation .
that requires more efficient and effective development cooperation and assistance policy .
official development assistance ( oda ) commitment are still not being fulfilled satisfactorily .
trade policy can not be immune to this goal .
i deplore the negative vote of the epp and ecr group .
the debate on eu policy coherence for development is important and valuable .
the european union must set an example in this area .
we would reaffirm that these objective are not necessarily achieved through generic harmonisation .
this will ensure better road safety in each of the member state .
road transport safety ha always been a concern of the eu .
it is therefore that much more important the vehicle be in faultless condition .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the second principle includes traceability , protection of personal data and confidentiality .
the third principle is the framework for quality and safety .
it ha proved it worth in many country where operation run smoothly .
let u enhance what the european union mean today .
allow me to comment on a few specific issue .
i fully share parliament 's concern a regard combating organ trafficking .
the commission is willing to support the member state to address these issue .
what really matter is that the law is implemented .
the line between life and death doe not come any clearer than this .
that is precisely the reason why this debate is quite so emotionally charged .
spain ha organised this much better with it transplant coordinator .
that mean that this , too , is an important point .
this is a subject that we must not simply ignore .
that is why it is our task to put that into practice .
twelve of them die every day because they have waited too long .
the hardest question in the talk related to living donor .
the most shocking have been the report that describe people actually being killed .
we therefore need to screen the organ concerned before they are used .
organ donation rate vary considerably from one country to another .
it is also a question of improving cooperation among all the member state .
it wa clearly just an error of some kind .
this standard is a logical and very welcome step .
some country , on the other hand , require explicit consent .
mr ouzký , many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention .
it wa a problem in the allocation caused by the computer system .
this would not only fly in the face of our aim ...
statistic show that the situation differs greatly among the various member state .
the area of living donation ha been the most challenging .
it is therefore important that we adopt this proposal now .
i really do not believe that we need to harmonise the differing system .
there are some principle and practice to be safeguarded .
that is why a european framework on the issue is required .
all measure must be implemented to combat mafia-style network and transplantation tourism .
this is a difficult and controversial issue which raise important question .
the basque country - euskadi - ha the world record for organ donation .
a i understand it , these two system still coexist in member state .
there seems to be a kind of controversy between the two .
we therefore need to influence public opinion in this area .
let u push for factual knowledge to be exploited in practice .
donation rate and the availability of organ vary considerably between european country .
the lack of organ is a key factor affecting transplant programme .
( de ) madam president , i have followed this debate very closely .
thank you for your input , your cooperation and your support .
that wa our task and that is what we have done .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 may 2010 .
( the sitting wa suspended at 16.25 and resumed at 16.30 )
lady and gentleman , i think that this is headline news .
this increase our credibility , a mr jáuregui 's report very rightly state .
this is also why this review conference is very important .
the common position wa translated into an action plan .
i am going to refer to mr jáuregui atondo 's report .
this is a regrettable loophole that should be removed from the rome statute .
i say that the convention on human right ha done enough damage already .
the convention on human right ha degraded the right of my constituent .
in the name of democracy , let them carry out those promise !
support for this court need to be globalised a well .
the european parliament ha been working constructively and is united on this subject .
britain joined the icc under the previous labour administration .
a for the icc , i would like to express two wish .
that implies ad hoc legal assistance affording access to specialist external lawyer .
france , in particular , ha not yet done this .
this is not entirely theoretical a the case of the danish cartoon illustrates .
denying free speech is what the eu doe best !
should there be no restriction on freedom of speech ?
personally , i continue to believe that it is part of the solution .
the life of hundred of people are at stake .
we hope that fate and god will have mercy on these disaster-stricken region .
africa is a continent where many crime have not yet been punished .
the role of the court in this matter is crucial .
the european union can not continue to give contradictory signal .
it is imperative that president omar al-bashir be handed over to the icc .
i want to underline that i am going to speak a a lawyer .
the european union must not be passive in this situation .
criminal must know they will never go unpunished anywhere .
i do not suppose we can raise any doubt about this , today .
on a formal level , it will also eliminate double standard .
the european court of human right is already overstretched enough .
( e ) madam president , i would like to clarify two thing .
secondly , the jurisdiction of the european court of human right is supranational .
the european union could therefore theoretically infringe the european convention on human right .
there may be other reason , but not the one being given .
that should be clearly stated once and for all .
now there will be supplementary guarantee concerning the eu law .
there were two very specific question which i would like to answer briefly .
some are asking what the point is , and what it add .
to the court of justice of the european union .
i would like to clarify two thing , lady and gentleman .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 may 2010 .
let u hope that this is how it will be .
we must make sure it principle are upheld in all member state .
so we should be glad that the system will be strengthened .
this is initially taking shape in the important stockholm programme .
i hope that the measure will be presented in a user friendly way .
of course we consider the stockholm programme to be very important .
likewise , the provision of information on human right is not sufficiently categorical .
you said people would be put at the centre .
organising same-sex partnership is putting people at the centre .
could you give me an explanation a to why ?
i would like to stress that this is my view .
i would like to mention at least two more area .
on the question of substance , mr reding spoke of added value .
over 100 000 illegal immigrant arrive in greece from turkey every year .
whatever happened to the europe-turkey agreement on the return of these illegal immigrant ?
it is being side-stepped and is barely even mentioned in our programme .
whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by frontex with turkey today ?
that is an understatement if ever there wa one !
the european arrest warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself .
extradition ha been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality .
i would like to suggest having it done before the end of 2010 .
therefore , it would be a measure to stop and prevent it .
this is one of the spanish presidency 's priority .
i refer to the extensive debate that we had earlier .
a you know , work is under way on this directive .
this is a very ambitious and very important directive .
so , there are various important initiative under way in relation to immigration .
i think this is a debate that we need to have .
that is a christmas tree with several hundred wish .
i would like everybody to speak about the reality .
how were these christmas tree wish treated before the lisbon treaty ?
that is where we are starting from : an impossible situation .
and , only then , we have the definite proposal from the commission .
and do you know what will happen with those proposal ?
the arrest warrant : m ludford wa just speaking about this .
colleague , you can not do all this without having mutual trust .
here is an example : you asked for the anti-discrimination directive .
so speak to the council ; speak with those who are blocking it .
the next item is question time ( b7-0211/2010 ) .
subject : communication providing for a higher target for greenhouse gas emission cut
a number of remark need to be made on this proposal .
a a result , the cost of making cut will rise again .
what is the commission 's reaction to the above remark ?
but let me just say one thing very clearly .
i really hope that parliament will also take part in this debate .
it would not be appropriate for me to do so .
a my fellow member ha also said , we still need fund .
there are many way to cope with improved effort there .
i think that is very crucial to all of u .
i would firstly like to thank mr geringer de oedenberg for her question .
moreover , this year , i will take three initiative along these line .
firstly , a proposal for a framework directive on collective copyright management .
i am thinking about a european definition of orphan work .
i want a europe that allows for the emergence of new economic model .
neither am i dogmatic or deluded about the chance of finding one-size-fits-all solution .
i welcome the initiative being taken by the commission .
our preferred approach is to create a regulatory framework favouring pan-european copyright licence .
in particular , i am thinking about the question of the partially sighted .
therefore , the new copyright would not apply to all pre-existing musical composition .
i am asking this a we need legal certainty .
however , we do not intend to amend the catalogue of exception .
the current state aid map wa agreed based on statistic from 2006 .
author . - thank you very much for your reply .
i find it amazing that only three state have actually applied .
that to me is very regressive and need to change .
seventeen member state were given the possibility but only three have done so .
or doe this only take place at the member state level ?
of course , organised crime will be included in this .
the cooperation with candidate and third country is important to tackle crime effectively .
i shall repeat the question in order to obtain a more specific reply .
it is always a tragedy when innocent people are affected by these issue .
we deplore it , and our thought are with their family .
we do not plan any initiative for the moment on this .
for the moment , there is no initiative planned in this regard .
these rule apply to national of all third country subject to visa requirement .
subject : unresolved issue in the turkey-eu joint statement of 5 november 2009
the constant harassment of frontex aircraft by turkish aircraft ;
is there any linkage with the discussion with frontex ?
member of the commission . - i have a busy agenda today !
there wa a joint statement at that time moving forward .
there is a parallel negotiation going on with turkey .
this is , of course , to the benefit of everybody .
is frontex not a very important factor in combating illegal immigration ?
i agree that there is a lot of room for cooperation here .
we still do not have a full calling to account .
have there been any positive change i this respect ?
of course there is still the very sensitive issue of sharing intelligence .
this is based on trust - or lack of trust sometimes .
this is an area where the european union can help .
what can be done at european level to solve this problem ?
will question 33 , in part 3 , be taken ?
i think it extremely unlikely that we will get to question 33 .
if you are waiting for that , i would not do so .
quarterly meeting will be chaired by the european commission .
author . - i want to congratulate the commissioner on progress achieved .
it ha distributed fund to irish bank to distribute on to smes .
we got into the mess we are in because people were on automatic .
to some extent , they are still on automatic .
i urged the president to speed up the delivery time .
the aim is for our small and medium-sized enterprise to be competitive .
many of them have committed themselves to doing this in the future .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.30 and resumed at 21.00 )
should the same principle function in relation to public aid in social housing ?
the second : the question on the principle of subsidiarity and universality .
the third : a question of income limit for access to social housing .
question 2 also refers to a universal right to housing .
this amount concern one member state - the netherlands .
the issue concerned is who is to be allocated housing ?
the threshold that ha now been set is eur 33 000 .
i feel that insufficient room is left for flexibility , for tailor-made solution .
member state must be able to adapt to circumstance .
we are talking about flexibility ; there is not enough elbow room .
moreover , this is another stain on our current model of european integration .
i definitely believe that europe must start from scratch .
commissioner , i believe that we will agree on this point .
the first is simple : what is the legal status of this definition ?
is it to be applied to all member state ?
the universality and the accessibility of public service are at stake .
in the european union , we are facing growing income disparity .
we therefore have the crisis we have at the moment .
( ro ) social housing doe indeed come under service of general interest .
is the commission not intruding in the competence of the member state ?
the issue of subsidiarity is relevant in this debate .
at other time , however , it arrives unobtrusively .
suddenly , we have a european definition on our hand .
they are the one who know these problem best .
those people are mainly taken care of by local authority .
any subsidy given directly to citizen is not subject to state aid rule .
the commission is committed to promoting the quality of social service .
security and prevention measure on offshore oil platform in the eu ( debate )
of course , no set of regulation can offer a 100 % guarantee .
commissioner , often it is not enough to simply increase prevention measure .
however , measure are being taken in the united state .
the obama government wa forced to retreat by the scale of the disaster .
you spoke of minimum standard , commissioner , but that is not enough .
what do you intend to do to move in this direction ?
we want and we need to move away from this oil-based society .
today , more than ever , the industrialised nation are thirsty for oil .
like my fellow member , i too demand several thing .
we have already often experienced failure in radio contact between the different country .
ha that been checked , before an emergency incident occurs ?
would a risk fund perhaps be useful in this connection ?
can you rule out u having the same problem at european level ?
the stipulation should not be 'you can do everything , except ... ' .
( ro ) i , too , welcome the commission 's initiative .
we must ensure that company can not shirk from assuming responsibility .
we can not put up with a similar situation here .
damage to the pipeline will by no mean mean it closure .
there is a lot of destruction of life that should be conserved .
the sooner we do this , the better it will be for everyone .
this type of accident also come under this category .
a a second point , we must move away from oil .
there are more neon lamp than meps here tonight .
depth of 150 and 200 metre can be reached with manned submarine .
all of u in politics and in society must take that path .
incidentally , none of the party involved in the united state dispute that .
consideration to do with prevention therefore take a back seat .
industrial regulation and voluntary undertaking by company do not offer a reassuring solution .
it is absolutely clear that legally defined safety guarantee are needed .
i will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening .
how doe the commission propose to address this gap in the legislation ?
the volcano eruption laid a cloud of volcanic ash over most of europe .
the european union immediately mobilised resource to tackle the most pressing problem .
i am happy to report the first step taken a a consequence .
the final arrangement for setting it up are being made this week .
the package wa adopted in spite of member state ' resistance .
in fact , the translation and publication took longer than the actual negotiation .
unfortunately , there is no intention of this happening .
in 2011. the last member state will join the schengen area .
i want to start by thanking you for your answer .
more clarity will be provided on that subject this week .
a you know , though , there are gap in the legislation .
the railway proved not to be a viable alternative .
in my opinion , that is also very important , commissioner .
we observed that we need every mode of transport , including aviation .
a five-day break , the airline said , could be coped with .
passenger right have been subject to varying comment from different speaker .
perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely .
i will now move on to my final question .
do we have good crisis management arrangement for case like this ?
it also deal with volcanic eruption a a secondary responsibility .
according to my information , they are better prepared for such situation .
what else do you think that we can do ?
i find myself wondering when there really will be plan in place .
quite how , then , is this to be solved ?
do they then pas the money on to the passenger ?
for example , will business people who missed important appointment receive compensation ?
why should it only be the airline that receive compensation ?
commissioner , this question is pending and i await an answer from you .
otherwise , we will be isolated from the eu 's transport system .
i simply wish to remember those who were affected .
this is my diagnosis , commissioner , lady and gentleman .
we are not talking about something in the past .
i know that we can not fight the element .
the crisis will not help u to take measure .
the member state will be reluctant to provide resource .
there are a number of regional airport on the west coast of ireland .
it is not going to go away any time soon .
our european airline and airport have suffered catastrophic financial loss .
i believe that european airline alone have lost more than eur 2 billion .
secondly , the sesar package must be brought forward in a sensible fashion .
i still have some reservation about the creation of a network manager .
for example , what would be the exact role ?
the role of eurocontrol must also be closely examined .
if there is one thing that tourism need , it is certainty .
this is , of course , a significant loss .
i must ask you to continue working to this end .
i must ask you to continue working to this end .
everyone can remove the risk by simply not flying .
and certainly the evidence is there for all to see .
the safety of plane and life must come first .
there is a responsibility , which mainly rest with the pilot .
in europe today , pilot tend to reject this kind of new responsibility .
regarding alternative transport , we will , of course , push ahead .
we do not have report on the damage to air transport .
my other question would merely repeat the question of brian simpson .
the joint debate on mechanism for strengthening economic order ,
then came 23 april , when an action mechanism wa adopted regarding greece .
however , obviously a short-term strategy is not enough .
this is something that mr harm and mr cohn-bendit emphasise in their question .
it wa discussed at the european council in december of last year .
i shall start with the immediate challenge and the crisis response .
it wa a response that i would call a consolidation pact .
of course , it would be a mistake to stop our effort here .
but the crisis ha shown that we need to acknowledge it systemic shortcoming .
i count on parliament 's support for these important proposal .
we have neither the intention nor the resource for that .
we should prevent and tackle emerging problem before they escalate into a crisis .
instead , it aim at rebalancing economic growth in europe a a whole .
mr president , lady and gentleman , europe ha finally reacted .
this is how we are made , so there have to be penalty .
i myself asked for it in this chamber a few week ago .
that is the third lesson which i have learnt from this crisis .
we must look beyond national consideration and towards european consideration .
the commission , mr rehn , must not be afraid of doing this .
it would be to the benefit of european and of member state .
it should be abolished and these practice should be banned .
the pension fund did not succeed , but it bought something else instead .
this is what you have said , mr lópez garrido and mr rehn .
we have allegedly created an economic and monetary union .
in europe , we have a patchwork quilt of economic policy .
anyone who is still opposed to this ha not heard the warning shot .
we are in the middle of an extremely serious crisis of legitimacy .
this is the situation we are in at the moment .
the first message , mr lópez garrido , is addressed to the council .
for the time being , then , we have a working group .
in my opinion , this is much too late .
are you going to reach a conclusion in june ?
will it be the open method of coordination once again ?
finally , we must have a european bond market .
this is what we are expecting from the commission , mr rehn .
it ha been a tradition for u for many year .
the euro wa not stabilised during the weekend before last .
the share price demonstrated very clearly what had happened .
i would like to summarise the situation very briefly .
we must now make clear decision on certain issue .
we can genuinely guarantee their involvement by introducing the tax .
i am very familiar with this term in a german context .
the introduction of new tax is a taboo subject .
sanction were previously available ; they simply lacked credibility .
increasing their scope doe not make them any more likely to be imposed .
would the new measure be taken any more seriously ?
we are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of european policy .
we have also spoken out in praise of this .
these government have saved casino capitalism using taxpayer ' money .
somewhere , they managed to find eur 750 billion .
the question is whether the money printing press will save economic development .
i believe that it is more likely to save the bank ' capital .
however , i can not yet see any clear outline .
we are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector .
hedge fund must be banned and tax haven abolished .
however , we can not try and stimulate growth at the same time .
those speech did , indeed , run over by some second .
for both of the above , success is dependent on sound european governance .
we do not want any farm to burn down .
we want to take precaution , that is our objective .
secondly , we very much support the measure that mr rehn ha proposed .
however , that is simply not of interest to some people .
therefore , we are calling on the commission and the council to act .
this is an exceptionally serious situation and we need exceptional answer .
we need to see intelligent measure taken by government .
yes , of course , this requires increased mutual supervision between equal .
finally , with regard to financial supervision , i should like to encourage ...
the public sector wa out of control for many year .
what did mr prodi say about the stability pact in 2002 ?
you know : you were the head of mr liikanen 's cabinet .
mr president-in-office ( from spain ) : do we need taxation ?
you have brought the imf back into the european fold .
why , though , do we never talk about existing revenue option ?
are we perhaps headed towards it destructuring within a year or two ?
you have not allowed regulation to be imposed when they were needed .
the commission called for eurostat to be given appropriate power to conduct investigation .
what we really need is , of course , not an emergency government .
the deficit and sanction procedure need to be automated .
the commission should quickly submit a proposal for the european transaction tax .
we in the european parliament are presenting concrete proposal .
please help to make sure that this happens in the council .
in my opinion , we should set two target .
we must do both thing at the same time .
expenditure can be cut or tax can be increased .
your communication last week contained absolutely no mention at all of this issue .
unfortunately , you do not have any plan in this area .
mr verhofstadt wa saying that you had a right to take the initiative .
country failing to do those thing must leave the euro area .
in any case , the eu always take the opportunity ...
this would really just mean going from bad to worse .
i would like to join in mr verhofstadt 's criticism .
it ha not come up with any idea or any incentive .
the commission ha accepted everything that ha been thrown at it .
i can only agree with mr bullmann in this respect .
the crisis is not the 'euro crisis in greece ' .
the first is the asymmetry between the real economy and the financial economy .
europe is not principally built on those thing , but on citizenship .
without that citizen ' europe , this crisis will be impossible to resolve .
sailing a ship through a storm is not easy .
a mr verhofstadt said , we need another way .
it ha just been explained to u that parliament is going too far .
i am rapporteur for the european systemic risk board .
this is exactly what our government have also been doing .
eu 2020 should lay the bill at the right door .
this way , we preserve the european social model .
the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer .
is it europeanist rhetoric if we request new regulation for the financial market ?
the monetary and budget policy have proven inadequate in assuring productivity and competitiveness .
they should have identified these weakness themselves at an early stage .
i am thinking of a variety of crisis which require cooperation and solidarity .
i am not thinking just of financial crisis here .
people have been killed , and there have been heavy material loss .
political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening .
we have been living beyond our mean , especially in some country .
it is not only a crisis of the euro .
let u analyse all the political and electoral process in recent month .
we are talking about the funding of the strategic flagship project europe 2020 .
more regulation is not a guarantee against the risk of the current crisis .
now i am all for free market ; protectionism doe not work .
it is time for political leader to reflect on just what is happening .
i represent the last country to join the euro area .
we must raise awareness that the monetary crisis may have serious political consequence .
last year , large sum of money were injected into bank .
the growth and stability pact ha not been adhered to .
some have decided to tell their citizen the truth and adopt austerity measure .
mr president , i will abide by your rule .
member state could have reacted more swiftly when the banking crisis hit .
finally , the commission is looking for four pillar of a new strategy .
i think the commission need to examine it own role in this crisis .
on the other hand , it provides an opportunity a well .
solidarity and adaptability must be the principle on which it is founded .
they must be adapted according to the possibility of each country .
the first victim wa greece , followed by spain and portugal .
a vein of national self-assertion can certainly be detected here .
by all mean scrutinise other country , but not mine .
scrutinise greece , spain and portugal , but not my country .
joining the eurozone at this moment is not just a privilege .
therefore , i would ask that we plan the future of europe responsibly .
the social market economy wa the successful model behind germany 's economic miracle .
competitiveness is not the start but the result of economic activity .
we all perform better when there is somebody looking over our shoulder .
that applies to government a well a to individual .
we need confidence to achieve this and the people of europe need perspective .
economic governance should now be proposed a a matter of urgency .
personally , i do not think we should switch horse .
i would like to ask : where wa the european central bank ?
the response wa to move forward and adopt a new treaty .
that is the way to respond to this situation right now .
secondly , just today , parliament ha been examining a financial supervision package .
therefore we can do it , of course we can do it .
do not expect anything else ; expect u to do precisely that .
colleague , this is the round-up of a very important debate .
ten page sound short , but it is full of concrete initiative .
this is heavy stuff , which is what we need in europe .
i will come up with concrete proposal , legislative proposal , shortly .
we have taken the initiative and we shall move on .
mr verhofstadt said that we should not wait for the task force .
it is now absolutely essential to move on with these initiative .
the complexity of today 's challenge requires an integrated set of political instrument .
it doe not , however , go far enough .
there are not enough concrete objective and more of them are needed .
it is more than double than what it is in other unemployment category .
almost half of young people are unemployed in latvia and spain .
prediction suggest that there will be a shortage of worker .
i must admit that the minister 's argument is convincing .
i hope these appeal will be heard and put into practice .
i would particularly like to focus at this point on strengthening multi-level governance .
both the world of finance and economic activity no longer know their limit .
these effect are much to be desired and very ambitious .
however , i think this will be difficult to achieve .
the new strategy is based on very ambitious idea .
we would like to extend a warm welcome to the kuwaiti delegation .
we therefore wish mr al-debaqbasi and his colleague a fruitful stay with u .
amending budget no 1/2010 : section i - parliament (
we have been given , for example , document from the year before .
standard of quality and safety of human organ intended for transplantation (
today is a great day for european citizen and for european patient .
parliament 's calendar of part-sessions - 2011 ( vote )
i would like to ask you to reconsider this .
however , this doe not conflict with the amendment tabled by my group .
i would like to ask you to reconsider this .
( fr ) i shall be very brief , mr president .
amendment 2 proposes that this part-session period be postponed to the following week .
a you say yourself , those are the term of the treaty .
it go without saying that any other interpretation merit respect .
however , a the presidency ha to decide , it ha so decided .
food additive other than colour and sweetener ( bovine and/or porcine thrombin ) (
a steak must be a steak and a ham must be a ham .
indeed , it is already used in some country .
secondly , the reasonable technological need for this product ha been established .
the enzyme preparation function a a stabiliser in the final meat product .
firstly , the product can only be sold pre-packed to the final consumer .
if more stringent labelling requirement are indicated , they will be considered .
a a consequence , the consumer would be better informed .
action plan on organ donation and transplantation ( 2009-2015 ) (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i would like to ask you to check whether amendment 4 wa unlawful .
i would really like to clarify that this is unlawful .
we are dealing with explanation of vote concerning the amending budget .
this will cost taxpayer an additional eur 13.4 million per year .
it is not an amendment which only concern accounting .
we have just one or two people to support u .
it is simply a response to a new function , a new role .
all this would make strasbourg more attractive because it is a beautiful city .
what we need is a well-coordinated system of organ donation and transplantation .
to avoid thrombin , it would be necessary to stop eating meat completely .
packaging must include accurate information about thrombin and the labelling must be clear .
to do so would be to open pandora 's box .
is it really the job of politician to manage our food ?
it form part of the blood and therefore of meat .
all of u have a lot of thrombin in our body .
we will be voting on the first reading of this regulation in june .
today , we had to vote on glued meat .
the decision today wa not an easy one for me .
this mean that it may be used but not indicated on the label .
therefore , i think a labelling requirement is not sufficient in this case .
on the other hand , controlling the process would be rather difficult .
( de ) mr president , the citizen of europe are right .
they like honest food and they like honest politician .
we must take notice of what our citizen are saying to u .
this is the basis for effective and fair consumer protection .
i fear that we are getting mixed up in something rather complicated .
all eu member state have ratified the rome statute .
label will contain more energy consumption information for domestic appliance and energy-related product .
nevertheless , the directive seems to have the right objective .
it acknowledges that the market is incapable of ensuring rational energy use .
this is a definite concession that echo our argument , which i welcome .
i also welcome the stated desire for top-down harmonisation of energy saving labelling .
the approval of this directive is especially important in increasing this awareness .
in my opinion , that is particularly important in all area of life .
it provides an important added value for both the market and consumer .
i therefore repeat with conviction that i fully support the directive .
the treaty of lisbon ha given parliament new responsibility .
i voted against the report on the supplementary budget for 2010 .
moreover , it is also fundamental in light of our citizen ' expectation .
the traceability and protection of donor and recipient also deserve special attention .
organ donation must always be free and protected from any potential commercialisation .
however , there are still long waiting list for transplant .
specific training programme should thus be developed for these professional .
for all these reason , we voted for this proposal .
the european parliament ha adopted the calendar of plenary session for 2011 .
a for the 'circus ' , it should obviously stop !
thrombin is used a a 'glue ' in reconstituted meat .
in addition , reconstituted meat could mislead consumer seeking to buy meat .
the commission 's proposal do not fully deal with these reservation .
we therefore deem this resolution worthy of our support .
it is authorised in france and used in black pudding , for example .
food safety and the health of european citizen are at stake .
the key thing here is the safety of substance .
consumer are generally unaware of what is happening and are being deceived .
a mentioned in the report , that increase the risk of meat infection .
i do not think that the food industry should be an exception .
i therefore agree with the opinion expressed in the resolution .
i am very pleased with today 's vote banning thrombin .
i can not quite see how this benefit consumer .
yet thrombin is used in some member state without consumer being informed .
that is not the way for manufacturer to restore consumer confidence .
this is why i voted in favour of this resolution .
what is more , organ are rarely exchanged between member state .
punishment must be particularly severe for health professional or insurance company .
however , there are still long waiting list for transplant .
additionally , there are tight time constraint on organ viability .
thus , an eu-wide network would be of use to very few patient .
this ha been acknowledged by all the rapporteur and group .
lady and gentleman , the statistic speak for themselves .
every day , 12 people die waiting for an organ transplant .
this sensitive issue is linked to various legal and cultural aspect .
it is also important to mobilise and inform society .
for all these reason , i voted against the resolution .
the most serious crime against humanity must be punished .
the international criminal court could be a useful tool in this area .
it is just a question of actually giving it the resource .
a this is not happening , i am abstaining .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
returning to my report : it is an implementation report .
yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research .
if the union invests money , there should also be cooperation between the ...
our report seek to offer three recommendation combined with some operational indicator .
the first is to maintain support measure until the recovery ha been consolidated .
since that vote , the economic health of europe ha deteriorated further .
the ecofin council had to start all over again on monday .
these are the signal that parliament must send out .
thus , a certain flexibility should be allowed for .
the single market integration process is not an irreversible one .
all this need to be achieved within a spirit of compromise and solidarity .
when we talk about europe 2020 , what are we talking about ?
finally , there is also the promotion of social inclusion by combating poverty .
there are also certain requirement where implementation is concerned .
this is the purpose of the integrated guideline proposed by the commission .
these will only be adopted once you have tabled your opinion .
there are other example , and this is a very important undertaking .
europe 2020 mean the willingness to bring about a political union .
europe 2020 is a community union , not a nationalist or obstructive europe .
the citizen are our most important ally in achieving our joint objective .
the decision that we take today must be long-term decision .
youth unemployment in spain , at 44 % , is devastating .
this is important for the european citizen and for u in parliament .
to do this , we absolutely must have european coordination .
but , on the other hand , it is rather an unfocused debate .
well , we do not know the detail of those yet .
it is the biggest single underdeveloped policy that we have .
we have the instrument , but we need to carry them out .
this ha mainly been to the detriment of the european parliament .
we want to introduce a whole raft of specific change .
none of that ha been incorporated into the strategy .
now , that is a fundamental demand which we are dealing with here .
however , the initiative will be useful only if two condition are met .
that proved to be a complete failure , of course .
greece clearly must be expelled from the euro area .
if our analysis is faulty , our solution will likewise be faulty .
europe will not gain in competitiveness without winning the productivity battle .
a great deal more could be done in those area .
this initiative must be reflected in specific measure and integrated guideline .
that is what the van nistelrooij report state and i endorse it .
however , we also to need to improve the guideline .
none of the new country are likely to be contributor .
unfortunately and unfairly , the uk taxpayer is caught up in this .
the comparatively impoverished uk is the second largest contributor to the eu budget .
the 2020 strategy , therefore , miss the point .
for 40 meps , that make two interpreter per person .
however , what is needed is better coordination between them .
it is therefore simply a matter of getting started .
of course we need to come up with a good definition .
do we want young people to have access to the labour market ?
i hope that , a commissioner , you are prepared to do this .
when there were problem there , they called for more socialism .
let u build on a foundation of nation state .
that is precisely the state of affair right now !
nor should the cohesion policy ignore the euro crisis .
all of that should be included in the europe 2020 strategy .
the urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted .
faced with the financial crisis , europe ha not been inactive .
trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the council .
our fellow citizen often ask u : 'what is europe doing ? '
we are at a turning point , fellow member .
it ha been a very interesting report to work on .
the commission ha brought forward very good proposal in recent week .
the commission ha a total lack of ambition in this regard .
hardly a word ha been said about the bank .
however , we must also look at the economy of the future .
the economy of the future will make efficient use of it natural resource .
here , too , the commission ha too little ambition .
we feel the commission 's plan should cover this , too .
at the moment , we are mainly subsidising more greenhouse gas emission .
south wale ha five significant pharmaceutical development company with world-class technology .
we need solution to work effectively for our citizen .
for the sake of the people , eu policy must be urgently refocused .
weakened and indebted state do not have the capacity to protect their citizen .
we must do this or risk compromising our future .
a greater regional dimension is required in the eu 's future strategy .
the challenge facing europe over the next few year are enormous .
small and medium-sized enterprise are the backbone of europe 's economy .
we therefore need to take them seriously in this strategy .
they lack capital and they are finding it difficult to borrow money .
we need to start talking about growth and development again .
otherwise , the future could be even more terrifying .
the same applies to europe - good order provides stability and growth .
all this is happening in the year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
we therefore need a minimum framework of disincentive for redundancy .
both report ultimately stress the positive impact of this measure .
last week 's communication already constitutes a significant contribution to the task force .
this lead me to the two question on the europe 2020 strategy .
many government have neither reduced student support nor scaled back enrolment .
other member state are exploring way to diversify the source of funding .
the commission will continue to watch this issue carefully .
in some country , financial constraint will only appear now .
we will monitor general state budget a well a the efficiency of investment .
we will make sure that we have the resource to reach our target .
people need to be safe and secure in order to be flexible .
the commission must do more to address social dumping .
in fact , we have been consumed by it .
finally , there is a major crisis in youth unemployment .
our party ha never opposed the european support mechanism for greece .
that is why we responsibly supported a different , more effective policy mix .
( fr ) mr koumoutsakos , you do have some cheek !
do you have a reply to this question , mr koumoutsakos ?
( el ) sir , your speech is the result of poor information .
that is how we arrived at today 's drastic situation .
however , it is not the timing which is worst here .
basically , there is nothing supranational about these issue .
they are matter for which individual country are responsible .
the others , quite frankly , are matter for individual member state .
international summit are now ignored ; what will be , will be .
how much longer do people have to endure this cynical approach ?
when will the white-collar criminal of high finance be properly punished ?
it provides european citizen with a visible , quantifiable indicator of solidarity .
all of this earns it rightful place in the europe 2020 strategy .
this name may be very meaningful when discussed by marketing specialist .
these are the point i wish to offer for your consideration .
it should go to the young generation , and their development .
only just under a half of all older worker have a job .
however , a genuine future strategy need a social orientation .
commissioner andor , we are both working on that .
the social security system of member state must be adapted to democratic change .
the eu 2020 strategy will rise and fall with these three pillar .
creativity requires stimulation and development from the earliest year of life .
should we not be more ambitious than we were for the lisbon strategy ?
that will mean a huge burden on national economy .
we should not , however , make a mystery out of debt .
ten year ago , we adopted a strategy , the lisbon strategy .
this is where we should be focusing our effort .
the citizen must be healthy and educated and must have work .
recently , my dog took a sausage from the table and ate it .
is the dog to blame , for doing what is natural to it ?
there are many project right across wale that are benefiting individual and community .
however , i would like to make the following point .
( el ) you are absolutely right mr rapti .
i am greatly concerned about our future together in the eu .
i can not just move on to the agenda without mentioning the crisis .
prosperity and job are not feasible without a secure monetary value .
four out of five european live in urban area .
town and city are the driving force of economic growth in europe .
at the same time , they are experiencing many problem particularly acutely .
three of these seem to me , commissioner , to be priority .
firstly , the eu 2020 strategy must be an inclusive strategy .
there is no doubt that the regional fund contributed to the lisbon strategy .
if we work together , we will be much stronger .
what sort of life will our citizen be able to live here ?
it is also important to make a distinction between cause and effect .
what really are the major issue we face today ?
i think one of them is certainly the ageing of our european society .
firstly , where doe the six-month rotating presidency fit into this ?
european citizen woke up on monday , 10 may to a new europe .
no one can ass it long-term consequence at this stage .
this metamorphosis will not bear fruit if it is not rooted in democracy .
we were united in diversity ; now we must be united in adversity .
i would like to leave this worry behind now .
we are conducting this debate in much too technocratic a way .
this country , the german democratic republic , no longer exists .
the disquiet with such procedure is very much in evidence .
however , the european union today is much more than that .
i should just like to emphasise two particular aspect .
secondly , the coherence between the eu budget and this strategy .
elsewhere , it bemoans the fact that europe ha an ageing population .
it ha also placed the focus on the role of territorial cohesion .
in the next 10 year , energy efficiency must be our top priority .
the commission 's recipe of 'competition or crisis ' unfortunately remains unchanged .
let me also be very clear about the objective of the strategy .
i wish to make two more comment : one about governance .
it ha been asked whose strategy this actually is .
firstly , the ecb can now monetise sovereign debt .
commissioner , we socialist are in favour of federalism .
we are in favour of the coordination of budget policy .
this is the real threat which we are all facing at the moment .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday , 20 may 2010 ) .
structural reform are the key to exiting the crisis we are in .
the cause of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reform .
the eu 2020 strategy also emphasis the interdependence of the various eu policy .
it is also essential to create incentive to investment in local research centre .
we need an open , flexible and dynamic dialogue between everyone involved .
we simply can not afford to remain where we are .
these include the problem connected with intellectual property right and innovation .
economics , aesthetic and technology are in symbiosis with one another .
the basis of an independent university system is adequate public funding .
firstly , i would like to mention the modernisation of the curriculum .
the second thing i would like to mention is mobility .
practical placement should definitely be supported and promoted in europe .
research can also build bridge between university and business .
it thus received absolutely unequivocal support from both party .
education is definitely our priority objective , but what sort of education ?
the result of this is terrible unemployment figure for university graduate .
the key issue , however , is how to achieve these link .
we are all trying to understand the aspiration of our young people .
the unemployment rate among young people is , in fact , unacceptable .
we in the gue/ngl group think that we should listen to them .
do you look for the technological development of the future ?
if so , the scene today is just a promising .
we are living in a time of technical revolution .
what you have presented here in your report is the exact opposite .
the entire report is uncreative and i would even dare to say useless .
that also applies to mr repo and mr vergiat .
we need this cooperation at local , national and international level .
i think that is really what we are talking about .
i would now like to turn to the new partnership for modernising university .
in recent time , i have seen three great example of that .
these partnership must not be confined just to within individual member state .
i , too , wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
after all , business doe not set itself such an objective .
what way are there to put into effect these principle and objective ?
( ro ) i partially agree with the rapporteur .
one of the main reason for this is the lack of money .
however , they are losing their researcher to the american .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 20 may , at 12.00 .
we want a european union based on the central role of the individual .
too many company believe university are impervious to the need of the workplace .
the fact is , skill and knowledge are closely connected and completely interdependent .
the directive ha been announced and i eagerly await it .
finally , i would like to summarise the situation a follows .
consequently , i would ask you to make an effort to slow down .
part of this cost is being compensated by the european union .
this issue wa also mentioned today by commissioner oettinger .
the second matter concern the use of the resource .
i think europe ha a key role to play in this field .
the monitoring of the fund need to be strict .
or can anyone else see any reason in it ?
nonetheless , the commission continues to indirectly fund the nuclear lobby .
we are calling for an end to this bartering with the bulgarian government .
will you allow your fellow member to ask you a question ?
mr parvanova , can you please pose your question a briefly a possible ?
this doe not comply with the rule of procedure .
that question is therefore rejected a is the possibility of a reply .
we are now paying for mistaken judgment within the european union institution .
i hope the commission can give u assurance on this .
i wanted to demonstrate the fact that we are capable of listening .
however , it is just a important to consider people .
this go against the principle of solidarity , which should govern energy policy .
we will be discussing this with mr oettinger in future .
the vote will take place tomorrow , thursday 20 may , at 12.00 .
the eu is dependent on energy import for 53 % of it requirement .
europe 2020 ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
i will give our rapporteur the floor for four minute .
we need to improve the economic and legal environment .
we must not sacrifice the long term to the short term .
since 2004 , political contact have increased in profile and intensity .
this is what we have achieved in our bilateral relation .
mr president , without doubt , the barcelona summit is an uncertainty .
without doubt , the israeli-palestinian conflict is echoing , but never mind .
the region need to increase it economic development and cultural exchange agreement .
the re-launch of the ufm is more urgent than ever before .
we need to bear this in mind for certain future development .
thirdly , adequate resource and financial commitment must be found .
that will help u raise the level of mutual understanding and interconnection .
we need to remember this resolution and parliament 's position .
we must be faithful to our project and to our value .
until they are resolved , these conflict represent a real barrier .
a daily battle is waged on the border of these country .
in practice , however , syria is a dictatorship .
morocco occupies western sahara and in tunisia , human right are regularly flouted .
are these country with whom we wish to have more cultural exchange ?
the outcome of this will be yet more islam in europe .
this is an essential feature of every democratically elected assembly .
we need to become more pro-active on the fundamental issue that concern u .
it is also possible that hamas is profiting from this aid .
there are social and economic difference between mediterranean country .
the challenge is even greater a a result of the economic crisis .
some of these disparity are due to serious deficiency in our neighbouring state .
i would like briefly to raise three further point .
i wa simply attempting to explain what the council said .
it is 10.57 , and at 12.00 we have the vote .
one of these opportunity is the approach to gender equality in society .
it is an area regarded with some sensitivity in this region .
since then , it appears to have lost some of it lustre .
this is principally because of the problem relating to belarus ' participation .
this ha been controversial and discussed this morning in the enlarged bureau .
we worked very hard with the spanish presidency in recent month .
so far , it is funded only by the commission .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to make three brief comment .
thirdly , i too am sorry that the council is not here .
be that a it may , parliament will have assumed it responsibility .
we also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves .
however , the ufm doe , nonetheless , face certain political tension .
the meeting in barcelona will mark our commitment to the mediterranean .
it also includes area such a disaster control , energy and the environment .
the mediterranean region are hard hit by water shortage and drought .
the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus ( debate )
let me underline two very important milestone along this road .
the strategy is vitally important for ensuring a consistent good neighbour policy .
this would lay the foundation for an improved relationship between armenia and turkey .
i think that the approach to adopt is to expand the commercial partnership .
the freedom of the medium is a problem in all the country .
armenia ha now made courageous effort to resolve this long-standing impasse over nagorno-karabakh .
if only turkey itself would respond in a similarly constructive manner without precondition .
so there is enlightened self-interest for turkey to move on this issue .
i would like to highlight very briefly three very specific element .
this would give the business environment and investor a very good prospect .
perhaps we have to work on our geopolitical identity to define it better .
therefore , a package deal should perhaps be considered .
the example of georgia show that such reform have already brought result .
people should not be attempting to maintain the process of displacement .
clearly , that also depends on the behaviour of neighbouring country .
frankly speaking , it is a step which certainly is overdue .
nonetheless , it is a step in the right direction .
we can not accept the archaic principle of region and sphere of influence .
it is very good that we do talk about them .
there is not time for everybody because we must proceed to the vote .
i am , therefore , going to allow only six member to speak .
( pl ) the report on the south caucasus is a good report .
a the european union , we can help these country here .
the area motivates perfectly the general recommendation of the eu security strategy .
that requires our total attention and determination to act .
mr president , i congratulate mr kirilov and mr kazak on their work .
a the example of cyprus show , ankara doe not pull it punch .
i would like to make three very short remark .
otherwise , we risk intervening again when it is already too late .
we should not wait for it to happen again .
the big lesson europe ha learnt is the lesson of integration .
romania is involved in specific project aimed at developing the southern corridor .
we support fully the constructive mission of our special representative peter semneby .
however , we can not limit ourselves to monitoring mission .
this is in accordance with rule 140 of our rule of procedure .
in a crisis situation , democratic force must join together .
mr schulz would like to speak against the proposal .
for example , the people of slovakia have been hard hit by flooding .
now is the time to take up firm position .
you can take up firm position and we will do the same .
the czech republic is also part of the european union .
thank you , too , mr březina , for drawing attention to this .
no one ha objected , so we can vote .
long-term sustainability of public finance for a recovering economy (
mr hoang ngoc , your statement will be noted in the minute .
the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
paragraph 46 rightly state that access to finance is their greatest problem .
i am alarmed at the increasing unemployment among young people .
for the reason mentioned , i support the proposed report .
mr president , i welcome this report on public finance .
it is a vast improvement on the first draft .
finally , we can not hide from our issue of ever-ageing population .
there are some issue that i wa wary of in this report .
migration , for example , need to be handled sensitively .
how detached from the real world can the european parliament actually get ?
our city are already groaning under the problem of mass , uncontrolled immigration .
their problem will become even more severe , resulting in yet more immigration .
following the visit , i wrote an article calling for a mediterranean community .
we must ensure that this is not the case in future .
the economic and financial crisis ha substantially damaged the single market integration process .
nothing ha protected u , least of all the europe of brussels .
today , it is a crisis factor in itself .
the common european market is an important achievement of european union integration .
for these reason , i have voted against this report .
we must not forget the citizen and consumer in our recovery strategy .
i support this report on a more active partnership between university and business .
this own-initiative report contains truly positive idea for the future of our university .
today , knowledge is a greater priority than ever .
information and communication technology are a key instrument in this respect .
it is a neoliberal approach , to which we are opposed .
the eu currently find itself in a very schizophrenic situation .
there are many example of very fruitful cooperation between educational institution and business .
however , the market need quality , not quantity .
i voted for the schmitt report to encourage cooperation between university and company .
the proposal on which we are voting fit into this framework .
this led me to vote against the amended proposal .
ha commissioner oettinger not already committed himself to financing that project ?
the financial assistance adopted here is , therefore , within this framework .
to this end , it will receive approximately eur 860 million in assistance .
however , the resale of atomic waste must be stopped .
there is undeniable potential here for financing and growth for our territory .
however , they can be supported by mean of subsidy programme .
they propose transforming the stability pact into a social regression pact .
today , the right is presenting the invoice to the citizen .
this is a situation which undermines productivity and economic competitiveness .
they have won on all front , increasing their own profit even further .
never mind the consequence for the real economy and the people .
after that , however , an inverse logic is introduced in specific proposal .
let u not bring the citizen of europe to their knee .
these sacrifice must be distributed in a fair and balanced way .
the long-term sustainability of public finance is essential to achieve stability and growth .
financial stability is important for the recovery of the lithuanian and european economy .
we also have to continue to seriously implement our international commitment .
after all , simplicity is one of the key to efficiency .
a i have said , this is an ambitious and daring strategy .
this is crucial for economic development and growth in the different region .
there are problem with subsidy policy throughout the eu .
the rapporteur had achieved a balance between these two aspect .
we in the group of the greens/european free alliance very much regret that .
unfortunately , it did not receive a majority of the vote .
this wa not surprising , given the vote in the committee .
in my opinion , three political point should be considered at that time :
in writing . - we oppose the union for the mediterranean .
this would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished country in north africa .
historically , the mediterranean sea united rather than divided .
the role of elected representative is to strive for the common good .
the south caucasus is strategically important to the european union .
in fact , i bow down deeply before her .
for these reason , i have voted against the kirilov report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
we greatly value his work and the reform that the government ha made .
madam president , freedom of religion is not guaranteed in pakistan .
independent organisation representing working people and the poor are critical .
this is the future direction that pakistan need to take .
pakistan is an islamic country and we must respect that .
i believe that we can put the emphasis on this .
the pakistani telecom authority instructed all internet provider to block the website .
such improvement have not been forthcoming , and the persecution continues .
the blasphemy law pose even more danger to pakistani christian .
first , pakistan is a key strategic player in the fight against terrorism .
we now move to the catch-the-eye part of the debate .
i have had far more request than we can accommodate .
among other question , that of the ahmadis ha also been raised .
unfortunately , benazir bhutto wa assassinated a few week prior to the election .
the pakistan people 's party , which she headed , won these election .
on that occasion , the issue of minority in pakistan wa raised .
the promotion of tolerance is the key to protecting religious minority in pakistan .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on thailand .
medium source such a tv , radio and internet have been blocked .
the train of event ha passed very quickly over recent day and hour .
let u hope that a new spiral of violence can be avoided .
madam president , the 'red-shirt ' demonstration have been suppressed with bloodshed .
firstly , any citizen can legitimately aspire to free and fair election .
the current turmoil run the risk of dividing the country .
part of the thai population is severely disadvantaged and socially excluded .
these people are very critical of their unfair treatment and lack of right .
they are fighting against their comparatively low standard of living .
yesterday , the army intervened , killing several people including an italian journalist .
following heavy military intervention , the leader of the demonstrator have surrendered .
however , the situation in bangkok is continuing to escalate .
i have received phone call about it both yesterday and today .
all the incident must be investigated by an independent commission .
we very much welcome the plan to bring the parliamentary election forward .
there is the risk of these street clash degenerating into civil war .
among the dead , there are medical doctor and child .
there is persistent uncertainty over the future of the country .
these right are threatened by the disproportionate use of force .
thailand is going through a very serious period in it history .
continued uncertainty over his succession suggest that this instability will persist .
the next item is the debate on seven motion for resolution on burma .
this is an obvious attempt to keep the opposition out of the election .
since then , the national league for democracy ha been banned .
we welcome the tone of this resolution calling for increased economic sanction .
we also regret the reduction in humanitarian aid for refugee .
the human right situation in burma is giving particular cause for concern .
however , they will be run based on an undemocratic framework .
the international community must act against the oppressor of the burmese people .
the eu can do much more than just renewing sanction on the regime .
this is something that we can not remain silent on .
we have to establish a clear policy of support for these people .
buddhist monk have long been the target of a special kind of persecution .
the international community need to make an effort to do something .
thirty-one political party have come forward so far to stand for election .
we are also still very concerned about the human right situation .
in addition , the commission ha been in contact with the thai authority .
there is also aid aimed at restoring socio-economic condition in burma .
the content is the same , but the wording is tighter .
we are asking you to vote in favour of this new wording .

mandate for the trilogue on the 2011 draft budget ( debate )
these word of appreciation are first and foremost of a personal nature .
otherwise , they will just stay on paper and be empty word .
i strongly encourage you to endorse the report of the committee on budget .
i would like to thank everyone again for all their contribution .
many of these matter will come back in september a amendment .
they just do not want to pay via the eu budget .
so , should we not make saving in the eu budget ?
please , let u stop this waste of taxpayer ' money now .
i am thinking , for example , of the area of eu agency .
we could also start to make saving in the european parliament .
for example , we could all stop travelling business class within europe .
that could also enable u to make a very reasonable contribution .
with no source of funding , this strategy ha no credibility .
should we spend more or should we spend le ?
the time ha come to show imagination and daring .
i think that is extremely important in this situation .
i will just mention three of these quite briefly .
some are saying that this doe not belong in a budget item .
the third point i would like to mention concern aid .
germany ha announced eur 60 billion of tax rise and spending cut .
we must approach our own with the same sense of responsibility and realism .
our amendment 34 asks the eu to lead by example .
we were voted and elected to listen to the people .
now is not the time to be deaf to their cry .
( hu ) thank you very much , mr president .
the european parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situation .
( hu ) thank you for the floor , mr president .
this is laudable , since these are good and important programme .
( ga ) those are the most important point in my opinion .
firstly , attention ha been paid to the income side of the budget .
we still have a very important moment for reflection before u .
what resource will be left for u to take new initiative ?
the degree of freedom of resource for new initiative is getting smaller .
we have to realise this , and the discussion reflects this clearly .
outside the eu , financial aid for palestine is to be cut .
eight million a year is still a significant amount .
( pl ) firstly , i would like to congratulate mr jędrzejewska .
( de ) mr president , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur .
we will need them if europe is to remain competitive in future .
a basic concern , therefore , is to safeguard resource to finance project .
mention wa made here recently of the iter fusion reactor programme .
a always , the commission will try to act a an honest broker .
it wa mentioned that the money will have to be spent wisely .
this explains the list for our negotiation at the end of june .
once again i would like to thank you for all your comment .
the vote will take place on tuesday 15 june 2010 .
it also fails to give sufficient consideration to the europe 2020 agenda objective .
commissioner lewandowski promised u a budget focusing on young people and education .
sadly , colleague , those commitment have not yet been achieved .
but i have to say the sign are worrying .
without policy coherence our investment in these country will never pay off .
so what i want to see is leadership from the eu .
i want to thank the ngo across europe for supporting my report .
they stand a a common framework to coordinate and check international development activity .
we need to turn aid effectiveness from a good concept into tangible reality .
i am broadly satisfied with the conclusion we have reached .
it is by no mean perfect , but provides a basis for progress .
once again my congratulation on parliament 's mdgs report .
we did not expect our group to manage to reach complete agreement .
these group are in a critical situation in many region .
in ukraine and moldova 300 out of 10 000 people suffer from tuberculosis .
therefore , the time ha come to expand our horizon .
we are facing new challenge and we have to react to them .
this is what ha happened in other part of the world .
i would even have gone further in a few place .
in my view , we have come full circle .
all these example show that development policy is more than a small field .
i would also like to highlight some problem area in the cashman report .
i disagree fundamentally with paragraph 22. you know the reason .
on this point we are always bound to disagree .
taxpayer ' hard-earned money must not disappear into mysterious channel .
i believe that is the right approach and we need to strengthen it .
my memory sadly escape me - it is something to do with age .
think not of u here but think of those outside .
the vote will take place on tuesday 15 june 2010 .
i believe that the compromise we are debating today meet these condition .
every corridor will be managed by an executive board and a management board .
the timetable will still be drafted in accordance with directive 2001/14/ec .
the infrastructure manager have the responsibility to predefine capacity .
it is the practice of simply working together with other country .
we should not normally need to draw up this sort of regulation .
we want to help make freight transport more efficient .
the rail system of tomorrow can not work like this .
in any case , i would like to thank you for your work .
firstly , what we want is competitive rail freight transport .
secondly , we want the regulation to give full added value .
for what is the reason for the poor fortune of the railway ?
there are four problem , for example , with corridor 3 - stockholm-malmö-copenhagen-hamburg-innsbruck-verona-naples-palermo .
we want to stop climate change with an alternative transport policy .
it is then transferred to another lorry for the last stretch .
on the contrary , it complement their work and ensures better coordination .
that would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport .
this is something that we want a well a need .
that is the only source of dissent that we have .
otherwise , we all agree that we need this freight transport in europe .
it is obvious that this might reduce the competitiveness of rail transport .
on the contrary , centralising and fragmenting the responsibility will generate new problem .
i think the point made by mr marinescu is important .
it is a vital link that will link north africa with europe .
we see active participation of all the rail actor .
the compromise is supported by at least four political group .
the compromise is supported by the european association of haulier and infrastructure manager .
there is one point which i would like to mention to you .
the current compromise ha been achieved a a result of difficult negotiation .
conciliation can not give u any more than we have now .
the vote will take place on tuesday 15 june 2010 .
right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceeding ( debate )
this is the first to see the light of day .
in the original trial both the charge and sentence were delivered orally .
vice-president of the commission . - madam president , that is right .
without this trust , mutual recognition will never work properly .
that is why i warmly welcome the agreement reached by the two co-legislators .
what i say now is very important for the future .
this is in accordance with the lisbon treaty and with the stockholm programme .
an agreement could not be reached and negotiation were abandoned in june 2007 .
finally , we have the initiative from the 13 member state .
this meant that the work could be sped up .
this relates to the language which are covered by the directive .
in fact , not one , but two proposal were tabled .
even when it doe exist , this right can vary considerably .
i therefore thank you that it ha gone so well .
( de ) madam president , this report represents progress for europe .
it is a good step towards creating a europe of lawfulness .
everything is in the pipeline and will come quickly .
i strongly agree with vice-president reding about the three-year implementation period .
i hope the new government return fully to the rule of law .
the vote will take place on wednesday 16 june 2010 .
the text we are discussing today is a satisfactory and fully acceptable compromise .
adoption by estonia of the euro on 1 january 2011 ( debate )
the reason why estonia should join the eurozone is straightforward .
estonia ha met the maastricht criterion laid down in the treaty .
i also want to congratulate our estonian friend on reaching this important milestone .
i welcome estonia and i think they are doing the right thing .
there ha to be some way of dealing with that .
i am glad to support the general thrust of the rapporteur 's report .
specifically , this meant several budget cut in 2008 and 2009 .
estonia 's accession is a positive sign to the whole of europe .
the council will also take it decision without any political benefit .
what impact that might have on the budget , we do not know .
they prepared the ground , in fact , for today 's euro crisis .
europe and the euro are currently facing severe problem .
the euro is the most visible symbol of a united europe .
this will make it the 17th country to adopt the euro .
in fact every state ha it own particular historical past .
they have so far succeeded in proving the critic wrong .
the vote will take place on wednesday 16 june 2010 .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the romanian government ha issued an emergency ordinance banning dozen of such substance .
i therefore call the attention of the european institution to this matter .
what a wonder of technology this hidden camera is !
we should erect a monument to it in every country .
this should ring alarm bell in europe , to say the very least .
all military conflict on our continent have been preceded by such comment .
twenty-two execution have been reported in iran for the month of june alone .
some member may be aware of the recent murder of bobby moffat .
i am referring to banana , rum and sugar .
the solidarity of the european union is thus extremely important at the moment .
it is particularly crucial for aid to arrive quickly .
it also ha to modernise the infrastructure of the sea and river port .
almost at the same time , both country are holding parliamentary election .
i am pleased that the hungarian and slovak election have brought anti-communist victory .
we must not forget that pensioner represent a 'captive ' social group .
i am of the view that these general trend should not go unnoticed .
our common foreign policy must be marked by consistency and credibility .
a hungarian proverb say he who give quickly give twice .
it seems that the european parliament is fulfilling this expectation .
moreover , these are boy and girl who speak language .
i have already approached the european commission to ask for this intervention .
the diagnosis wa made almost a soon a the investigation began .
this show how the work of the medium is bearing fruit .
they either remain silent , or they unleash a hate campaign .
derivative market : future policy action ( short presentation )
in the short term , reducing counterparty risk is an important objective .
this can be achieved by using central counterparty clearing house more frequently .
should we demand that they be established in the european union ?
however , we will continue to work on this issue .
personally , mr langen , i am in favour of such an approach .
we will also present a legislative proposal in september .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday 15 june 2010 ) .
in fact , this debate is a debate about the future .
this is a clear political signal and a task for the european commission .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday 15 june 2010 ) .
internet governance : the next step ( short presentation )
thank you very much for listening at this time of night .
( c ) the internet ha so far been managed without government involvement .
from a security perspective , self-regulation is no longer acceptable .
i trust that the european commission will take all of this into account .
( pl ) i would like to offer my congratulation on this report .
of course , freedom in the internet and fundamental right are key principle .
parliament and the commission share many similar idea and goal in this respect .
we should take our responsibility and fulfil our important role .
in any case we can do more together than each on his own .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday 15 june 2010 ) .

there ha been a substantial advance in economic governance .
it is a treaty that seek the closest possible union .
in the same way , we have strengthened neighbourhood relation .
with regard to turkey , chapter twelve wa also opened .
this crisis ha posed u new challenge and required new response from u .
the effort made by all spanish authority have also been crucial .
i therefore strongly believe that the agreement deserves the support of parliament .
the spanish presidency made a significant contribution to achieving the swift agreement .
i have the following to say to the president of the commission .
the credit for this expressly belongs to parliament and the spanish presidency .
we have made considerable progress in this respect in these last few day .
besides , we must have a leading role for europe .
let u look again at the reality of the last fortnight .
the speculative attack on the euro ha been deflected for the time being .
they turn to where they believe they can make their profit quickest .
this is also a step in the right direction .
that is why i believe that the rotating presidency ha proved it worth .
overall , the spanish presidency wa a successful presidency .
thank you for your effort and thank you for your attention .
this wa absolutely the correct approach in the crisis .
there are also problem in the council when it come to financial supervision .
the crisis ha shown that this approach ha failed .
the council should not stand in the way of efficient european financial supervision .
much the same go for the eu 2020 strategy .
here , too , we need more european cooperation .
the new strategy doe not do this to a sufficient degree .
there is one final comment i should like to make .
mr president , i shall make no remark about football .
i know you are all too clever for that .
i shall only say it is a pity that ghana ha been eliminated .
we can all agree on that , can we not ?
we are always saying we want growth , growth , growth .
those who want growth can not only get growth by saving .
yes , but it must be a fund for solidarity and investment .
i have not heard it mentioned once in any of the speech .
i have heard nothing about that today - not a word .
i would like to reiterate something with regard to swift .
mr schulz , this house ha decided on a single paragraph on swift .
that is nonsense , since the police have to work with each other .
turning to the economy , the spanish presidency ha been virtually invisible .
at the end of the 1980s , the washington consensus moved to brussels .
you began with the resounding failure that is the lisbon strategy .
we must row together , otherwise the european union may slide towards irrelevance .
in no case should we be disunited in the face of adversity .
from now on , every presidency must think globally , not locally .
in addition to prestige , leading these project requires authority and recognition .
we will continue demanding a voice for europe 's region .
swift is not good news to me ; it is very bad news .
the spanish presidency ha left no enduring trace , mr zapatero .
not even the president of this house wa involved .
we have no concrete progress on the stability and growth pact .
so , this is hardly a successful report card .
that would assist the inner coherence of your argument .
it is the spanish presidency that we are discussing .
mr zapatero said he ha accomplished everything in good faith .
we could still do that too , mr schulz .
i see that you agree with the 'final solution ' for catalan .
i conclude with some verse by machado , inspired by your frivolity .
where are the measure to guarantee fulfilment of the europe 2020 strategy ?
in which document have you established the mediterranean axis a a priority ?
many of u have spent a lot longer putting up with this model .
mr zapatero , do not resent these word of open criticism .
session had , at best , an informal character .
one had to collect document bit by bit , or they were unavailable .
for this , it deserves the praise of this house .
however , it wa up to you to demand obedience to these rule .
unlike me , you have had time to talk about them .
at best , this presidency ha been sadly irrelevant .
the spanish presidency delivered what wa expected concerning the most important institutional issue .
the spanish also met high expectation on democratic right .
this is something which cause u very great concern .
this crisis ha hit the country holding the presidency very hard .
last week 's economist asked : 'is there life after debt ? ' .
earlier , we heard criticism about issue relating to spanish property .
the spectre of financial collapse also hung over spain itself .
unfortunately , not a great deal of this proved possible to achieve .
the spanish presidency ha also embarked on economic governance .
the belgian and hungarian presidency will have to continue this policy .
however , in my opinion , we have other thing to do here .
let u , therefore , look at the fact .
yes , yes , let u look at the fact .
however , in the end , that is how thing are .
we will fulfil each and every one of our commitment .
we will work and do whatever is in our power .
we have felt supported by you , mr president .
we have felt understood by you , encouraged by you .
how would the rotating presidency interpret the treaty of lisbon ?
the treaty of lisbon stand for more europe , not le europe .
and the spanish presidency 's interpretation favoured more europe .
we must be united in order to strengthen our european project .
this also prof who hold power in the european union after all .
the approval of the europe 2020 strategy will mean taking the same approach .
the crisis in greece slowed down realisation of the presidency 's objective .
it wa impossible to alter certain thing , or to reopen the agreement .
internal european bank data transfer will also largely not be conducted via swift .
these are instead sepa data , which are explicitly excluded from the agreement .
it decided on 11 february 2010 to reject the interim agreement .
the new agreement wa approved on 28 june 2010 .
one thousand five hundred dossier have already been handed over in that way .
i would like to thank all of you wholeheartedly .
the rapporteur laid out the provision that we will take .
the london bombing took place exactly five year ago .
i must especially thank the rapporteur for having done a good job .
it is a new start , a mr malmström said .
we all know what this agreement is about , but balance is critical .
better an eu deal with real safeguard than bilateral agreement with unknown consequence .
it represents for u the future possibility of our own eu tftp system .
it is certainly more equal , more open and more democratic .
last night in committee , this agreement wa overwhelmingly adopted .
now is the time for u to behave reasonably and responsibly .
mr president , lady and gentleman , what are we talking about ?
therefore , there are good reason for continuing to vote against it .
the american law is not changing ; it is not passing through congress .
you have created an illegal state and now you are making illegal law !
the usa can not be trusted to observe other nation ' right .
they have no right to share it with the usa or anybody else .
the global jihad pose an increasing threat to the world .
it wa a terrible stench ; the stench of terrorism .
with this agreement , we have done just this .
we have shown that we can have them both .
we have shown that we can strike a fair balance .
( de ) mr president , a preliminary remark .
to accept or to reject , either decision is worthy of respect .
more objectivity and le emotion would surely have been fitting .
this agreement ha serious shortcoming which leave it open to legal challenge .
concluding international agreement that are not legally watertight is a risky strategy .
an increase in data protection is thus nowhere in sight in this agreement .
the commission ha an essential role to play in promoting this .
i do not seriously believe that we can reject this agreement .
( c ) i reject the argument put forward by the opponent .
( hu ) i will indeed keep this one short .
from now on , the legal remedy offered will be transparent .
we also said that an independent court could change a decision .
however , my opposition to this treaty is not limited to it content .
mr president , lady and gentleman , this ha been an impassioned debate .
we must keep a close eye on this balance .
compromise is the very essence of the community method .
considerable improvement have been made concerning data protection , fundamental right and integrity .
mr garrido ha stated that he had underestimated the european parliament .
now i turn to my fellow member who have just spoken in opposition .
the vote will take place on thursday , 8 july , at 12:00 .
this agreement meet the demand expressed by parliament a few month ago .
the content of this agreement are testament to these new institutional relation .
our concern have been heard , and reasonable answer have been found .
the re-hashed swift agreement doe very little to change this situation .
the data will be arbitrarily stored for a full five year .
even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied .
many question remain open and in need of answer .
request for defence of mr valdemar tomaševski 's parliamentary immunity (
quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure (
sanction against member state which falsify statistic and supply false statistic .
right of passenger when travelling by sea and inland waterway (

atypical contract , secured professional path and new form of social dialogue (
commission green paper on the management of bio-waste in the european union (
now we have the nemesis of the overdue market correction .
the position that elastic financing must continue to be developed should be supported .
i am particularly concerned about the area of rural transport .
maritime good transport is indeed subject to very complex administrative procedure .
it is not , however , enough on it own .
( lt ) youth unemployment is a particularly acute problem today .
20 % of people my age are unemployed in the european union .
then there are the objective of the european union 's eu 2020 strategy .
the situation varies from one eu member state to another .
therefore , adequate legal regulation is required at european union level .
it constitutes a general framework , and i agree with it aim .
this is an issue which i think is very important .
i voted in favour of this recommendation , with which i wholly agree .
at present , 24 member state have integrated this convention .
that is why i voted in favour of the resolution .
it also precisely regulates individual country ' custom regulation for the imported good .
in this way , country are obliged to admit the good .
for exhibitor , this mean a considerable simplification of entry procedure .
the iczm protocol ha already been approved on behalf of the european union .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
our every effort to strengthen frontex is therefore to be welcomed .
i am opposed to the existence and overall modus operandi of frontex .
therefore , i am voting for the ep position .
member shall vote on an individual and personal basis .
the european union ha learnt a lesson from greece 's experience .
this report advocate absolute respect for the stability and growth pact .
it go without saying that this is a scandal .
standardising of statistical and budgetary information supplied by the member state ;
the baltic sea strategy is the first attempt to make use of macro-regions .
this elimination is necessary for the preservation of our ecosystem .
it must be carried out a quickly a possible .
the implementation of the strategy ha been slow so far .
we need to kick-start the process and step up our effort .
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very well drafted report .
russia , belarus and norway should be involved in this cooperation .
interdisciplinary cooperation is needed here , including in the european parliament committee .
this macro-regional strategy for the baltic sea is a pilot project .
today , all the actor in our region are affected by the crisis .
i join the rapporteur in emphasising the particular importance of objective 2 .
this is vital for facilitating the convergence of all the european region .
it also provides the perfect condition for entrepreneurship and developing smes .
this is to be done within the regional policy budgetary framework .
no proper impact assessment have been carried out in this regard .
they currently overlap one another , resulting in a lack of clarity .
it is important that these instrument are not solely used a fire-fighting intervention .
however , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on amendment 14 .
all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
i support this regulation concerning passenger right in bus and coach transport .
these service should also be accessible to people with disability ;
i therefore fully support mr cancian 's proposal and his very well-balanced approach .
i am sure that the council ha taken note of our determination .
in writing . - the concern with the report voted are the following :
all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
the complaint system should be accessible and clear to passenger .
this mean that there need to be investment in terminal and port .
these passenger should also have the opportunity to submit compensation claim .
the netherlands itself is best placed to make tailored policy .
i hope that an acceptable compromise can be reached in conciliation .
the correct functioning of the internal market must be ensured .
better public management of infrastructure and transport policy development will also be crucial .
if intelligent traffic system are actually implemented , they must be interoperable .
i am pleased that it wa adopted with a resounding majority .
thus , the formality required by eu legislation should be simplified and harmonised .
creating a large european transport area without barrier is essential .
the eu airline industry is already in dire strait .
better performance and higher environmental standard are being sought in this report .
transport is responsible for 25 % of co2 emission in europe .
the transport sector is of great importance in the european internal market .
the report call for safer , more efficient transport which cause le pollution .
in other word , nothing but very conventional and very obvious thing .
today 's vote call for more joined-up thinking across the whole of europe .
it also contributes to the development and consolidation of the internal market .
we are a far away a ever from achieving sustainability in transport .
this report is basically almost a rehash of old , unfulfilled strategy .
we look positively on the heavy emphasis on safety .
this report will affect a forthcoming green paper on an integrated transport policy .
unfortunately , however , the finance allocated to this sector are inadequate .
there is more to transport than merely truck , traffic and tariff .
i wa pleased to hear the result of today 's vote .
the grosch report ha proposed the achievement of unusually ambitious objective by 2020 .
i have doubt about the proposal to create a transport fund .
i believe that it is vital to create incentive for greater participation .
it is clear that european legislation ha a direct impact on the public .
i voted in favour of the annual report by the committee on petition .
this is therefore an instrument of democracy and citizenship .
my amendment to the text were inserted in this vein .
our youth could become a lost generation with the current crisis .
youth unemployment is one of the most pressing problem facing europe .
it is certainly important to tighten the regulation on internship .
the key factor should be the duration of an internship .
from then on , remuneration should also be paid .
the decision made today is impracticable and go too far .
we therefore do not support this part of the resolution .
youth unemployment is one of europe 's most pressing problem .
i voted today for the own-initiative report on combating youth unemployment .
a european quality charter on internship is to be proposed .
i am therefore in favour of promoting the status of internship .
this sends out a clear signal to our young european .
we often say that young people are the future of europe .
unemployment among young people is one of europe 's most pressing problem .
it is mainly young people and woman who are affected by unemployment .
the actual process of getting on the job ladder is becoming increasingly difficult .
insecure job mean that we should not be surprised at low birth rate .
in an ideal world , youth unemployment would be outlawed .
since 2000 , youth unemployment in brussels ha never fallen below 30 % .
this is because we always remember our first salary .
we must also ensure that these are of good quality .
the report wa adopted with a large majority in favour .
addressing this is an important task for responsible politician .
these have a greater impact on young people and woman .
all worker should have access to equal treatment regardless of their employment contract .
inflexible model of labour law have proven to have failed .
more than a fifth of european worker change their job every year .
this allows u to send out two clear message to the labour market .
atypical employment contract must remain the exception in europe .
the fast pace of structural change necessitates more flexible form of working .
the abuse of atypical employment breach the european social model .
the european union is facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
there wa , unfortunately , no chance to secure a majority for it .
the incidence of atypical employment contract is increasing significantly in the european union .
there must not be two class of employment contract .
allow me to give you one example of this .
to achieve this objective , citizen themselves need to be involved .
selective collection and recycling of bio-waste is essential to europe 's sustainable development .
treatment of waste is a problem that affect europe and all of humanity .
i am therefore voting in favour of this report 's proposal .
ever greater area are experiencing irreparable soil degradation here .
however , bio-waste almost always end up in landfill .
the question unanswered in the report is : who will pay ?
reduction is one of the best way of combating problem related to waste .
bio-waste can also be reused to produce bio-energy and biofuels .
this mean that sustainable development can be promoted through efficient resource management .
this wa included in the recital of the text adopted in committee .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
commissioner olli rehn then discussed this with you during his hearing .
unfortunately , the crisis ha shown that we were right .
a a result , the commission provided detailed proposal on 12 may .
we must act now , within the legal context that we have today .
it is our responsibility to decide and to act now .
our response to the crisis is a holistic one .
but for now , let me focus on governance .
we have the treaty provision in place which allow u to act .
we faced a real risk and we successfully resisted it .
our debate since then are reflected in the commission communication of 30 june .
this work ha helped to build a real european momentum .
second , we need the credibility that come with better enforcement .
third , our surveillance need to capture all the key element .
it must not be restricted to fiscal policy alone .
we have seen that such a narrow perspective doe not work .
we must have tool to detect macro-economic imbalance among member state .
this will create job and prosperity for our citizen .
you called the series of measure a 'toolbox ' .
a great deal will depend on the specific content of this toolbox .
one of our dutch football team ha the motto 'deeds not word ' .
taxation on labour is far too high in a number of member state .
nevertheless , mr president , some question remain concerning this package .
we can not just say that we will reduce the deficit .
furthermore , this element is repeated in the commission 's proposal .
this is the point of departure for the larosière exercise .
mr president , many thanks for making this statement .
until recently , it wa still almost impossible to talk about imbalance seriously .
this obviously mean economic governance and also talking about tax issue .
unfortunately , this doe not feature in the text .
it is no longer enough now to make progress in this crisis .
the recent financial and economic crisis ha necessitated bold measure .
regulation of the financial market is a matter of urgency .
we will do our part to resolve the situation .
you are in such a pickle actually , are you not ?
i am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro .
it wa always written in the rune , a it were .
they redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple a rating .
you had promised the convergence and the harmonisation of the european country .
today , you are rushing u towards a social and political explosion .
first of all , to corien wortmann-kool , thank you for your support .
so our proposal is not only about prudence in macro-economic aspect .
what is going on is a very important reform .
we will also try to reinforce coordination in term of the macro-economic imbalance .
we need this since our whole reform is based on this new architecture .
there is a predominant sense of constructive pragmatism on both side .
i am grateful for the ambition parliament ha been demonstrating .
we now call on both colegislators to maintain the positive dynamic .
president obama said in the g20 that he got a bipartisan agreement .
that could only enhance the role of europe in this matter .
finally , some of you spoke about stress testing .
a fully transparent stress test provides the opportunity to do so .
so , a you see , we are acting on several front .
in writing . - i welcome the proposal made by the commission .
however , control mechanism are not a solution but just a mean .
the solution is in more efficient work , entrepreneurship and innovation .
special attention should be paid to budgetary framework and the state debt .
the new dual system of incentive and sanction deserves support .
reliable and timely data is a crucial component to making the right decision .
this is all the result of illogical and unclear tax legislation .
this ha led to the bankruptcy of many business and commercial structure .
in essence , the state is depriving entrepreneur of their liquid fund .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
all competence and power have been incorporated into the sectoral legislation .
since then , we have had a wide-ranging discussion about many issue .
this is the decision we have come to now in parliament .
the regulation of derivative will create new european market infrastructure .
then we have the long debate about direct decision right .
since then , the commission ha done it work .
on this question , i would nevertheless like to make a comment .
on this matter , we have also made some request .
we have also asked for greater openness from these body .
i would like to say one final word relating to the united state .
we refuse any new stage of integration and we decry the community method .
then , later , we always compare ourselves to the united state .
there come a time when we have to abide by our responsibility .
madam president , cassandra had a gift : that of telling the future .
she also bore a curse : that of not being listened to .
we did not take heed of this , and the crisis erupted .
exotic product , unknown even to their creator , flooded the market .
there are several idea that parliament would like to highlight .
what doe it mean to say that they are european ?
national supervisor can not be feudal lord invested with absolute power .
this is a sign of the strength of this house .
i ask the council to listen to cassandra for once .
today , cassandra is the rapporteur who have spoken .
those who are not cassandra know only too well to whom i refer .
do not say one thing here and another there .
a such , solvency ii is intimately linked with the proposal for eiopa .
they will not be different but they will be balanced .
for pension , the question is up in the air .
we need to attribute wider power of intervention to the supervisor .
this entire process take time for 27 member state .
a you well know , the latest trialogue actually took place yesterday evening .
should the president of the efc participate in the work of the esrb ?
there again , an agreement is not far away .
i count on your support on these very important endeavour .
there is also financial corporate governance and banking capital .
i will come back to this when talking about mr karas ' report .
first , i will address supervision , which is effectively the backbone .
we find here the spirit and the philosophy of the commission 's proposal .
i want to repeat what mr garcía-margallo y marfil said .
i have myself believed in precautionary measure for a long time .
i make the commitment that a legislative text will be presented to you .
there have been different approach adopted at national level .
a regulation at the european level is useful , but insufficient .
our member state are right to resist such a move .
the uk and germany are right to adopt the position that they have .
let u now begin the debate with the political group speaker .
we are dealing with market which operate globally nowadays .
all of this doe not seem to me to amount to extremism .
i can think of no other name for that than a political federation .
we need to do something without giving you a say . '
in my opinion , that is the wrong approach .
all the proposal we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues .
the council and the government do not want strong intervention right .
this would be just the first step to a status quo ante .
finally , i am convinced that politics should take more responsibility .
every year , these organisation gobble up eur 1.5 billion .
most of all , there is frequently no rationale given for these agency .
in this debate on european supervision , parliament ha played this role .
they are also concentrating more on substance than on a turf war .
standardised derivative will be traded on established exchange and forced through clearing-houses .
furthermore , why should the headquarters of the european agency be in frankfurt ?
i am glad that it appears that we are close to agreement .
we should all , and the rapporteur themselves , be very proud .
the european financial supervisory authority must be provided with extensive power .
they must not degenerate into empty shell which passively observe market development .
there ha certainly been no lack of preparatory work by the responsible meps .
( hu ) the crisis ha taught u all some painful lesson .
the new supervisory authority will serve exactly this purpose .
finally , ecofin should be granted the right to announce an economic crisis .
therefore , it seems to me that our responsibility is clear .
we need independent , strong authority in the interest of european .
the proposal tabled by the commission already provides a minimum scenario .
we require banking supervision a part of crisis management .
the safeguard clause is an obstructive instrument and contravenes community solidarity .
we want to keep systemic risk permanently to a minimum .
if they fail to perform , they have somebody to answer to .
i will report all those matter to him which may concern him directly .
mr bowles reminded u of the need for early intervention measure .
we are indeed carrying out this reform for the citizen .
this is very much a reform for the citizen .
you reminded u of the importance of applying our rule properly .
i could imagine an important coordinating role for the authority in this area .
the council also accepted that the authority may have such a role .
this ha to do with the transatlantic calibration that i sometimes mention .
i am not worried about the energetic interaction between american and european .
i think that there are real parallel between the american and the european .
in the united state , it is the other way around .
we do not always have the same banking structure .
those who advocated self-regulation in the past now need to accept self-financing .
they have done an excellent job , which ha not yet borne fruit .
it is a pity therefore that my fellow member are no longer present .
i hope that this signal is also clearly understood by the absent council .
otherwise , we are all going to find it very uncomfortable next week .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to say three thing .
this parliament agreed to interrupt the procedure of first reading .
my second remark ha to do with the date .
we do not want 1 january for it own sake .
we have the advantage that we anticipated thing that other institution said later .
he replied 'no , it 's much more serious than that ' .
i would like to thank everybody who ha participated in this .
on an international level , we should be proud too .
however , i do not necessarily agree with you on international financial accounting .
nevertheless , on supervision , the rapporteur deserve a pat on the back .
we have gone through full time , we are now in extra time .
let u hope it doe not have to go to a penalty shoot-out .
i will try to be very brief here in underlining just four point .
the european union ha a political , social and moral duty to intervene .
the economy can only function with healthy financial market dedicated to it .
a bit more haste would have been useful , and perhaps cheaper .
how will the coordination between the stabilisation fund and the imf operate ?
what is the link with the ceiling on own resource ?
notably , it will include an impact evaluation of the text .
it will not lend or borrow on behalf of this mechanism .
no exact choice of legal basis ha yet been made .
you have just mentioned the question of the role of the european parliament .
the sixth question : what is the coordination with the international monetary fund ?
the eighth and final question relates to the choice of legal base .
however , i wish to say the following on the subject .
the financial stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of financial market reform .
in the meantime , the market have done their job .
our fellow member , othmar karas , spoke of the stability pact .
we now move on to the speaker in the catch-the-eye procedure .
besides , the issue arises concerning the dependency of rating agency .
i believe that this is the crux of stabilisation .
any reduction of this programme would be totally counterproductive .
would you have a suggestion to make on this ?
i would simply like to ask you a question , commissioner .
he will do this in writing in the next few day .
however , this is only a tool , mr karas .
mr berès mentioned the application of the stability pact .
like you , i think that we must go further .
the commission ha also made important proposal relating to budgetary surveillance .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 7 july 2010 at 12:00 .
it is therefore imperative that these rule on bonus apply in 2011 .
we have a duty to respond to the public 's concern .
a proportion of variable remuneration should be paid out over a sufficient period .
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
i agree with your observation , mr el khadraoui .
there must be binding measure on the remuneration policy of financial institution .
i recently put forward an international agenda for a financial regulation for growth .
we shall open a two-month period of genuine consultation on all these issue .
thirdly , there is the matter of the modernisation of capital treatment .
i have just referred to crd 3 and the issue of remuneration .
madam president , lady and gentleman , the council is again absent .
the european parliament is in favour of clear european regulation .
we are in favour of payment method involving le risk .
we do not want cash amount to be higher than the tied-up capital .
we have managed to get our way with splitting the timetable .
we support this compromise a it take u further in the right direction .
on the other hand , there have been very few specific measure .
that will reduce the risk level and increase stability .
it is too risky for society to largely accept the status quo .
yes , i mean up there alongside the supervisory architecture .
therefore , i think that this is an achievement which we can share .
now , there is an important issue at stake .
a we lost , we have had to make compromise .
we have here a regulation which is unique on a global scale .
thank you to all fellow member for their cooperation on this report .
in the end , we succeeded in achieving a relatively balanced result .
for example , text and annex must remain consistent .
calculation example in the annex must also match the wording .
however , the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation .
there is one other thing we should not forget .
the financial economy and the real economy are not two self-contained system .
capital requirement regulation have an impact on the real economy .
it will not be that easy to put an end to this .
the eu draft should draw a lesson from this .
the factor determining the bonus must definitely be transparent .
madam president , i would like to thank the rapporteur and the commission .
clear rule have been implemented which can not be interpreted in different way .
this includes , mr canfin , decision on rule relating to remuneration .
mr christensen , you stressed the need for transparency .
mr president , lady and gentleman , i too shall keep it brief .
it can not be the end of the story .
it is clear that there is still work to be done .
the role of the shareholder must also be strengthened .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 7 july 2010 ) .
the next item is question time ( b7-0316/2010 ) .
the eu staff regulation foresee disciplinary procedure for breach of this obligation .
i would therefore ask , commissioner , that you monitor the selection procedure .
perhaps it would be helpful if i outlined how that wa .
subject : european union accession to the european convention on human right
( pl ) thank you , mr šemeta , for your answer .
technically and legally , i understand the commissioner 's response .
we need a peer review system ; we need monitoring mechanism .
well , let u hope that it doe not take too long !
subject : international cooperation on tax haven and offshore company
this could also allow u to make progress in dealing with tax evasion .
doe the commissioner have a comment to make on that ?
i hope that we will be able to make progress in this area .
the first part of your question wa not very clear .
i will leave the question to the comment of those who made them .
the commission ha been providing significant financial assistance since 2000 .
we intend to include kosovo-montenegro a well , starting next year .
you yourself come from a wonderful region of europe , euregio egrensis .
subject : full implementation by turkey of the association agreement and the additional protocol
ha turkey made any commitment to sign the protocol in 2010 ?
( el ) commissioner , thank you very much for your reply .
indeed we have been pushing for a debate on the mercosur bilateral talk .
i totally agree with what mr mcguinness ha just said .
it will provide a much wider opportunity for debate and discussion .
but let u see how we get on , mr gallagher .
the united nation framework offer an opportunity for such talk .
the european union ha no competence to intervene in such case .
a mentioned earlier , this is an issue for internal cypriot dialogue .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
do we not need a new way of communicating our message ?
i apologise to baroness ludford , who ha now left the chamber .
subject : infringement of fair trade rule by european importer
one of their biggest asset is that they are non-governmental in nature .
i would also recognise that there is considerable scope for consumer confusion .
i am pleased to hear that you are going to coordinate .
a the author is not present , question 34 lapse .
i have heard what the commissioner said about the suspension clause .
i want to know if any assessment ha been made .
we are going to continue to monitor this very closely .
in the end , it is a political assessment .
you know what the remedy are ; they are the right one .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.30 and resumed at 21.00 )
the manufacturer would like to place this on the market .
a food should not reach our plate unless it safety is guaranteed .
now for the stumbling block : meat from cloned animal and their offspring .
in other word , there is little sign of respect for animal welfare .
we must not produce any unpleasant surprise at the last moment .
i look forward to hearing the view of the member .
it deal with novel food and new process for manufacturing foodstuff .
i hope and trust that this will be the case .
the effect of nanomaterials on the human body are unknown .
we must do our utmost to guarantee safe consumption .
we represent citizen and we must not forget this fact .
is it the industry that want to sell more product ?
unfortunately , however , the reality is much duller .
the following important reason were put forward during the discussion in the group .
it contains so many unanswered question , justifying this sense of unease .
they often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible disease .
animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willy-nilly .
the author of the treaty have imposed this on u .
commissioner , i believe that you said that we have a consensus .
with novel food , we need prior authorisation before they enter the market .
we are not calling for a ban on gmos and nanomaterials .
a great deal ha already been said about meat from cloned animal .
an agreement wa not reached between the party during the trialogue .
we all know about the extremely rigorous cross-compliance rule .
this is how we can recognise the benefit of certain healthier novel food .
the european commission ha pledged to put a proposal to u .
do we not already have enough rule governing food ?
we must not stand in the way of progress .
i look forward to finding out what will be put before u .
these animal have suffered premature ageing or other disease .
most cloned organism have not survived or have died prematurely .
the success rate is one viable organism in 75 cloning attempt .
firstly , the legislation must have a scientific basis .
the citizen of europe have a right to demand that .
this is at complete odds with innovation and development .
the situation in the european union regarding our meat supply is adequate .
meat from cloned animal is definitely not a priori harmful .
however , risk can not always be excluded either .
not everything that can be made is also for mankind 's benefit .
there must be no cloned animal in the food chain .
another important topic in this regulation is the rule on nanotechnology .
the precautionary principle must apply in particular in the food sector .
a the european parliament we should , during the forthcoming second reading , ...
we certainly do not need meat from cloned animal .
our european citizen , who are our consumer , reject this product .
nanotechnology have become widely used in food processing across the world .
is there perhaps a shortage of meat stock in europe ?
well , we will be able to say in 50 year .
it took century to work out that penicillin could come from mould .
doe europe , perchance , say yes to everything ?
animal , moreover , should not suffer for human health .
the first is the environmental requirement in industrial plant .
it also provides u with the opportunity to stimulate eco-innovation .
i am pleased that we succeeded in achieving this .
this place germany at a competitive disadvantage compared to others .
this is an argument that can apply to many aspect of environmental legislation .
the question is that we have now recast this legislation .
my member state , the united kingdom , ha got off the hook .
at the end of the day , however , we are making progress .
we have reached , in the end , what is an acceptable compromise .
certainly some member of this house are very unhappy .
at the end of the day , that is always the consumer .
this commitment ensures that this varied reality will be observed .
unfortunately , the electricity market is not yet a single market .
around 95 % of the polish energy sector is based on coal .
adoption of the krahmer report will put enterprise in a difficult situation .
this should be made to apply only to new investment .
it lead to unsustainable development and unfair competition within the european union .
installation which come under the remit of this directive must be authorised .
i would like to congratulate all of the negotiator .
we need concrete and compact guideline which establish eu-wide minimum standard .
( ro ) i approve of the compromise text resulting from the trialogues .
these derogation concern case where investment cost outweigh environmental benefit .
flexibility is still possible but must now be clearly justified .
the commission can collect information on the use of this flexibility .
you are probably aware that our proposal wa for a shorter time .
who exactly it will be , we will see .
i do not want to express any preference now .
the second is that germany is receiving compliment from the united kingdom .
however , congratulation to our dutch friend , of course .
a an east german , i am also half-eastern european .
those which do not do this will become le competitive .
. - mr krahmer , congratulation on your excellent work .
industrial activity requires a high level of environmental protection .
loss to industry may be a high a pln 50 billion .
this is four year shorter than poland had expected .
extending the transitional period would make technological conversion easier for small heating plant .
introduction of the directive will also affect the life of ordinary citizen .
these operator must be aware of the wood 's origin .
the challenge remains a to how we detect illegally harvested timber .
the proposal in front of you deserves your support .
however , i must say that we worked well together .
i would also like to thank the spanish presidency .
i had three thing in mind when working on this issue .
secondly , it must be possible to implement the legislation .
i think that we have achieved a great deal .
i see many friend here who fought hard with u .
we would do well not to underestimate the success there .
it is possible to come to such agreement when we all work together .
i would like to highlight one of the very welcome side effect .
it follows on nicely from what jan wa just saying .
parliament must adopt strong and consistent measure in this fight .
so what we are doing today is a first step .
i would like to thank the commissioner for going further than his predecessor .
it can be done , and here we have proof of it .
this is excellent , this is good news and an important measure .
this wa on the table at the beginning of the debate .
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance .
this is not only applicable to felling , and it will not work .
it produce bureaucracy and , above all , produce new risk .
we must ensure that the law remain balanced and feasible .
in this sense , this compromise is a good one .
that , too , is now something to make u apprehensive .
this is an important example of how we should not work .
we have quite a bit to do in this area in the future .
we are clearly dealing with a proposal of a noble nature .
the company should have the document needed for this in any case .
it is required , for example , under the law on vat .
they need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice .
nowadays , 20-30 % of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal source .
we need to clean up the european timber market a soon a possible .
in many case , we see illegal extraction even in european union country .
this is linked to the management of animal , especially the taller one .
illegally harvested timber and timber product have no place on our market .
large-scale logging drive people from the area where they live .
corrigendum to a text adopted ( rule 216 ) : see minute
industrial emission ( integrated pollution prevention and control ) ( recast ) (
iceland 's application for membership of the european union (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
i believe this to be an extremely positive detail .
why is it still relevant in the 21st century ?
yes , we still need intervention and private aid to storage .
that ha already been tried and it ha failed .
i think that food production is an important objective of the cap .
the issue of generational change will be one of our concern .
this , of course , includes finding food for nine billion people .
let u not see agriculture a an environmental villain and environmental problem .
agriculture and forestry hold the fundamental solution to our huge problem .
previous cap reform have led to the liberalisation of agricultural market .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
farmer are required to produce more and more with le and le .
everything else is very worthy , very desirable , but secondary .
we must face up to this problem and solve it .
we can not continue with such great difference in the long term .
currently the largest proportion go to big owner and to producer .
these system can operate and become widespread throughout the european union .
the cap must continue to be based on it two pillar .
however , farmer need support to be able to comply with these standard .
the common agricultural policy must remain a common european policy .
secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to the future cap .
lastly , european farmer produce food to the highest quality and standard .
bulgarian and romanian will receive a mere 40 % .
i firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminated a soon a possible .
mr president , i declare an interest a a working farmer .
my final point concern the first and the second pillar .
commissioner , i would like to finish with a simple idea .
the cap wa created at the same time a the european economic community .
i really feel that we ought to have a major policy ...
finally , it need to deliver value for money .
i congratulate him on his work and am happy to support .
choice without an alternative is no choice at all .
commissioner , our farmer will once more have to make effort to adapt .
any change that do take place must be accompanied by realistic transition period .
if they are ended , what will we replace them with ?
it is a cap that is unfair , economically , socially and environmentally .
socially : aid is unfairly distributed between country , region and farmer .
eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20 % of farmer .
environmentally : we need a cap which respect the soil , which respect ...
also , mr lyon alone referred to the historical basis .
i will put in a written statement on this issue .
( de ) mr president , i assume you were referring to me .
i would like to pick up on what the previous speaker said .
naturally this is also true beyond the work of the committee .
i beg your indulgence and thank you again for your understanding .
however , i do not wish to prolong the debate .
i therefore feel that we need a realistic budget .
a new strategic importance for food production and the cap : absolutely .
two pillar : absolutely , i agree with that .
they need to meet the challenge of the europe 2020 strategy .
a mr mcguinness say , they may present their contribution in writing .
i totally concur with the need to guarantee security of food supply .
the eu can not promote free trade while protecting it own agricultural market .
above all , the eu need to retain the trust of european farmer .
europe will still need an effective and common agricultural policy after 2013 .
europe ha a particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in the world .
it is therefore vital to ensure that direct payment do not decrease .
these would reduce farmer ' loss arising from price fluctuation .
this is why we must help improve cooperation between farmer .
forward-looking target have been formulated for the entire community .
we thus provide for the possibility of a transitional period .
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community .
farmer should take heart that this parliament understands their concern .
the report is a good basis for further discussion .
in writing . - ( de ) i thank the rapporteur .
our primary goal must be to ensure high-quality food production in europe .
in my opinion , this debate go in the right direction .
the development of rural area play an ever greater role .
however , the european union recently gained 12 new member state .
i believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural policy .
direct payment significantly affect the security of food supply .
i wa one of the author of the first oral question .
i have tried since may to get the mercosur question on the agenda .
i do not know how this happened or why this happened .
can i come back to this in the debate ?
you saw the demand and you saw the problem .
i am going to take 30 second because i have two blank page .
i do not intend to speak before i hear the answer .
i will return at the end of the debate .
i will grant you later the time that you have not used now .
by the same token , ear-tagging rule were not enforced .
indeed , it will have entirely the opposite effect .
europe buy 38 million tonne of soya and feed for cattle .
these import from brazil and argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectare .
these effort will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement .
author . - mr president , i will try and be brief .
there are real concern about the reopening of the negotiation with mercosur .
i represent scotland , which ha extensive beef production .
can someone please tell me what they are being allowed to negotiate on ?
is there no tariff , or are there minimum tariff ?
can someone please tell u what the mandate is ?
finally , what involvement doe the agriculture commissioner have on this issue ?
will this parliament be consulted before any final agreement is reached ?
i would like to hear some answer to these question .
we share a common history and social value with them .
i am thus happy to respond in any format decided by the chair .
it is an increasingly important partner for the eu .
in term of foreign direct investment , mercosur is also a key partner .
the first meeting with mercosur took place last week in buenos aire .
brazil opposed the iran sanction adopted last june by the un security council .
i will try to give additional example in response to your question .
brazil wa the only bric country with which europe had no strategic partnership .
beef import will increase by 70 % , poultry import by 25 % .
commissioner , i would therefore like to voice my concern to you .
the commission must hear this message and this demand .
that is why an impact assessment is absolutely essential .
it will depend on the firmness of our negotiator .
commissioner , i would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard .
european farmer are operating under strict health and safety criterion .
i should like to emphasise one point in particular .
i am actually grateful that the commission ha reopened negotiation .
europe is certainly not closed off to external trade .
what i would criticise , commissioner , is the information policy pursued .
let me offer just one example in this regard .
there is no need to provide an eu framework for this .
the world ha changed over the past 11 year .
without a proper mandate , we can only reach unacceptable agreement .
this parliament imposes high standard of food production on our producer .
we have failed to defend them in the past .
there is no consistency between agriculture and trade policy .
this parliament ha to insist that there will be .
in your response you spoke about forthcoming summit on climate change .
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % of our beef .
will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessment ?
sacrificing agriculture for gain in other area is simply unacceptable .
how is europe going to provide for these people ?
we must end these talk and look after our farmer .
( pl ) negotiation with the mercosur country were suspended in 2004 .
we do not want cloned meat from the mercosur country .
you understood that we feel that the mandate is no longer valid .
how can we negotiate in such a politically unstable area ?
please tell u when you are going to ignore people .
so i think i have done the maximum i could have done .
that is not the reason to change the mandate .
i am ready to discus at length any of the element .
we will insist that we have this meeting a soon a possible .
a for plant health , environmental and other measure ...
but those are not the one that we can impose on other country .
the sensitive agricultural sector must not be handed over in the negotiation .
two commissioner for one report , what an honour !
lady and gentleman , the survival of european fishery is non-negotiable .
i strongly support your call for an increased coherence of our policy .
we need to work together with a global and integrated vision .
consumer want to know more about the seafood they buy .
i will be very honest with you on this point .
for these reason my group will obviously vote in favour of the report .
more than 60 % of all fish consumed in europe today is imported .
the cadec report mention several important instrument that the eu can use .
that is a first step , but it doe not go far enough .
the second instrument is already in place in the united nation .
we have good international agreement , but we also need to implement them .
mr president , the behaviour of member of this house today is disgraceful .
it would not happen in any other parliament in the world .
the best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stock to recover .
another way to enable european fishery to survive would be through better marketing .
i would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation .
however , we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulty .
we were told originally that there would be vote at 12.00 .
this ha moved by five minute every five minute .
i am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.20 .
all you are worried about is voting and going home .
i will finish my speech by thanking you in advance for your vote .
i will get in touch with them about this .
an attack on an mp anywhere amount to an attack on democracy .
he is in intensive care in hospital in mitrovica .
together with this parliament , i wish him a very speedy recovery .
mr president , lady and gentleman , my group opposes this .
( de ) to support measure in the field of safe abortion
( fr ) ... to support measure for safe abortion .
mr president , lady and gentleman , i would reiterate our opposition .
then they could determine the true view of parliament .
unfortunately , the word 'extensive ' ha been used in the translation .
it mean 'in all of the region of europe ' .
there should be agriculture ( 'flächendeckend ' agriculture ) even throughout mountainous region .
we will correct the text and harmonise them with the original .
we were voting on paragraph 44 , a i told you .
you have paragraph 59 on the screen at the moment .
my group is able to vote in favour of recital ae .
lady and gentleman , chair , please listen carefully .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
m eva dudzinska is sitting to the right of me .
she ha spent almost 35 year in the european parliament .
very often , in fact , money is the fuel for terrorist activity .
in this respect it need to be very clear .
this chamber ha made that mistake , but it ha not been alone .
national parliament have done the same thing on both side of the atlantic .
mr president , i supported elmar brok 's report .
this practice must become the priority of european union foreign policy .
secondly , the eu diplomatic service should reflect the character of the union .
this may lead to the establishment of another union institution .
the eeas should build on the value and identity of the european union .
the european union 's diplomatic corp ha already squeezed out the national service .
i think we could just about manage to do better .
we are the fourth-largest military power on the planet and the fifth-largest economy .
for these reason , i can not vote in favour of this report .
mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution .
kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex balkan political puzzle .
the political crisis following the june 2009 parliamentary election is deplorable .
those country also have significant influence in this region .
it state that in 2008 alone , 2.7 million more people were infected .
a policy of sexual and reproductive right will not help africa .
of course , there are new and future task .
these include green growth , renewable energy and combating world hunger .
europe ha a duty to guarantee food security for it citizen .
europe must guarantee a suitable livelihood for rural community .
we must produce and maintain a healthy environment here .
these destructive discrepancy distort competition and the whole european union market .
that is why i introduced a few derogation when i voted .
scrapping the cap would allow efficient farmer to thrive .
reform is not enough - it is time to scrap the cap .
they are needed to guarantee the food supply a well a sustainable development .
the first one is of an environmental , social and qualitative nature .
and finally , we must do much more to promote aquaculture .
the agreement is a significant step forward compared to the previous version .
from that moment on , the issue of reciprocity will become relevant .
europol will be charged with the task of verifying and approving u request .
the new agreement strike a balance between protecting privacy and guaranteeing security .
in the meantime , the fight against terrorism will remain our overriding concern .
while this agreement is satisfactory , certain point could still have been improved .
this measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy .
this new agreement is better than the previous one .
europol is neither a judicial authority nor a data protection authority .
i am therefore voting in favour of the measure proposed in this report .
that is why i chose to vote in favour of the new agreement .
the commission should carry out this task in an assiduous and timely fashion .
the new version is an improvement on the last one .
we rather support a more secure society with broad democratic right and freedom .
combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection .
for u , the top priority wa limiting the transfer of bulk data .
terrorism is a threat and a such must be combated .
the re-hashed swift agreement doe very little to change this situation .
even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied .
this is a commitment which need to be implemented within five year .
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizen ' right .
it is a tool of the nato strategy and war .
my country ha shown it commitment to european crisis management mission .
the european interest of the initial draft ha been retained .
it is not the business of the ep to do so .
in writing . - i welcome the brok report a amended .
there remain element of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretation .
the same thing ha happened with regard to the eu intelligence structure .
what ha parliament managed to win in the negotiation with the high representative ?
a better service could have been possible , though .
in any case , these cost should be within sensible and comprehensible limit .
the resolution also call for an even stronger presence of eulex in kosovo .
in writing . - ( pt ) i voted against this resolution .
it is strange that the currency in this territory is the euro .
i shall vote against this unacceptable and provocative text .
that is why it will need all our support .
this matter is entirely up to the albanian people themselves .
instrument should therefore be introduced to help re-establish security in kyrgyzstan .
nevertheless , i would reiterate my total commitment to the fight against hiv/aids .
it also show that the ppe group is divided on the issue .
almost half of those living with hiv are woman .
school education programme on sexual and reproductive right are crucial for hiv/aids prevention .
for these reason the ecr group ha decided to abstain on this resolution .
this convention need to be applied immediately by all state .
parliament 's support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified .
regrettably , child are the main victim of this type of explosive material .
farmer also provide food , which we need in order to live .
they generate more than eur 337 billion in production annually at eu level .
several amendment have been tabled in the plenary part-session .
in writing . - ( lt ) i voted for this report .
the union now consists of a great number of member state .
first of all , we need simplified arrangement and le red tape .
we have to rethink the general objective of a new common agricultural policy .
european have new expectation in term of food production and supply .
we must maintain market control measure which control price volatility and ensure profitability .
in this context , i believe that maintaining milk quota is vital .
we voted to hold on to the two-pillar structure .
market support measure are recognised a being an important part of the cap .
we have rejected any attempt to renationalise the policy .
i support the structure and approach of the lyon report .
thus , the adoption of this report is highly satisfactory .
it penalises the efficient farmer and prop up the inefficient one .
what the consumer care about is quality and price .
i voted in favour of the report by mr cadec .
the report call for the creation of an ecolabel for fishery product .
having grown rapidly since 2005 , this market is increasingly dependent on import .
european fishery can not survive in the long term with protectionism and subsidy .
the quality of imported fishery product is extremely important in this context .
fishing is important for food , and also ensures a variety of job .
the community strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture wa recently approved .
i agree with the rapporteur on the issue of custom protection .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
therefore , it is necessary to tighten up legislation on identification .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
unfortunately , once again we are forced to address them .
this time it is the case of the human right activist farai maguwu .
ultimately , then , we are also dealing with the kimberley process itself .
after all , all diamond are mined in appalling condition .
to say that the situation in zimbabwe is tragic is unfortunately an understatement .
the last election took place in a climate of fear .
the european union is the main contributor of humanitarian aid to zimbabwe .
it attitude in this matter must therefore be exemplary .
human right are being upheld or they are not .
farai maguwu wa arrested on charge of publishing information prejudicial to the state .
inevitably the wealth from these mine is now bankrolling mugabe 's henchman .
zimbabwe should therefore be refused readmission to the kimberley process .
the eu delegation is monitoring his situation very closely .
he wa arrested for providing information on the kimberley process .
venezuela , in particular the case of maria lourdes afiuni
this is not an isolated case , lady and gentleman .
we have therefore requested that judge afiuni be freed immediately .
thing have not improved since our last resolution ; quite the opposite .
several judge have become victim of such presidential behaviour .
some have been removed from office ; others have left the country .
( e ) president chávez , judge afiuni must be freed immediately .
she wa arrested following this release and placed in detention .
however , we are not holding an urgent debate on prison here .
perhaps not in the form of an emergency resolution .
it will have escaped nobody 's attention that we have election very soon .
how this judge can hope for a fair trial is beyond me .
mr posselt , it is a question of priority .
that is why we have this campaign of vilification .
venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law .
venezuela ha been a land of refuge for many .
we are talking here today about human right and who is breaching them .
the politicisation of the judiciary ha increased since hugo chávez came to power .
judicial authority do not usually dare speak out against the government .
when this doe happen , the consequence are drastic .
that information must be allowed to percolate through to u .
i also wholeheartedly support paragraph 14 of the resolution .
there is a second point i would like to mention .
it is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country , to escape .
that is important when we consider the situation that these people are in .
in the following match they did not do so well .
this is perhaps a country like no other in the world right now .
fortunately in our resolution we recognised that china ha a role to play .
reportedly 80 % of north korean in china end up a trafficking victim .
therefore i will not expand on what other colleague have said .
the question really is , what can we do about it ?
there are 24 million people in north korea who need our assistance .
finally , we should do our best to assist refugee .
unfortunately , thing are not a mr vigenin and mr martin have said .
i come from a country which wa ruled by communism .
even potential victory in football can not mask the reality of the situation .
occasional news leak come out from defector and the reality is truly horrific .
the dream of many north korean is simply to flee their own country .
however , life is better there than in north korea .
how can we help the korean in this situation ?
through an active joint approach by the great power .
the majority of those sent to these camp are no longer released .
these people can not simply be regarded a 'economic migrant ' .
we should not punish them for the sin of their leader .

on monday , hungary experienced the greatest disaster in the country 's history .
we know how important independent journalism is in every society .

action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
we are in favour of this because it is a very complicated topic .
thank you , mr wortmann-kool , for your explanation .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
around 30 % of the member of our parliament are woman .
the young people elected to this parliament are aged between 12 and 17 .
we always wanted there to be a gender balance in the youth parliament .
we have ratified all the main international human right treaty .
with your permission , i will now switch to english .
we are almost half of the planet 's inhabitant .
i have an appeal to the rich and the powerful .
but donor should also make an honest and critical analysis of the policy .
we can all do better , in timor leste and elsewhere .
we have made tremendous progress in the last three year .
our country ha only been independent for eight year .
they are not measurable , but they are equally important .
we have been able to build bridge with the entire region .
we have established diplomatic relation with more than 100 country .
may god , the almighty and the merciful , bless u all .
we would first like to ask for your moral support .
this is a shame , because the debate is very important .
they continue to share a primitive and abominable practice : the death penalty .
the impact of the death penalty in preventing crime is not even proven .
the shelter city programme should become operational a soon a possible .
there are now only 43 country that impose the death penalty .
the eu need to be somewhat more sophisticated in it approach .
justified doubt and shortcoming have been brought to light concerning his trial .
last year , at least 714 people were executed by state .
this excludes china , a it will not provide transparency on the issue .
we should concentrate on addressing those case a well .
the death penalty is therefore a crime in itself .
this requirement is routinely ignored , while europe look the other way .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 october 2010 .
the reality of this situation should give u food for thought .
the death penalty is an irreversible , inhuman punishment that breach human right .
the death penalty ha not been proven to prevent or reduce crime significantly .
it is most regrettable that it is still in use in 43 country .
it can not be regarded a proper justice in any circumstance .
most death sentence are carried out in china , iran and iraq .
there are even more country like this in the world at large .
capital punishment , therefore , cause the opposite effect to the one intended .
therefore , it is important that we act at global level .
the european union ha introduced a ban on the use of capital punishment .
our role is to take care to ensure that our society are safe .
eu action on oil exploration and extraction in europe ( debate )
that ha become evident from the oil well in the gulf of mexico .
there are problem here that are beyond our control .
the question is : would the eu be prepared for such a disaster ?
i imagine that new resource would be needed for this .
i would also like to mention liability for such major event .
what , in fact , is the insurance situation ?
what possibility are there for getting the fund needed ?
there is much we do not know about the high sea .
what kind of working condition and social standard are effective there ?
after all , the human factor can also play a major role .
offshore oil ha it problem ; offshore wind would be better .
we are in the process of finalising a communication .
we are talking about oil , and also about gas .
overall , then , please give u two week .
we are on track to meet the objective of our communication .
that should remain in the back of our mind .
a i mentioned , however , security must take precedence .
i see three area in which we can act here .
a third area is emergency management within the eu .
the environmental liability directive , i recall , doe not cover economic damage .
it took five month for the leak to be stopped for good .
these proposal , of which there are many , are important .
these are all very tangible thing that are set out in this resolution .
we said we would control them , not wipe them out .
madam president , the real significance of the deepwater disaster is being missed .
lady and gentleman , this is no way to go about thing .
i am grateful for being allowed to take the floor .
my committee wa not involved in the resolution at all .
it wa a warning both for the united state and for europe .
there are two very important element a far a i am concerned .
several of my fellow member have spoken about this .
it is not an overreaction ; it is a very calm reaction .
we are at a different stage of development in this area of legislation .
in 32 case , operation of these installation wa halted .
another problem is that these platform have been heavily exploited .
this must also apply to firm which come from outside the european union .
i hope parliament will think twice about going a far a that .
this ha also played a role in the ever-increasing number of accident .
we all know that prevention is the most important thing .
( sl ) the disaster in the gulf of mexico is terrifying .
i would therefore argue that we in the union are in no hurry .
above all , we must also take action outside our own border .
all effort should be geared to increasing the safety of crude oil extraction .
the first inspection have already revealed certain breach of safety norm .
the possession of valid certification is a key requirement .
this ha been mentioned and i agree with it .
madam president , disaster like this should make u think .
i hope that will happen in respect to the arctic area .
maybe we should think quite carefully about what happens in the arctic .
alarm bell are ringing and they can not be ignored .
the limit of the world 's oil reserve are reasonably well known today .
it is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it .
i feel that to do this , three thing are absolutely essential .
thirdly , we must guarantee the highest standard of environmental protection .
let u not be under any illusion , however .
this is even more true at a global level .
indeed , the speech at time revealed very different point of view .
the second point : can a moratorium be justified ?
clearly , it is difficult to answer that question directly .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 october 2010 .
i welcome the view put forward by my colleague , jo leinen .
this deficiency wa made painfully evident by a serious environmental disaster .
to make matter worse , the heavy metal may cause serious air pollution .
however , lesson were learned from piper alpha and regulation were tightened up .
if further lesson emerge from the gulf , appropriate amendment can be made .
τhe next item is the joint debate on the following report :
one of these , quite rightly , is biodiversity .
they are nature 's service provider that keep our ecosystem running .
replacing the service provided by these plant and animal is an expensive business .
i should also like to mention a few figure .
if that doe not astonish you , then here are some more figure .
certain region that have considerable biodiversity are similarly in decline .
there is near universal access to electricity in north africa .
goal 7 of the millennium development goal is to ensure environmental sustainability .
i hope so , at least - we shall see on 14 october .
commissioner , i know that biodiversity is something you hold dear .
that must change , a we lead the world on these issue .
without public awareness and the raising of awareness , nothing will change .
we need a 360 degree awareness of what this mean .
go through facebook to stop biodiversity loss and support this campaign .
is the european union determined to resist the monetisation of living thing ?
the european union will still have a particular responsibility in these negotiation .
that is about the size of the new york stock exchange .
take the collapse of the newfoundland cod fishery in the 1990s .
it ha cost cad 2 billion in replacement cost .
therefore , we must fight to conserve it at the conference in nagoya .
we have overfished , and stock are having a difficult time recovering .
the baltic sea ha a historically high level of pollution .
pregnant woman in sweden were advised not to eat locally caught fish .
however , we must not make unrealistic demand here .
( de ) madam president , let me begin with a detail .
that is always the big challenge at these international conference .
i also believe that money alone is not enough .
many of my fellow member have called for additional funding .
a you know , my pet subject is water .
let u see what shape the proposal take then .
i therefore urgently call on the council to examine this issue in depth .
we therefore hope that good result will come out of the conference .
but what doe the conveniently vague and ambiguous term 'biodiversity ' actually mean ?
let u be frank , you have not got a clue .
madam president , let u put a few fact in order .
people constantly say that the polar bear population ha fallen .
in other word , we reduce the habitat of bird and other animal .
the future common agricultural policy must reconcile biodiversity with agricultural subsidy .
the danube region is among the top 20 ecoregions in the world .
it is home to 2 000 plant specie and 5 000 animal specie .
is this a question of money or of responsibility ?
among other thing , it will have to thoroughly change it sectoral policy .
the use of agricultural variety specific to given region must be promoted .
( de ) madam president , 2010 is the international year of biodiversity .
that is probably the overall issue giving u the greatest headache .
however , there could still be certain preventive instrument .
he also spoke positively about where improvement have been made .
i should start by saying that we should hide nothing .
there are basically two line on which we should and can act .
we have done quite a lot in europe up to now .
i am very cautious when we talk about implementation of natura 2000 .
i think it is extremely important that we understand that .
so we should do our utmost to ensure there is a breakthrough there .
red plus is a much for climate change a for dealing with biodiversity .
this is an important debate which lie ahead of u .
so it is very important that we achieve success there .
all your call for u to speak with one voice are well heard .
but having parliament firmly behind u is really helpful .
there are certain point i should like to discus in rather more detail .
first and foremost , access and benefit sharing ( ab ) .
i should like to thank everyone who ha underlined the importance of this .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 october 2010 .
already today , numerous way of life are under serious threat .
let u take action now and set the course for a species-rich future .
the cost of deforestation is rising to approximately usd 4.5 trillion per year .
homo sapiens produce the most waste of all the biological specie .
this is the basis for the present day decline in biodiversity .
at a certain stage , it will then tip over into another state .
unfortunately , we still behave like a patient suffering from cancer .
this is a priority cross-cutting objective of the belgian presidency .
it is based on a limited number of quantified objective and some guideline .
along with guideline 10 , it constitutes the social pillar of the strategy .
i want to make the belgian presidency a social presidency par excellence .
the eu 2020 growth strategy must be sustainable and inclusive .
we would genuinely urge the commission to be dynamic on this matter .
without a social dimension , the european project is doomed to failure .
the commission is in the process of updating the frequently asked question document .
it is always important that we live up to citizen ' expectation .
we need a mechanism which will drive the change which everybody recognises .
i have met dozen of them in the past six month .
i think it is most important that parliament is involved in that process .
also , in the council , the anti-discrimination directive is still blocked .
they were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis .
the banksters are carrying on a if nothing had happened .
pension and wage are to be cut , consumption tax perhaps increased .
contribution to social health insurance are rising while service decline .
this need to be clearly laid down in primary law .
human dignity can not be ensured without minimum social standard .
i believe that this need to change a soon a possible .
that is the primary objective of a social market economy .
social progress is a lever for ending the crisis .
where is the defence and promotion of public service ?
( de ) mr president , the political goal are clear .
most of the instrument are to be found at the member state level .
we should therefore broaden out monetary union into an economic and social union .
i sometimes wonder if we speak to the same people .
free and fair competition wa supposed to lower price .
fiscal consolidation is inevitable because country accumulated high debt .
even in these difficult time , we are calling for social awareness .
that is where the european year ha been helping u a lot .
of course , nobody belief that this can be delivered overnight .
i would be doubtful about establishing a new fund .
nobody is calling for the privatisation of social service .
the fight against poverty really must not be forgotten today .
the treaty of lisbon reinforces europe 's social policy dimension .
it seems to me that this is not merely a diplomatic gift .
i congratulate them for the effort made and the important result achieved .
a i say , i am quoting from an english translation .
we are talking about ordinary people from the balkan .
we are not talking about safeguarding job or the right of residence .
the only reservation i have over the report concern kosovo .
therefore , i have no worry on our parliament 's score .
that is important for young people , for business people and for everyone .
what i am worried about , however , is the council of minister .
there are rumour that some country are having doubt .
we would be seen to be applying double standard .
that the council doe not trust the commission 's opinion .
we hope that such opportunity will really be exploited .
there need to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen .
we in the eu should also work towards this goal .
this is an extremely sensitive situation for the entire european union .
oppression of woman is good , drinking alcohol is bad .
it is enough to drive you round the bend .
you are making an assumption that you can not substantiate are you not ?
that is all i can say on that score .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur , tanja fajon .
now , finally , the door will open for them to get out .
the reform are important for those country but also for the eu .
the last thing we want is a black hole in europe .
we promised the country visa liberalisation when they fulfilled the criterion .
it is a fact ; it is the reality .
nobody in europe should feel isolated and excluded without an opportunity to travel .
kosovo also need to be included in the visa liberalisation regime .
the visa waiver ha been based on road map adapted for each country .
the assessment also take into account the implication for regional coherence and reciprocity .
it is hoped that this process will be completed very soon .
yet the eu also need to keep up it credibility and commitment .
i can reassure you once again that the benchmark have been met .
kosovo is , of course , also a very important partner in this .
the people of albania and bosnia and herzegovina are expecting that from u .
i think that is the message they will be waiting to hear tomorrow .
the right to visa-free movement will help achieve this .
a stop must be put to the negotiation at long last .
the aim should instead be to establish a privileged partnership .
furthermore , we still do not have a definition of liquidity .
from our point of view , there are five unresolved issue .
it ha taught u some lesson , which we must take on board .
the global prudential rule were not suited to real-life condition .
in my view , this agreement is good news .
that will give them enough time to conform to these new provision .
it is a reasonable starting position for u to take .
why doe europe have to be the cry-baby of basel ?
this is not what we intended with the supervisory architecture .
it is not what is intended by basel iii .
and if that mean more stringent rule , then so be it .
it is time to realise , therefore , that the party is over .
we can not continue to have the taxpayer bailing out bank .
mortgage bond are used for long-term financing and investment in the wider economy .
we should take a more differentiated approach to the factor of debt leverage .
i would like to congratulate mr karas very warmly .
it seems to me that this ha been lacking hitherto .
the measure proposed in this area should be welcomed .
the crisis ha demonstrated that some thing can happen extremely quickly .
rule and new law are not always the answer .
let u not settle for good if we can achieve the best .
i believe that rigidity and bureaucracy are always lying in wait .
the u economy is mainly financed through the capital market .
then we would be scoring goal and not conceding own goal .
a few moment ago , mr ludvigsson spoke about stress test .
mr ford , we do indeed need to protect taxpayer .
mr klinz raised the issue of 'too big to fail ' .
mr nitras , a regard complex financial instrument , we need stronger supervision .
i am going to prepare a consultation aimed at strengthening this regulation .
we need the definition of liquidity before we get the draft directive .
let u involve the national parliament in this communication process .
the submitted report is drafted in relatively precise term .
basel ii ha not proved very effective a a crisis prevention mechanism .
the question is , how much are we willing to pay for it ?
in this regard , it is particularly important to secure financing for smes .
difference must be taken into account without penalising certain business model .
otherwise , there is a risk of harming the european economy .
the next item is the commission statement on commission fine in antitrust case .
on it behalf , therefore , i am delighted to make this presentation .
the version currently in force wa adopted just four year ago .
this save a great deal of time and resource for all party .
fine , therefore , honourable member , are our primary tool .
a number of member state actually authorise such sanction .
is there a need for a formal legal framework ?
our fine are set at a level that fairly punishes past unlawful behaviour .
dare i say , there may be some doubt about this .
a weak , inadequate response will be an incentive and stimulus for infringement .
that is the best guarantee that they will not face excessive fine .
and so the answer wa that it had not been considered .
however , i would like to draw your attention to two matter .
i think that we should not become fixated on these figure .
we may have to be inventive about what we do .
what if the commission wa to think about adopting different approach ?
i want to welcome what colleague have said this evening .
firstly , what can we do better in term of prevention ?
thirdly , can we have a timescale for the prospective proposal ?
i would say that we should also have a fine : do both .
he is satisfied with the way that these guideline are working .
the commission is bound by these guideline on the method of setting fine .
we have an administrative system for ensuring the proper implementation of competition rule .
what is more , this system ha many advantage .
we also have the case-law of the court which support this system .
we can raise this issue through the compliance programme .
i welcome the swift response from the european executive .
the commission play the dual role of prosecutor and judge .
this mean that people who have not broken the law become collateral victim .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
this is something we have to see replicated across the european union .
europe 's reunification started with the reunification of the german nation .
the fall-out from the financial crisis is still very much evident in iceland .
dealing with them is a joint challenge and requires joint action .
the class struggle will not be stopped by reactionary resolution and law .
( lt ) the eu-china summit is taking place today in brussels .
the ninth round of dialogue took place last november .
i am referring to an absurd institution called the national audiovisual council .
let me say that again : over 50 % .
the champalimaud foundation inaugurated a centre for research into cancer and the neuroscience .
the champalimaud foundation will attract world-renowned scientist to portugal and europe .
health care system in sub-saharan africa and global health ( short presentation )
madam president , commissioner , thank you for having stayed this far .
there are woman 's mutuals , café owner 's mutuals and so on .
it is that set of problem to which the report refers .
the level of health care in sub-saharan africa is deplorable .
the health of the local inhabitant can only suffer a a result .
we shall be returning to this subject in due course .
they are our reference point when intervening in matter of health .
there is no single , perfect solution to fit all local circumstance .
we apologise for the slight delay caused by the traffic .
i would recommend that everyone walk to parliament for three reason .
and the commission statement on the future of the european social fund .
it must not merely be a financial tool for investment .
it is a policy that generates new resource , adding to growth potential .
our new europe 2020 strategy set out common objective for the entire union .
i look forward to the contribution of this house to that debate .
european citizen expect to see eu-level fund focused on result and achievement .
access to the fund should be simpler and also more user-friendly .
these new , difficult , time call for a new policy .
objective 2 must be retained , because it is very clear .
the regional development fund and the social fund should continue to operate together .
finally , allow me to add that we must improve thing .
that is attainable and would lead to better result .
my group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle .
the european social fund is a very effective tool in this regard .
no region in the european union is shoved to one side .
that also mean that we will finally get away from one-sided development .
this make it clear that there are three side to regional development .
one key interest is economic , social and territorial cohesion .
personally , i am convinced that existing resource are more or le sufficient .
the second key question is what we should finance from the european fund .
therefore , european fund should be geared towards investment , and not consumption .
therefore , the only rational criterion is the level of gdp .
this text is responsible , concrete and open door to the future .
today , employment must have our full attention and must be our priority .
commissioner , can you assure u that the esf will meet these expectation ?
research and development is certainly very important for galileo and others .
by that , i mean both the basic principle and the sum allocated .
what is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policy ?
however , regional development issue are not confined to increasing gross domestic product .
we all know that this ha not been the case .
therefore , gdp must remain the reliable indicator for regional policy .
that give an indication of the priority in the treaty .
given that context , this issue really need to be dealt with .
perhaps we can begin to get it right this time .
the threshold of 75 % of gdp will naturally be renewed in 2014 .
we should therefore take a long-term view of european cohesion policy .
i would like to focus on the promotion of europe 's diversity .
investment , not spending , should be the goal , pre- and post-2013 .
we must ensure stable and sustainable economic growth and job creation .
we are talking about small project and more flexible adjustment .
is there not an absurdity , a paradox in your economic policy ?
that level of joined up and targeted thinking can only bring greater reward .
this is , and must remain , the pillar of european integration .
the current cohesion policy requires improvement , without any major amendment .
above all , we must reject and refuse to renationalise and underfund it .
mr president , the resolution is strategically very well written .
however , we have to find where the problem are at present .
17 member state are at le than 18 % .
also , 60 % of member state have a lower absorption than this .
for some of them , the figure is three time le .
( de ) mr president , we are not talking about peanut here .
however , i am opposed to a separate legal framework for the esf .
however , there are different idea for the post-2013 cohesion policy .
i would like to say a few word about cohesion policy .
regional flight in the bmw region are an economic and social necessity .
eu support for cross-border cooperation in ireland must be retained .
we want outermost town and region to receive special attention .
the first is to make sure there is a second chance .
city are an important driving force behind development in europe .
this is why i have a particular question for mr hahn .
what opportunity do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension ?
if so , what percentage were you thinking of ?
this is why it is part of the eu 2020 strategy .
let u give thought to how to improve and strengthen it .
that is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risk .
we expect the commission to take action along these line .
unemployment rate across the european union have shot up .
another negative phenomenon is unemployment among young people in the eu .
europe is thus going through a period of transformation and face huge challenge .
the europe 2020 strategy is showing u which way to go .
i believe the european social fund need specific and simple rule .
i believe that simplification and greater control should be tightly linked .
mr president , joined-up policy are essential to achieving result .
it would be a grave mistake to split up this cohesion policy .
it would be the equivalent of breaking up the european union .
mr president , wale ha benefited hugely from structural funding .
i also look forward to discussing the definition of an urban area .
that is a very important issue for u to discus .
that is not the way to build the future .
we are also going to continue with this objective until 2020 .
accelerated economic growth doe not always translate into a reduction in poverty .
( ga ) i do not have much time , mr president .
therefore , i will focus on just a few point .
some actually had to hire an expert to do the application for them .
it should certainly be the main criterion , but not the only one .
it therefore need to be closely coordinated with the regional development fund .
we have to take account of the positive experience of the region .
today , one third of european do not have vocational qualification .
mr president , we are talking about cohesion and regional policy .
so there are link between all of our policy .
in each of them , we want an adequately funded policy framework .
i have a few point in relation to the resolution .
their voice must be not just heard but listened to and responded to .
the european social fund is not a tool for implementing such idea .
i am interceding in order to ensure that it is not forgotten .
however , the research and transport infrastructure are also important concern .
the special circumstance of the outermost region must not be forgotten .
mr president , this ha been a very lively and committed debate .
we very much support the call for a simplification of the rule .
we have to avoid these trajectory and identify the issue requiring further action .
europe need to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of it region .
at the moment , the road and rail link do not meet expectation .
we need to emphasise that this fund should have it own rule .
their role in the success of the eu 2020 strategy is crucial .
therefore , public sector lay-offs threaten woman in the first instance .
the cohesion policy is vital to the european integration process .
the cohesion policy ha it supporter , but also it critic .
i trust that the commission will come forward with good proposal .
i am grateful to mr hübner for her responsible work .
all the issue included in the resolution are of current concern to latvia .
by contrast , poland , for example , consists of 16 region .
i am prepared to play an active part in such a review .
finally , territorial cooperation deserves particular attention in the next cohesion policy .

welcome to the european parliament , 20 year later .
the european institution played a very important role in german reunification .
there would be no reunification of europe without the reunification of germany .
( the house accorded the speaker a standing ovation )
it wa a time of oppressive silence and paralysis .
his faith and his word alone unsettled the intolerant regime .
anyone who called communism into question wa doing so on behalf of everyone .
we german have a great deal to thank the polish people for .
the closed brandenburg gate stood a a symbol of separation .
they permeate and define all aspect of our life .
all area of society were subjected to fundamental change .
it finally opened a door to unity for the german .
he wa a true friend to the people of germany .
through democratic election , they succeeded in bringing about fundamental change .
however , reunification did not just create the germany that we know today .
it requires and encourages a sense of responsibility among all citizen .
however , participation doe not mean that everyone is given something .
instead it mean that everyone can contribute something and need to participate .
they also make too little effort to expand their achievement .
we should be prepared to defend these right and freedom .
the defence of freedom lie at the heart of europe .
it ha also made the freedom of the whole of europe complete .
history is not a mysterious destiny that is visited on people .
now we have our second honoured speaker , jacques delors .
later , he wa also a minister of economy and finance .
he had two term in office a president of the european commission .
at the time , it wa not possible to say more .
the european parliament wa also very active and attentive during this time .
it belongs within the community , if that is what it want . '
this wa met with great presence of mind , understanding and generosity .
the second wa economic and social , and equally difficult to meet .
many people in europe perhaps tend to forget this .
( the house accorded the speaker a standing ovation )
thank you very much for your speech today a well .
conference on biological diversity - nagoya 2010 ( vote )
( fr ) mr president , i will be very brief .
( fr ) mr president , i am outraged by those statement .
mr gollnisch , i am a very nice and patient man .
therefore , we voted for the original text but not for the amendment .
in fact , you called out to vote on the original paragraph .
on the screen , we then saw that we voted on amendment 1 .
if amendment 1 is adopted , the original paragraph fall .
i will go back to amendment 1 by roll-call vote .
basel ii and revision of the capital requirement directive ( crd 4 ) (
health care system in sub-saharan africa and global health (
eu cohesion and regional policy after 2013 ( vote )
why were the control in place so obviously inadequate ?
mr president , i wa pleased to vote in favour of this proposal .
that wa done pending a review , but that review is most bizarre .
this murder allegation is based on court document which do not stand up .
during the first quarter of 2010 , 1 244 woman were raped .
it is now high time that we all opened our eye .
let u never turn our back on africa 's woman and child again .
i would like to mention something of which i have personal knowledge .
these are the reason why i wa unable to vote for the report .
there is an urgent need to prevent such situation .
in that sense , it represents a step forward .
people living illegally also have the right to be protected .
that is why it is so important to adopt this directive .
regrettably , denmark is not participating in the coordination arrangement for third-country national .
given the high rate of unemployment , this situation is worrying and incomprehensible .
altogether , several hundred more worker have been made redundant .
however , the little which is being given may relieve their hardship .
it sanction the appetite for profit of socially irresponsible billionaire like manuel jove .
the same applies to this case a to the previous danish case .
the commission proposes to mobilise an amount of eur 1 844 700 .
however , the fund still ha to prove it worth .
the main drawback is the necessary mobilisation of the fund .
on average it take 294 day to approve application .
the european globalisation adjustment fund is one such mechanism .
i am abstaining out of consideration for the danish worker ill-treated by globalisation .
however , the little which is being given may ease their hardship .
all the argument set forth in the report justify this decision .
i would like to congratulate mr mathieu on this report .
these are a few of the argument explaining how i voted .
this measure is primarily intended to create a link between nation .
the only region not included in the visa liberalisation process is kosovo .
in light of the above consideration , i voted against the fajon report .
the council should now move swiftly to approve their inclusion .
moreover , eu support will certainly help to broaden people 's horizon .
i am voting for the document for the reason given above .
independent investigation must be carried out to bring the guilty to justice .
civilian continue to suffer unbearably and live in poverty .
each of them is going through their own tragedy .
i therefore voted in favour of adopting this resolution .
the joint motion for a resolution expressly support and welcome these training mission .
i fully support this resolution of the european parliament .
we must identify the name of the responsible un commander .
all we can do is describe them , one by one .
all this took place in the vicinity of a un camp .
according to internal estimate , about 6 million people have died so far .
china alone executed more people than all the other country put together .
this made me decide to vote in favour of it adoption .
it is therefore europe 's duty to prioritise this legitimate fight .
more than 330 000 people in latvia remain without status .
the death penalty is the most inhuman and savage punishment .
i voted for this report a it deal with an extremely important subject .
that is the only real political issue of today 's vote .
biodiversity issue must be taken into account when farming practice are being implemented .
in writing . - ( lt ) i agree with this resolution .
adequate financing will unavoidably be required to implement the planned action and strategy .
it is likely that public sector support will be insufficient .
it is particularly important to strengthen diplomatic effort with third country .
i agree that biodiversity conservation issue are raised only intermittently in public debate .
the united nation ha declared 2010 the international year of biodiversity .
the rate of loss is projected to accelerate tenfold by 2050 .
the rampant rate of man-made biodiversity loss is worrying .
therefore , the european union considers this problem to be extremely urgent .
at present , one in five specie is at risk of extinction .
what should we expect at nagoya between 18 and 29 october 2010 ?
at best , that the european union speaks with one voice .
biodiversity affect the life of every one of u .
however , i would like to concentrate on one specific issue .
certainly , one can agree that industrial agriculture is not environmentally friendly .
we have been seeing an intensification of this process recently .
the protection of biodiversity is essential to achieving the millennium development goal .
investment in the preservation of biodiversity will pay dividend .
it is pressing the european commission to take step towards greater harmonisation .
i therefore voted strongly in favour of this resolution .
moreover , global standard on liquidity management are proposed .
last but not least , it proposes global liquidity management standard .
i voted in favour of this resolution a i believe that :
high quality liquidity standard are a key part of the crisis response ;
it is necessary to define the criterion for high quality liquid asset ;
a commission legislative proposal is scheduled during the first quarter of 2011 .
in writing . - i wish to confirm my support for this report .
in writing . - this report deal with a number of issue .
nevertheless , of great concern is paragraph 6 which deal with abortion .
this is why i have decided to vote against the report a amended .
this is why i support the adoption of mr de keyser 's report .
we therefore chose to vote in favour of the report .
those who have health care are the people who can afford it .
the main cause are haemorrhaging , infection and hypertensive crisis .
it is a disgrace to u in the developed world .
aid targeted at making health care accessible is needed .
we firmly believe that outermost town and region should receive special attention .
i absolutely agree that cohesion policy should not be renationalised .
in writing . - ( lt ) i supported this resolution .
this is one of the local level initiative that europe must promote .
regional flight to the bmw region are an economic and social necessity .
for all these reason , i shall vote in favour of the report .
we need to pay more attention to peripheral rural region .
cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity between european region .
cohesion policy is the great pillar of european solidarity .
in writing . - ( lt ) i agree with this resolution .
a sustainable economic growth and job creation policy in europe is essential .
however , support from the structural fund alone is insufficient .
the european social fund 's role could , however , be strengthened further .
the resolution adopted today by parliament highlight some of these measure .
we need much more than esf fund , however .
this money wa used mostly to tackle long-term and youth unemployment .
this programme ha a total budget of eur 1.36 billion .
this report claim to defend decent work and to fight against precarious work .
the european social fund ha to pay for this negligent state of affair .

the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the institution have shown that they can deal with challenge .
we made quick decision - some perhaps were made too quickly .
that will present u with major challenge in the long term .
the joint rivellini-gräßle report attempt to address these problem .
what remains is the important homework that the service need to do .
no efficiency saving a a result of the merger are in sight .
i wish it the success that we need for europe in the world .
i am grateful to everybody for the work that ha been accomplished .
to that extent , then , we can be very satisfied .
there is one issue that should not be underestimated .
i have just said that we did not succeed in doing this .
i will make an official statement on this matter .
let me highlight just a couple of the core element of the proposal .
national diplomat will be able to apply for published vacant post .
the negotiation on this file have not always been easy .
i therefore hope that the european parliament will adopt these amendment tomorrow .
that is why tomorrow , parliament will be amending the council regulation .
it is proof that we can deliver under the lisbon treaty .
in any case , i wish her every success in this mission .
'strong ' mean subject to democratic and parliamentary scrutiny and control .
half a year ago , geographical balance wa not an issue .
this also applies to the foreign service of the union .
this wa the most important objective of the committee on development 's work .
therefore , i would like to give special emphasis to this issue .
it is very important to establish appropriate organisational and operational regulation .
the committee on budget will control this on an annual basis .
that is necessary , and i take the promise seriously .
we will certainly press for these thing to be implemented .
with the united state , we need to negotiate on equal term .
the european parliament ha a fine motto : united in diversity .
these are word that carry obligation and they have a deep meaning .
i wholeheartedly wish baroness ashton success in this important work .
we have saved the community method and development priority .
we have enhanced democratic scrutiny , especially on cfsp line .
what is the added value of the european external action service ?
first of all , it will require effective coordination across policy area .
i still want to see the structure in place to achieve that .
second , we have to enhance crisis management and conflict prevention .
that can be an added value provided by the european union .
along these line , do we need more deputy ambassador ?
the role of former diplomat belongs in the 19th century .
the discharge of the council remains on our agenda .
this lead me to the proportion of woman represented .
however , what would he have been without a big band ?
the government did not do this ; we did their job for them .
i believe most of u can agree on these principle .
the devil is , however , in the detail .
nevertheless , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur .
finally , member state are making deep cut in public spending .
at the moment , i see two basic problem associated with this process .
we have had many debate and we have achieved a great deal .
i believe that the prerequisite for a successful eeas are in place .
in other word , the european parliament is almost happy .
then we would have european added value right from the start .
we wish the european external action service ( eeas ) every success .
we need a strong european union of all 27 member state .
it ha proved possible , and parliament ha been part of it .
we are very proud that we have been actively involved .
let u say this frankly - the examination result is partially good .
i wish you , of course , every success in you work .
that is what we want to see from 1 december onwards .
( sk ) the european external action service is gradually developing it role .
today , we are debating the funding for it activity .
for that reason , these were not the most difficult of negotiation .
then all of your concern should , in fact , be dispelled .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 20 october at 12:30 .
it is in our common interest to make the eeas operational in 2011 .
however , this support doe not equate to giving carte blanche .
it is not a good idea to widen them .
the next item is the joint debate on the subject of poverty :
eradicating poverty is the most pressing global challenge of our time .
where are we now , five year before the 2015 deadline ?
to achieve this , we need to ass progress on this every year .
development aid must be conceived a a catalyst , not a a cure .
no country ha ever been transformed by aid alone .
in the end , this is what the principle of 'ownership ' mean .
this is enshrined in the charter of fundamental right of the european union .
the recent economic crisis ha resulted in a rise in unemployment .
unfortunately , it is once again woman who have been hit hardest .
that is why poverty reduction feature in the treaty of lisbon .
they are doing so out of mistaken , short-sighted self-interest .
that is why i urge you to reject amendment 1 and 2 .
the lisbon strategy ha failed in it mission to eradicate poverty .
we can no longer stand by idly and let thing happen .
now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric .
the time ha come to be bold and show some political courage .
poverty , end poverty , this should not be just a slogan .
this is a scandal of the financial community in international development .
those eur 880 billion should be creating wealth in the developing country .
however , hundred of thousand of people have already done that before u .
one of your answer is to introduce a minimum income .
however , a minimum wage only make sense when combined with additional measure .
that would set the inflationary spiral in motion once again .
the focus must therefore be on relief in relation to work .
it ha the biggest gap between living standard in the world .
there are too many people living below the poverty line in rural area .
many of our aid policy for combating poverty are urban policy .
we must also help the rural community combat poverty .
and so i urge you , the fight against poverty ...
thirdly , our approach to combating poverty must be both international and outward-looking .
we must take a legislative initiative on minimum income and organise the financing ...
today , there are more poor people in the european union .
we have a serious problem requiring concrete and effective measure .
80 million european are living on or below the poverty line .
the data on child poverty in my country are devastating .
poverty is increasing , including among european who do have job .
the resolution which we are to adopt is heading in precisely that direction .
this is why europe must continue it effort to achieve them .
those most at risk are single parent , child and older people .
wa i on their side , or on the side of the banker ?
first of all , good word and good intention are not enough .
more job , that is , with right and fair wage .
the eu 2020 strategy also go in this direction .
a conference on child poverty wa organised in september .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 20 october at 12:30 .
in 2009 , europe felt the full brunt of the global economic crisis .
every six second , a child dy of hunger on earth .
the economic crisis ha intensified the problem of poverty in recent year .
it is the only way of giving back dignity to everyone .
above all , member state must face up to their responsibility .
in this regard , poverty still ha a feminine face in europe .
they work le , a household work is not acknowledged a legitimate work .
when comparing wage , manager and executive should be considered separately .
the minimum income , however , varies by nearly 50 % .
despite these shortcoming , this report is certainly informative .
inactivity is much more destructive than many of u would think or know .
however , this is what people living with disability experience day after day .
it is activity that must be increased and encouraged at any cost .
in addition , gerontology and lifestyle research should be supported .
this , too , is a self-perpetuating stigma , which is untenable .
it is very difficult for someone finishing education to find a job .
i am therefore appealing to the representative of the eu .
poverty and social exclusion violate human dignity and fundamental human right .
it is vital to ensure universal access to high quality public service .
in poland , that is about 6.5 million people .
it is enough to lose your job or become seriously ill .
we need , here , effective psychological care and speed in giving help .
formal sitting - address by ban ki-moon , secretary-general of the united nation
last sunday wa international day for the eradication of poverty .
we are awaiting a binding agreement and some crucial decision and practical step .
you will address our parliament and our citizen in a few minute .
the european parliament ha always been the driving force behind ambitious european policy .
this is how we understand the aspiration of our citizen .
but dignity not only mean freedom from hunger , illness and violence .
dignity is also the freedom of belief and respect for difference .
mr secretary-general , we believe that you share those aspiration with u .
we are looking forward to listening to your speech .
you are the vital link between the global , regional and local level .
the united nation and the european union are natural partner .
but something else is happening - a light bulb moment around the world .
no nation , no group , no region can do it alone .
if we share in the burden , we will share in the benefit .
these are testing time , even in a prosperous region like europe .
let me be specific . first , the poverty challenge .
nearly one billion people go to bed hungry every night .
at the recent mdg summit meeting , that is precisely what we agreed .
we can tighten belt without closing our eye to common challenge .
we must focus on employment-centred growth - decent work .
investment in clean and renewable energy is crucial for jumpstarting job and innovation .
where people go hungry , we must help people to help themselves .
this is the most stubborn of the millennium development goal .
we can save the life of more than 16 million woman and child .
here , too , europe 's vision and voice have been central .
we have seen raging fire in russia and epic flood in pakistan .
neither should we avert our eye from what is plain to see .
the health , security and prosperity of million of people depend on it .
most immediately , finance is crucial for building trust and spurring action .
we have also to generate usd 100 billion annually by 2020 .
this wa a promise by the developed world made in copenhagen .
climate change is a crucial part of the broader agenda on sustainable development .
europe ha been a historic engine of growth and change .
you can keep u moving in the right direction .
today , there is new momentum in fulfilling disarmament commitment .
almost seven year ago , my predecessor kofi annan stood before you .
a dangerous trend is emerging - a new politics of polarisation .
they seek to invoke liberal value for illiberal cause .
europe 's darkest chapter have been written in language such a this .
today , the primary target are immigrant of the muslim faith .
europe can not afford stereotyping that close mind and breed hatred .
the world can not afford a europe that doe this .
( parliament accorded the speaker a standing ovation ) .
i am quite sure we will keep the train on the track .
we say we are united in diversity , so let u cooperate .

( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
that is what i would like to highlight in this agreement .
i am therefore very pleased that we have reached this agreement .
in short , we need to continue to work for real equality .
we must remind the member state to transpose directive 2006/54/ec without further delay .
the uncertainty on the labour market affect woman in general .
( sk ) i supported the report , although with certain reservation .
economic freedom is one of the characteristic of the common market .
this data is currently collected on a voluntary basis by 18 member state .
parliament should seize this new prerogative provided for in the treaty of lisbon .
the collection of data will not impose any additional burden on respondent .
currently , 18 member state voluntarily collect that data .
such data are essential not only for statistical purpose .
these data are currently collected on a voluntary basis by 18 member state .
the greens/efa have voted in favour of the proposal .
furthermore , our coastal tourism sector also ha great growth potential .
currently , there are 180 000 unemployed people in latvia .
the application fulfils the eligibility criterion set up by the egf regulation .
in 2010 , another 500 worker are expected to be made redundant .
i would like to express my solidarity with them and their family here .
this meagre support for the unemployed is only being given now , belatedly .
a sum of eur 832 000 wa mobilised on that occasion .
the application fulfils the eligibility criterion set up by the egf regulation .
the application fulfils the eligibility criterion set up by the egf regulation .
i would first like to offer my compliment to the rapporteur .
the aim of the proposal is to bring union legislation up to date .
the very existence of the fishing community depends upon these condition .
we should all be involved in this effort and develop it further .
no one must have exclusive right to exploit atlantic fish resource .
it is also important to prevent the cost becoming excessive .
the most important positive proposal in the report are a follows :
woman hold precarious job much more often than men .
it is necessary to ensure gender equality and social right in the workplace .
in this respect , mr thomsen 's initiative is very timely .
continuing to support imported poverty is not the solution .
it only increase the social problem and may permanently jeopardise social peace .
to reinforce this development is the wrong way to go .
i find all that discriminatory towards our female worker .
i voted in favour of the report by mr thomsen .
this will result in a sharp deterioration in the level of working condition .
there is a large gender divide among these worker : woman are over-represented .
the economic crisis ha contributed to destabilisation of the labour market .
the situation is particularly difficult for graduate , older people and woman .
the crisis ha exacerbated the gender inequality that already exist in employment .
woman working in precarious employment should also have the option of unionised protection .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the year 2011 is an exceptional budgetary year , for several reason .
unfortunately , none of these new role is accompanied by appropriate financial mean .
this , then , is what 2011 is like .
neither the council nor the european parliament now have two reading .
i repeat : we no longer have two reading .
apparently , they are to be financed from current resource .
it is here that , a the european parliament , we have doubt .
the same concern programme related to research and innovation .
we have always fought for this a committed european parliamentarian .
i think it is excessive at this point in time .
we all know that the european union is underfinanced .
the fund required to perform task should be increased .
in our view , it will be impossible to function like this .
we also welcome the amendment by parliamentary committee in this respect .
we should therefore look for compromise in the coming conciliation process .
i heard the end of the commissioner 's speech .
i have also been briefed on the rapporteur 's speech .
obviously , this call for strict control over expenditure .
i would now like to draw your attention more specifically to certain point .
the commission made proposal that were broadly accepted by the council .
the commission will emphasise these in it communication on the budget review .
it will obviously not behave otherwise in the context of this discussion .
it will listen to the proposal and will form an opinion .
mr president , honourable member , i thank you for your attention .
two area which are particularly important are external action and structural fund .
we are therefore of the opinion that the old figure must be reinstated .
the council have used creative accounting to find eur 420 million .
i hope the commission is right in it optimism on dairy market .
we want to get more adult into eu-funded further training .
we would appreciate the council 's support for this .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for finding a balanced position .
we must not forget that the european union budget objective are different .
eu budget money is directed to our future investment .
i call on my colleague to approve the draft budget .
indeed , why legislate without having upstream criterion or downstream operational implementation instrument ?
to just continue with two existing preparatory action is not enough .
the council take away eur 4 billion and invokes the economic crisis .
mr president , minister , it is not worth it .
member state should not play with two contradictory solution .
that is where the biggest cut are being made .
in any case , we will find out , mr rübig .
that is something that we should not forget either .
it must not be allowed to supersede everything else .
so , should we not rein in the eu budget ?
we need to review the financial perspective up to 2013 .
we did not want eur 300 million for a dairy fund .
we should also help to sort out the accounting clearance problem .
in any case , an excellent job ha been done - thank you .
i think we should be careful not to miss the point here .
i believe that that amendment will be rejected tomorrow .
iter 's budget ha been reduced by 45 million .
this is the point from which i would like to begin .
in this debate , too , we need more european solidarity .
mr president , i would like to be completely frank in this debate .
the real rationale at stake is , however , this one .
portugal and italy will also see strike next month .
you can not take this seriously any more ; yet it is happening .
this house seems not to realise what really preoccupies the citizen back home .
yet make no mistake : the pvv no longer stand alone in europe .
therefore , we shall be voting against the 2011 budget .
we believe that is too quick , too soon and too much .
when extra spending is justified , we should support it .
where spending is unnecessary , we should oppose it .
we welcome some of the amendment that have been approved .
firstly , we must make our new power work .
but there is a fundamental misunderstanding in this concept .
the eu budget is small compared to national one - and rightfully so .
it doe not need to grow in order to perform it function .
it should focus only on investment in the common european future .
it never substitute the national budget representing national sovereignty .
the ecr say no to bond issuance a well .
we have enough debt at the national level and even more unfunded liability .
this is also the message pervading the growing struggle throughout europe .
the principle of member state financing the european union is thus under fire .
i would like to comment on three point in particular .
they support the eu strategy for economic recovery and the eu 2020 strategy .
we understand , minister , the position of government .
the european parliament ha lent it support to these policy .
would it be responsible to refuse to develop this system further ?
we must not forget that there are limit to increased efficiency .
a reduction in resource mean a reduction in political ambition .
how can these objective be achieved with the budget being reduced ?
a direct connection can not be made between european and national budget .
these are issue on which we want clarification in the month ahead .
this will be a matter for both turkish cypriot and greek cypriot .
this is yet another missed opportunity for parliament and the european union .
that is something that we will also have to work on .
i have a final and very important comment to make to the council .
you are complaining that we have made reduction in connection with iter .
they prefer to work for themselves , without caring about their neighbour .
however , for now , they are in a minority .
that is why the council 's cut in regional development are completely untenable .
in my opinion , we must try to take the following action .
the council , too , ha already complained about this .
where then is our joint monitoring and where is our joint budgetary control ?
a far a the council is concerned , that is not working out .
we have once again created a reserve for this .
the commission ha 100 official director-general post - 100 since the summer .
however , the greatest disagreement concern the figure , of course .
this is the first budget following the treaty of lisbon .
everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible .
negotiation on the 2011 budget are being conducted at a particularly difficult time .
commitment are an expression of the level of the eu 's political ambition .
the council ha so far failed to take a position on this budget .
i am not saying that to put the blame on you alone .
a money term cut or a freeze would probably be more appropriate .
the united kingdom ha had a double dose of the bitter pill .
these are bill to be paid , a sort of legal obligation .
that mean that 94 % is delivered to the beneficiary .
that should be known when discussing the future of the european budget .
the scope for additional or other kind of majority is virtually non-existent .
the other element linked to the budget will be subject to debate .
we are going to have a discussion on the budget review .
we understand , too , the council 's doubt .
it is worth taking advantage of the opportunity it represents .
i would like to add a political message , if i may .
it wa not by accident that we spent five year together .
however , we are dealing with parliament 's position today .
the effectiveness of the european union is completely dependent on it budget .
however , it can not be separated from the political goal .
we need consensus ; we need unanimity on the next financial perspective .
it took one year to mobilise money for the food aid facility .
we are slowest internally , and quicker in rapid reaction to external challenge .
the lesson therefore is that we need more flexibility .
it could become collateral for loan beyond the balance of payment facility .
it can act a a toolbox for reinforcing the stability and growth pact .
let u take research and infrastructure a an example .
own resource is what make most sense at the end of the day .
( i am perhaps taking time from my final reflection . )
we could start with the abolishment of this artificial vat delivery .
this is not a replacement for the national contribution .
i am looking forward to cooperating with the european parliament .
member state must be ready to lift this gauntlet .
i beg you , the opportunity is still there .
that is where the question of the budget come in .
we are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity .
this is unacceptable and must not happen in future .
secondly , the vital point of this text concern own resource .
for that is the basis of the european union .
we must therefore return to these own resource a the basis of financing .
that is again , i think , very important .
how can we make sure that their investment are also delivering ?
this can not continue to happen in the future .
'what is it not ? ' 'why a budget review ? '
of course , we have unanimity , and there lie a major problem .
this ha also been covered by others before me .
however , i would like to ask a question here .
perhaps it will get to them through the translation .
will we say 'yes ' or 'no ' to these ?
yet the 2011 budget ha shown this to be untenable .
at the very least , scope for greater flexibility must be introduced .
this increased flexibility should apply from a soon a 2012 .
the treaty state that the eu budget must be financed from own resource .
currently , 80 % of it is financed by transfer from national budget .
this can be done only by having recourse to genuine own resource .
we should not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a dead-end street .
it is a budget which doe not bring u into debt .
this value should continue to be a guiding principle .
mr president , a review of budget is always necessary .
it is good that we are thinking it out again here a well .
secondly , we need to stop scoring own goal .
we have an r & d target of 3 % .
the resource must be used more efficiently in many area .
however , lady and gentleman , parliament ha a good memory .
of course , i am advocating a bottom-up method , based on addition .
i think that it will provide a subject for much discussion in future .
i would like to touch on three of them , each in turn .
secondly , i would like to dwell on the principle involved .
we read this in the text - it is written there plainly .
for example , how can we balance expenditure with income ?
should we cut the first and increase the second ?
we do not need to agree intercontinentally to avoid evasion .
mr garriga and mr surján are disappointed about the figure .
we can not simply make adjustment just like that .
you are disappointed , but this is my reply .
a for agriculture , this is a balanced position .
the next item is question time ( b7-0552/2010 ) .
doe the commission consider that basel iii will accelerate merger between bank ?
mr president , good evening to each and every one of you .
liquidity regulation are subject to an observation period until 2015 .
that is what i can say in answer to your very important question .
what impact ha it had on the large bank ?
what is the situation with basel iii in the u ?
fortunately , we are observing a certain improvement in this matter .
mr president , mr kratsa-tsagaropoulou asked me about liquidity .
the american have played an important part in drawing up the basel standard .
regarding mr papanikolaou 's question , basically we have two facility .
in many country , the food supply situation ha improved .
this lead u to the question i wa asked by mr tarabella .
subject : ensuring respect for air and rail passenger ' right
did this situation speed up work on the rail baltica project ?
with airline , yes , we are pushing for a harmonised philosophy .
subject : road safety 2011-2020 - special measure for school bus and their driver
it led to the strong mobilisation of all party involved .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
we are literally talking about the flower of european youth .
a he acknowledged , 35 000 people died in 2009 .
pedestrian , cyclist and motorcyclist account for 57 % of road accident victim .
vice-president of the commission . - first of all bus .
there ha been a 40 % reduction in casualty in europe .
an annual increase of over 150 ship is currently being recorded .
the european maritime safety agency ( emsa ) also provides technical support .
i wa glad that the commissioner mentioned the cooperation with russia .
subject : cap after 2013 - distribution of direct aid
will the commission say what specific measure it ha taken in this connection ?
what criterion is it considering for direct aid distribution ?
subject : measure to prevent soil erosion under the cap post-2013
subject : new framework for the eu common agricultural policy 2014-2020
subject : taking account of biodiversity in the reform of the cap
would it be possible to use this new policy to restore agricultural biodiversity ?
this is a system we wish to abandon and replace with objective criterion .
sound agriculture can help to preserve biodiversity and halt the extinction of specie .
i have explained to you that this wa the government 's decision .
however , there ha been a fall-off in the production of molluscs/shellfish .
thank you , commissioner , for your comprehensive response .
i just want to ask whether the commission is aware of this .
i believe that the commission can play an important role .
that is why we have a labelling chapter in our cfp reform .
how doe it ass the implementation of the regulation to date ?
which member state could serve a example of best practice ?
have the member state made sufficient use of the european fishery fund ?
the next eff committee will have presentation on the use of these possibility .
the implementation of the greek operational programme for 2007-2013 is delayed .
i am sorry to say this , but it really is delayed .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your comprehensive reply .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:30 and resumed at 21:00 )
the legislation from 2000 wa non-binding and not very efficient .
we have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8 % .
this is a problem that leaf smes in extreme difficulty .
therefore , it should not be difficult to pay it creditor punctually .
for payment delay should be the exception and not the rule .
i would like to thank everyone for their cooperation and attention .
we can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation .
i include in that both the council and the commission .
we must insist that member state implement this proposal a soon a possible .
it is devoid of meaning if you let public authority off the hook .
i think this is what this directive will achieve .
we must apply a background regulation which make this deadline possible .
a regard sanction , enterprise and authority must be treated equally .
no provision have been made to facilitate this in the proposal .
finally , i would just like to mention one point .
nevertheless , i think that we can be satisfied with the final form .
in particular , i thank my friend małgorzata handzlik of the epp .
farmer often do not receive timely payment for their produce .
the resulting proposal is therefore largely discriminatory towards such smaller town .
i hope that this new approach can be a real opportunity for change .
this directive is sure to improve the liquidity of company .
in spain , it is 138 day , and in italy 128 .
fortunately , this doe not relate to late payment by consumer .
this change creates a high quality instrument , and i congratulate mr weiler .
they are exposed to the dominance of buyer and large chain store .
we must now tackle the black sheep of the industry .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 20 october , at 12:30 .
i am disappointed that the 5 % penalty ha been removed .
a fixed period of 30 day is proposed a the payment period .
this term may be extended to 60 day in specific case .
this sort of practice must be brought to an end .
this reinforces economic inequality and also significantly reduces competition .
i sincerely thank the rapporteur for this extremely valuable report and excellent result .
the next item is the commission statement on the sludge catastrophe in hungary .
the hungarian authority have deployed massive human resource and equipment .
step are now being taken towards the next phase of decontamination and rehabilitation .
it wa deployed immediately for a week in the affected area .
the commission is also looking into the question of environmental legislation .
i know that she visited budapest and expressed the same thought there .
you have just talked about the possibility of mobilising structural fund .
you also mentioned that you are thinking about mandatory assistance a well .
yes , it ha no mean to handle such situation .
the tragic event in hungary is also a loss for europe .
fellow member , i propose that we transform the solidarity fund .
thirdly , member state implementation of the mining waste directive should be accelerated .
yet i wish to make three comment following your speech , commissioner georgieva .
yet i wish to ask the commission to carry out an in-depth investigation .
that is impossible ; there ha to have been a mistake somewhere .
that is why i would like to ask a few question .
finally , commissioner , you spoke of mitigating the effect of the sludge .
madam president , something absolutely unprecedented happened in this chamber today .
i would like this case to be properly investigated .
mr nigel farage did something which wa far le provocative and offensive .
he wa fined and had to go through disciplinary action .
( sv ) what doe the commissioner think about this ?
what should be done and how quickly can we do it ?
let u be honest : this red sludge is not considered hazardous waste ?
these technique include , for example , two protective wall .
however , that must not mean that we leave everything a it is .
it wa established in 2002 when the flood happened .
that is not the purpose of the solidarity fund .
however , i would like to make a suggestion .
your environmental disaster focused the attention of the whole world on hungary .
( nl ) i shall now switch to dutch .
proper transposition and implementation of the directive on waste is central and necessary .
europe 's environmental and raw material plan are very ambitious .
a human and environmental disaster of this nature must never recur .
madam president , this drama reminds u of our responsibility a politician .
we already have a full environmental acquis in the european mining waste directive .
that is another way of encouraging business owner to operate safely .
parliament ha taken a stand in this chamber on these issue .
i absolutely agree with what you said about the solidarity fund .
one example of such legislation is that relating to liability .
you gave a good coverage of all the issue that we are facing .
before i get into answer , just let me say the following .
first , on the question of legislation and the role of the commission .
that again would be work we will follow up very thoroughly .
hungary ha dedicated structural fund and rural development fund at it disposal .
we also had quite different view on the solidarity fund .
there have been question that were directed to the role of the commission .
the inspection and the monitoring are a member state responsibility .
we do not have a mandate in the commission to do it .
there have been question relating to the recycling of red sludge .
of course , it is terrible that the disaster happened in 2010 .
there are three thing i would like to say .
we can learn an important lesson from the incident in hungary .
the accident in hungary also provides an example of european solidarity .
we know there are many more such reservoir in hungary .
database relating to racial and ethnic origin in the eu ( debate )
the french authority , however , deny the existence of such a database .
if you want something , you go straight for your goal .
i wish you would be a determined in this particular case .
why doe the commission not start it own investigation ?
you know that a majority in this house is behind you .
do we have proof that they exist or do not exist ?
if it is legal , we do not need a debate .
if it is illegal , we need to start infringement procedure .
in this case , i think that the commission should act .
the rom must not be criminalised , and that is the crucial point .
ethnically motivated database for the purpose of preventing crime are unlawful .
that is the normal way we proceed with all member state .
france ha done exactly what the commission ha asked it to do .
and these procedural right have not been implemented in french law .
that is one thing that i think is some kind of a victory .
now we have got dossier on individual , several pile of them .
so , a of today , we have these two case .
first , the commission is closely following development in these matter .
this might be the case only for immigration-related purpose .
the most controversial database related to criminal activity of youngster of caribbean origin .
i have one thing to say on the subject of the men file .
you have the conclusion of the cnil report submitted to the prime minister .
you have mentioned a number of point which you apparently consider unsatisfactory .
it is just that the national gendarmerie ha a number of file which ...
yet it is true and i would like you to acknowledge the fact .
your attitude is close to becoming an unhealthy preoccupation .
you mentioned a timetable , a timetable for transposition which is in progress .
this also occurred during the summer and it is happening now with database .
the answer to the other question is also very important .
i doubt that greatly , commission , and i am a historian .
i have many doubt because even the journalist have doubt .
it will continue to be spoken of in this house .
what evidence doe the commission need to take the matter further ?
yet the subject of today 's discussion is discrimination .
they do not dare to leave their makeshift encampment .
that is what the association are telling u , commissioner .
that is the current situation of the rom in france .
let u drop the subject of the men file .
the gendarmerie ha announced that it ha been deleted .
parliament must sponsor a conference on the integration of the rom community .
it is a risk which this institution can not afford to run .
( hu ) ethnic discrimination is clearly prohibited by eu and international law .
i wish to stress that no satisfactory solution ha been reached so far .
information on ethnic or racial origin is not normally included in that .
i myself come from a country with 500 000 citizen .
the rom live in most of our member state in extreme poverty .
mr president , yesterday , we had a discussion on the budget .
thank you very much for your support in this matter .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
it focal point will , without doubt , be economic governance .
all these recommendation can be implemented quickly through legislation .
clearly , these are not easy issue , either technically or politically .
they will be discussed at the european council next week .
we believe this is a good basis for reaching a compromise .
so , let no one blame europe if nothing change in this respect .
at this stage , the commission will concentrate on the substance .
we need others to match the flexibility the european union ha already shown .
we need to keep up the momentum on the g20 a well .
i want the financial sector to play a part in this .
we should go into the un process with plenty of confidence and determination .
our citizen show their concern and we must take them into consideration .
we have proposed some important piece of legislation on economic governance .
these concern are also echoed in the excellent report by mr feio .
we have proposed a wide range of financial market regulation measure .
we are pursuing a holistic approach to covering the different dimension involved .
these are , first and foremost , financial resource .
some of these solution will be short- and others long-term .
parliament is demonstrating or could demonstrate a firm voice on all these issue .
i feel obliged in these circumstance to disown my opinion .
we would like it if this could be more than just a study .
a you can imagine , that is quite an honour for our group .
i welcome the work that the commission ha done along these line .
i call on president van rompuy to heed this message .
currency dumping and the social consequence it entail must no longer be allowed .
that is why we insist on the financial transaction tax .
i ask myself when mr van rompuy will draw the appropriate conclusion .
normally , what we have to do is to ask for a convention .
if you have enough support in the council , go for it .
i find this completely incomprehensible , certainly from germany .
it amount to a weakening of the bold proposal of the commission .
do you all know the film 'jules et jim ' ?
well , there is a woman - mr merkel .
we know who jules is - it is mr sarkozy .
it is not enough to say 'i want ' .
a 0.01 % tax on financial transaction would be worth eur 80 billion .
however , this presupposes that we have a european vision .
what is also needed here is solidarity , however .
can you not see the danger that is threatening u today ?
next year , it will be gbp 8 billion .
it will have quadrupled in the space of six year .
perhaps you would be so kind a to answer it for u .
you are so concerned about the british tax coffer .
in my view , what would that common position be ?
instead , we are now seeing a continuation of such inappropriate behaviour .
we want to overcome the mistake of the past .
we did this in the case of supervision of the financial market .
we are doing so with the report in response to the crisis .
the report by the five group sends a clear message .
fiscal and monetary policy are no substitute for structural reform .
the task force and the deauville route have failed .
we are right at the very beginning of the legislative process .
on governance , i would mention only two point at this early stage .
unfortunately , the last few day have been a disappointment .
our message is : leave mr rehn 's proposal alone !
nationalism must not be allowed to gain a foothold in europe again .
unfortunately , there is scant reference to this in the report .
my second point , which is linked to the first , is this .
no , this is the result of decision taken by european politician .
what is at stake here is a conscious choice between value system .
i address those word to the council a well .
we must now do everything that is possible under the treaty of lisbon .
in many instance , the measure adopted pursue national interest and consideration .
there is no free money and there are no short cut .
we criticised the stability pact and the functioning of the european central bank .
and what is the ecb doing while this is going on ?
it seems clear to me that this is a europe for banker .
mr merkel dared to say it and she wa shouted down .
yes , we agree with those member who want greater commitment to reform .
however , we then need to discus the substance .
where is the point in your proposal where we can make this difference ?
this parliament will not have the wool pulled over it eye .
the creation of a european common treasury is a political decision .
on one side , are those who advocate a strong community approach .
it is a wage battle - a wage competition .
neither the commission nor the feio report have addressed this problem .
today , citizen are asking for the opposite : deed , not word .
we need to move forward together , with a united european spirit .
we will be equally active , but without concession .
initiative are needed to combat the growing internal divergence in the european union .
specific proposal are needed on the european monetary fund .
there are many question about what action to take now .
by delaying this reform , we are foregoing potential influence .
in the current global circumstance , europe can not afford to do that .
we could do the same with the statement published after our european summit .
endless promise and empty word , never followed up with action .
i am tempted to add , 'no more bet ! '
the berès report conduct such an analysis , and it is excellent .
in europe , i think the crisis ha become one of integration .
the committee ha now been extended by a further year .
in other word : are we all following the same approach ?
this morning , i have not heard anyone talk about this strategy .
i think that is one of the most important challenge .
that is more of a policy for disintegration than integration and competitiveness .
that is also the aim for the european agenda .
without deficit reduction , there can be no access to international market .
without access to international market , there can be no recovery .
they have an opportunity to make their case to the council .
i think our reaction should ultimately be a positive one .
in conclusion , i have one final appeal or request . commissioner .
i think this is really what we have to do now .
we have been promised improved economic governance in europe .
each country must prescribe the form of governance that it need .
the first reaction of member state were not in harmony with each other .
member state must harmonise their budgetary policy and share these with each other .
the rescue measure were positive , despite serious weakness .
those are the currency war and commodity price volatility .
we must also deal with this problem at it source .
it is restrictive , but we have no choice .
i should like to reply to two or three of those speech .
we need to speak with one european voice , both internally and externally .
it is time to move from word to action .
parliament ha a series of different proposal in relation to the other institution .
so far , we have only seen the beginning .
they embody parliament 's involvement in a subject area a important a this .
the vote will take place today , wednesday , 20 october 2010 .
the crisis in recent year ha sorely tried most of the advanced economy .
this reform process will create the condition required for economic recovery .
this is a crisis that we are unable to bring under control .
the next step is the european commission carrying out a feasibility study .
this is leading to a social explosion and comprehensive injustice .
we must defend the euro , and oppose any short-term political aim .
it therefore indicates a moment that separate one stage from another .
we can not allow competition to undermine the protection of worker ' right .
mr president , may i ask you to make a ruling please ?
we see that balloon are displayed in the chamber .
can you make a ruling on whether that is permissible or not .
if it is not , may they be removed ?
dear colleague , we will vote today on this very important issue .
it is a small gesture for all of u .
my thanks also go to president barroso and to vice-president šefčovič .
the result ha been very good , so i congratulate both side .
i am looking forward to good collaboration in the future .
we believe that this agreement will be useful to the european union .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
formal sitting - mid-term address by jerzy buzek , president of parliament
we are at the mid-way point of my presidency .
a the president of the european parliament , i represent all of you .
draft general budget of the european union - 2011 financial year ( vote )
i am only too happy to go more slowly ...
we , a parliament , will obviously play our part in full .
parliament 's calendar of part-sessions - 2012 ( vote )
i therefore believe that we should vote through this postponement today .
mr schulz spoke in favour of mr daul 's proposal .
( parliament approved the request to defer the vote )
it would be good if this could be corrected .
i hope that you all can accept this oral amendment .
we do not wish in any way to deprive you of any right .
mr president , i have the following comment for my fellow meps .
today wa the first time post-lisbon that we have voted on the budget .
let u not draw this out any longer now , however .
i voted in favour of the report by mr rangel .
parliament will have the right to obtain confidential document .
parliament is striving for better and more transparent cooperation with other institution .
i would like to offer him my congratulation at this point .
it is now up to u to use these new right responsibly .
why is this resolution of the european parliament being ignored ?
it is our duty to be ambitious for a more social europe .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the rangel report .
particularly important are the amendment improving legal procedure and strengthening parliamentary scrutiny .
to be a cohesive force , the european union must have credibility .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the rangel report .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the rangel report and .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the rangel report and .
we were told that the eeas would be budget-neutral .
budget neutrality is now but another eu promise whistling in the wind .
the clear distribution of right and obligation will allow it to work smoothly .
the annual activity report are also provided to the budgetary authority .
this is what a huge section of our parliament want .
you can be sure that we will help you .
the amendment provided for in this resolution is therefore necessary .
those who are absent are always in the wrong .
now we have to take care that this doe really happen .
this creates confidence in the process of establishing the external action service .
i am going to be watching the process very carefully .
a few issue have not yet been cleared up sufficiently .
possible effect on the building cost must be subject to prior scrutiny .
we firmly oppose the creation of a european external action service .
the proposed annual breakdown provides an amount of eur 75 million in 2010 .
for these reason , we abstained from the vote on the report .
this is the first budget following the treaty of lisbon .
there ha been increasing volatility in international dairy market in recent year .
i agree then with the eur 300 million increase in the milk fund .
we have just adopted the 2011 budget that the european parliament wanted .
it is for others to justify why they endorsed it .
a large proportion of the budget go to the eu 's agricultural policy .
the treaty of lisbon entered into force on 1 december last year .
i believe it is time to have done with all this .
i support the european parliament 's proposal for the draft 2011 budget .
financial recovery from the agricultural pot should be used for their original purpose .
some further step to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged .
however , i can not support tendency to centralise .
the enhancement of the daphne programme dealing with violence against woman is gratifying .
those who are absent are always in the wrong .
now we have to take care that this doe really happen .
this creates confidence in the process of establishing the external action service .
i am going to be watching the process very carefully .
i did not feel able to oppose this budget .
we still have a lot to do to reconcile working and family life .
a child also ha an undisputable right to bond with both parent .
the birth rate in many member state is still undoubtedly very low .
this will be the only way to promote parenthood with shared responsibility .
i declare that i voted for this report for the reason outlined above .
according to the statistic , the birth rate is falling in the eu .
legislation can not continue to discriminate against this type of parenthood .
this would result in the cost of maternity leave in the uk doubling .
woman is the future of man , wrote louis aragon .
freedom of choice is also a right for woman .
applying these measure pose a very great risk to the employment of woman .
another advance would have been to have progressive measure concerning childcare method .
this text improves the balance between family life and work life .
business and social protection system are already paying these cost .
the situation is similar with woman living and working in the countryside .
this obviously put both their health and their child in jeopardy .
those are cost that neither national government nor taxpayer can currently afford .
i expressed a different opinion in the vote on the question of leave .
i prefer the commission 's proposal of 18 week .
woman should not be over-protected being shunned by the labour market .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report .
anything that can contribute to changing this situation is therefore important .
we would not want this measure to mean a step backwards for woman .
this can be described a both a quantitative and qualitative improvement .
i support improving the european minimum standard for maternity protection .
the austrian rule go far beyond the minimum standard stipulated in this report .
i voted in favour of maternity leave lasting 20 week .
in finland , there is a viable system for maternity and parental leave .
neither should the female dominated sector have to bow to excessive economic pressure .
it is vitally important to see that that doe not happen .
nutrition is a key determinant of health throughout life .
the vote on mr estrela 's report is vitally important .
i did so after lobbying from supporter and opponent .
it is a step to close the existing gender pay gap .
apart from death and tax , birth is the only certainty in life .
extending maternity leave is one of the mean to that end .
for this reason , i support an extension to maternity leave .
the time ha come to combat stereotype that have taken root in society .
the risk of poverty for working people in this group is 24 % .
it wa a long road until the eu legally guaranteed gender equality .
however , i would ask some question of principle .
who is going to foot the bill for that ?
i voted for this text , which represents genuine progress for woman .
the directive ha yet to be accepted by the council .
this is certainly a case of progress therefore , and i welcome it .
many company went bankrupt during the crisis and this is a huge loss .
the negative effect of late payment in commercial transaction are therefore considerable .
i hope that this new approach can be a real opportunity for change .
late payment is a massive economic problem in commercial transaction within the eu .
clearly defined payment deadline will put a stop to these method .
this need is even more pressing and essential at these time of crisis .
the european parliament 's contribution wa substantial in this matter .
i would like to congratulate mr weiler on her outstanding work .
i have thrown the full weight of my support behind this agreement .
this is of particular importance for payment between company and government body .
that would be good for our company and good for job .
the international community ha confirmed it commitment to combating poverty on several occasion .
the economic crisis ha exacerbated the situation of many european .
however , i am against having a minimum income at european union level .
such a measure would be demagogic and totally ill-suited in the current situation .
this provides another reason for me to vote in favour of this campaign .
rarely have i come across such a demagogic and unrealistic report .
is that gross average income or net average income ?
current data show that poverty level in the european union are increasing .
it is our job to secure a decent life for all citizen .
i am therefore voting in favour of this important report .
among these , poverty must certainly come high up on the list .
a minimum income for citizen is a remedy , not a solution .
extraordinary and exceptional help should be considered in these precise case .
extraordinary and exceptional help should be considered , strictly in these case .
i voted in favour of mr figueiredo 's report .
eighty-five million people are threatened with poverty in europe .
i am firmly opposed to the report on those ground .
in other word , we should give them the know-how they need .
development aid must be linked to the creation of condition for developing trade .
the economic crisis ha been aggravating the social inequality in the eu .
however , that is not enough to combat unemployment .
simply having work doe not offer protection from poverty .
elderly people also face a higher risk of poverty than the general population .
the future is part of fulfilling the content of this initiative .
europe doe not need further centralisation of economic power at eu level .
i have thus decided to vote in favour of this report .
i voted to adopt this report for two reason .
it is now time for europe to get going again .
in a constantly changing world , inertia is tantamount to decline .
the text call for establishing a true european community for energy .
we do not need le europe , we need more of it !
this report call for europe to be unanimous on essential issue .
small and medium-sized enterprise , in particular , need easier access to credit .
it is important for parliament to offer clear answer to crisis .
we need a fairer distribution of wealth between country and within each country .
the financial crisis put an end to the fairytale of self-regulating financial market .
in the long term , they only displace the underlying problem .
the crisis must absolutely not be used to extend eu competence .
eurocracy and bureaucracy are no answer to the crisis .
they only europeanise the penalty , which are now even stricter .
i wa sad to vote against the berès report .
i would stress the importance of cohesion instrument in this process .
we are also experiencing a huge crisis in public confidence .
in writing . - ( lt ) i voted for this report .
all this ha sown instability and decline in europe .
adopting the euro wa a gamble of fundamental importance for the eu .
this is why i voted in favour of adopting the document .
without rule or supervision , you can not make any progress .
my vote is therefore , without doubt , in favour of the report .
all the issue and solution detailed in the report are extremely timely .
in any case , these are the most important and necessary reform .
they only europeanise the penalty , which have been made even stricter .
for example , it is essential to respect the stability and growth pact .
i am voting for the report for the reason given above .
the recommendation provided in this report are a good start .
that would impede our effort towards economic growth and cohesion .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
τhe next item is the joint debate on the following report :
despite this , the size of the funding is relatively small .
what is the mid-term review of this instrument about ?
this is important to u , in other word .
to do otherwise would not be in the spirit of the agreement .
the european court of justice ha ruled in favour .
i found this to be a very important point .
my final point concern the issue of delegated act .
kindly do not interrupt the session with such point .
however , this is only one side of the coin .
on the other side is the political significance of this matter .
this is the purport of the amendment which we hereby wish to support .
work on human right often take place under very difficult condition .
that review concluded that the instrument are working well .
we are glad that we have your support on these technical issue .
here , the commission took the view of this house fully into account .
parliament ha already approved a budget for this instrument in 2010 .
this will provide ample scope for funding civil society action .
this show the capacity of ngo in peacebuilding and crisis response .
banana were the subject of the world 's longest-running trade dispute .
this consultation process go beyond the strict bound of comitology .
let me be clear : we definitely need to find a solution now .
i feel confident that we can find a solution if we act together .
mr president , i am speaking on the subject of the ici+ instrument .
the commission then created the little instrument that is the ici instrument .
unfortunately , the commission saw this a an interim solution .
parliament gave up 16 scrutiny instrument when it created the dci .
now we have a stability instrument for post-crisis development .
this also mean robust support for civil society building .
the lisbon treaty ha to make the eu more coherent and efficient .
we have understood in this parliament the need for technical modification .
this concern delegated act and the european parliament 's right to scrutiny .
that is what is keeping u busy here this afternoon .
however , there are other important change which have occurred in the meantime .
that , too , is a very important innovation .
this clearly show that we need a stronger position .
we need the power to codecide on where the money go .
parliament also ha a responsibility towards the citizen of the european union .
the president of pakistan say : i am president zardari , your president .
the thief say : in that case , i want my money !
this is relevant to the debate today because it emphasis the key point .
i also want to say a quick word about the delegated act .
the spirit of the treaty of lisbon need to make itself felt here .
we can do it without the consent of their respective government .
mr president , thank you for giving me the floor .
mr president , it is exactly in the flexibility that the beauty lie .
for my part , i would like to make three brief observation .
i call on the commission to do just that .
the agricultural model should be reshaped towards greater self-sufficiency .
this , i believe , is a key statement which illustrates our duty .
instead of giving to european consumer , we are taking away from them .
at this particular juncture , therefore , we should not behave like marie-antoinette .
secondly , we should cut our travel cost by flying economy class .
worst of all , however , is the brantner report .
it is not handed out by a giant tooth fairy .
we consider that democracy is a human achievement that need to be safeguarded .
when million of people are unemployed , can we talk of democracy ?
can anyone say that funding democracy in afghanistan pushed democracy forward ?
with this , of course , also come an increase in responsibility .
europe and the eu should and must take the lead .
at present , they are simply beyond the understanding of many .
finally , the commission must work to relax financial regulation .
the eu is the world 's biggest donor of development aid .
the european union is , in fact , releasing substantial fund .
these fund should not be made inaccessible because procedure are too complex .
i believe that we have experience that we can be proud of .
financial instrument definitely help u to address these challenge .
it is necessary to adopt banana accompanying measure a soon a possible .
i believe that this house wa very supportive of it .
we are not prejudging what will happen after 2013 .
i believe my colleague will also come forward with issue .
one is definitely this house , but the other is the council .
i have every reason to believe that we will find the necessary compromise .
then there wa another thing that i would like to highlight .
the tool that it need include the stability instrument .
i would like to thank my fellow member for participating in this debate .
that is why parliament 's right of supervision is very important .
we already need to be thinking about a post-2013 strategy .
baroness ashton wa not able to remain with u today .
commissioner füle will present the matter on her behalf .
in recent time , ukraine ha enjoyed a high level of political freedom .
ukraine ha developed a dynamic and diverse civil society and medium environment .
these reform go in the right direction and must be sustained .
they are an essential component of truly open , innovative and competitive society .
that is why we are having this debate ahead of the municipal election .
we put forward our european experience a an alternative .
we want ukraine to continue down this road with u .
( pl ) thank you for allowing my question .
it is always good to be able to start such a debate .
what are your view on russia in this context ?
is equating ukraine and russia not doing ukraine an injustice ?
the supposed economic achievement there still need to demonstrate their effectiveness .
it is a country which face a lot of challenge .
the real problem of this debate is a problem we have here .
we were too fast in dividing that country into pro-westerners and pro-easterners .
this abuse is getting worse and that really must concern u .
in brief , ukraine is the wild west of eastern europe .
let u not make any judgment before they have been held .
that is what you fought for together , whether blue or orange .
do not be surprised - i am talking to our ukrainian brother .
we believe that in the future , you will be among u .
this is precisely why this resolution is needed today .
mr president , i have a very simple question .
( lv ) yes , i shall gladly clarify this point .
( lv ) yes , i am happy to reply .
it is a clear attempt to influence the election .
we should not allow our parliament to be part of this game .
mr president , the new ukrainian authority are new only in name .
a regression towards authoritarian practice is sweeping the country .
it is time for u to clearly express our concern through a resolution .
we , too , need to show that we are responsible .
we can not allow ourselves to become embroiled in the internal political argument .
a resolution would only make sense after the forthcoming election in ukraine .
i agree with what mr kamiński and others have said .
my colleague probably consider them better partner than the current government .
however , the west is watching the process closely .
more need to be done in ukraine in this field .
i shall stop speaking now , if i may .
please be very brief and respond to the personal allusion .
he made a point that wa not entirely correct .
that is why the joint resolution no longer contains the quotation .
you spoke about the rule of law in general .
i also brought this up in my talk with prime minister azarov .
however , the current picture is not without ambiguity .
it would be more important to create condition for development .
one of those is easing tension in the region .
the next item is question time ( b7-0552/2010 ) .
subject : un convention on the right of person with disability
i would like to thank the council for it response .
what do you think the impact of that will be ?
i would like to return to a point mentioned .
the situation leaf a great deal to be desired .
i do not think there is any particular reason for this .
author . - thank you , council , for your response .
i will pas on your appreciation to my colleague , gay mitchell .
subject : coordination of the eu 's position in cancún
at the end of the day , they have to be binding .
anything else will not deal with this unfortunate situation .
should the eu not take on an important role a a mediator here ?
to answer these two question , i can not agree with you more .
the union should change strategy in relation to copenhagen .
subject : programme of the presidency - early school leaving
( el ) thank you , minister , for your reply .
i would like to thank the president for his very comprehensive reply .
the reality is that landmines are still being used .
unfortunately , we can not go much further in term of decision making .
subject : creation of an observatory on violence against woman
what will be it objective and mission and when will it become operational ?
we expect to receive it some time next year .
( lt ) minister , thank you for your answer .
i would remind you of the agency for fundamental right in vienna .
it would be good if that could be arranged .
you will tell me that we are in 2010 now .
in this way , we will also achieve more green job .
in this way , we will also successfully combat climate change .
i had expected more detail but i thank you for it .
i understand , and we are obviously all sensitive to the irish problem .
i would like to thank the president-in-office for his answer .
can we expect an initiative to address the north/south divide in the union ?
therefore , this harmonisation is ongoing and under way .
subject : council measure in favour of free movement of labour between member state
( ro ) minister , thank you for your reply .
can we expect an evaluation of this plan and a new council proposal ?
we also have the leonardo da vinci programme on job mobility .
can we expect further support for this programme or similar new initiative ?
aid for pakistan and possible implication for the european industrial sector ( debate )
the scale of the disaster is unprecedented in pakistan 's history .
the initial eu response to the flood wa swift and generous .
this alone represents more than 60 % of the global initial un appeal .
trade is therefore part of the long-term response to the ongoing crisis .
this proposal is now submitted to member state and the european parliament .
other industrial product such a ethanol are also included .
trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for pakistan .
it is used for a huge number of purpose .
now i use the word 'ask ' with some care .
asking is exactly what the british prime minister ha had to do .
i rarely agree with david martin but i do on this .
trade preference for pakistan at this time may perhaps help stop that happening .
i do not think we can even imagine what that is like .
the commission ha not proposed using the generalised system of preference .
is that really major , durable aid to pakistan ?
i am firmly convinced that we have to help pakistan .
this really is now a test of the eu 's credibility .
we are , after all , their largest trading partner .
the product that pakistan may export are ethanol , textile and leather good .
spain represents 16 % of the volume of business from the textile sector .
ha consideration been given to reducing the list of textile product ?
it is certainly the case that money is needed .
however , we in parliament now have a responsibility .
pakistan need money and aid now - not in a year 's time .
however , is that not the whole point of it ?
people have also talked about the need for greater diversity .
trade concession are not long-term measure , a i have been saying .
clearly , therefore , this is a very serious issue .
on the other hand , however , member have also raised this point .
i would add greece ; you all know the problem it is facing .
we are talking about a trade volume of eur 900 million .
it is simply not serious to put that argument forward .
on the contrary , a lot of semi-finished product are included .
we will continue to do so ; that is more aid .
trade is not aid , a ha been said in this plenary .
it is also very important to u and to our security .
so this is an overall array of measure which we are employing .
i wish her much success in carrying it further through the legislative process .
the cost will notably depend on the production process and technical marking rule .
therefore , it is important to keep these cost to a minimum .
we are therefore able to draw useful lesson from the experience of others .
one of my favourite example is this shirt that i am wearing .
it wa designed in hong kong and finally sewn together in china .
this is not a proposal that provides better information .
that is precisely why this type of regulation is prohibited within the eu .
in order to get ourselves out of recession , we should facilitate trade .
i should like to thank you too , commissioner , for your commitment .
eu law also provides for penalty measure in the event of violation ...
( the speaker stop and then resume at the invitation of the president )
let u take the example of india , where child labour is prohibited .
the gathered cotton is then shipped to vietnam , where it is processed .
the european court of justice decree that the commission ...
we are mostly talking about poor quality and often harmful good .
this is a direct result of our tradition and european legal order .
for the rest , let u wait and see .
this is in accordance with the regulation of the world trade organisation .
so the question is why have we not yet found a compromise ?
all of u agree on the need to inform the consumer citizen .
i would like to apologise , sir , for disturbing you .
our product are often the victim of counterfeiting and misleading marking .
an important instrument , but only that : an instrument .
i would like to see this going much further .
so , well done to my colleague , mr muscardini .
in fact , our proposal fully relies on them .
that is why the commission can accept the amendment proposed .
the vote will take place on thursday , 21 october 2010 .
well , in two word , we are almost there .
they have resolved nearly all issue with only a few still open .
let me now highlight some of the main feature of acta .
firstly , a broad coverage of intellectual property right ( iprs ) .
it would not be in the draft acta treaty without the european commission .
million of counterfeit good are traded every day through the internet .
let me stress that acta will not change the eu acquis .
european exception , like private or educational use , will also remain valid .
what is the state of play and the next step in acta ?
well , in tokyo , it wa not possible to finalise the text .
there are , in particular , two issue open .
i would be interested to hear your view on this issue .
it also strike a proper balance with the right of citizen and consumer .
i think it is a good thing that the acquis communautaire remains unchanged .
i would encourage you to show perseverance with regard to the outstanding issue .
commissioner , i asked for transparency and you responded .
the world is changing rapidly , and we are all aware of this .
however , let u get serious here for a minute .
is it your wish that such an abuse be possible ?
there is also the question of the internet , a already mentioned .
and yet you are willing to sign up to the agreement now .
that is why i would ask you firstly : have you already signed ?
if not , when do you intend to sign ?
there are obviously difference of opinion in this house on intellectual property right .
it is clearly a key issue for copyright and trademark holder .
it is a question for you , mr commissioner .
the original aim of the agreement wa to improve enforcement .
europe must continue to concentrate on two fundamental point .
however , we are constantly being fobbed off with word .
how can we agree to an agreement that is being negotiated in backroom ?
this implies extra-judicial measure and challenge the division of power ' .
would it mean streaming the internet in order to identify violation ?
when can we expect this impact assessment in relation to the acta agreement ?
this is decisive in enabling u to evaluate this agreement .
flexibility for our member state is recognised ; we support that .
i heard this most recently here in plenary today .
i am certain that citizen will feel that way , too .
if this doe not mean three strike , what doe it mean ?
i am still not clear about the actual situation with regard to generic .
then the question of trademark protection versus origin marking arises .
these are all thing that give me cause for concern .
yesterday , your commission published a strategy to that effect .
reassure u that people in developing country have a right to healthcare .
it is not enough merely to control the border .
acta is about tackling large-scale , illegal activity and pursuing criminal organisation .
it is not about limiting civil liberty or harassing consumer .
nobody ha pointed to an infringement of the acquis communautaire .
if you give u example , we will look into them .
how can you say that this ha happened behind closed door ?
you would expect that when you do that , you would be applauded .
maybe i would be better investing my time in something else .
the agreement will become definitive once the european parliament ha given it consent .
so let u respect the treaty and let u respect the framework agreement .
the acquis communautaire is about substantive law and we are not changing that .
it is understandable that u official stress the same line .
it is in the e-commerce directive and we are simply referring to that .
million of job in europe depend on respect for intellectual property right .
the vote will take place at the next part-session .
financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human right worldwide (
cambodia , in particular the case of sam rainsy (
- i declare adjourned the session of the european parliament .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i would like to make several statement at the beginning of this part-session .
some people were killed , and others were injured .
this is also a subject which can be raised in a one-minute speech .
thank you , mr berlinguer , for raising this matter .
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
mr president , i am not going to speak for very long .
it ha already been deferred once , before the election .
we should not now defer it until after the eu-ukraine summit .
it is important to make clear our positive approach to ukraine .
it is a european country that must have a european perspective .
we are practically the last to take a position on this .
we should not bring about the loss of our own credibility .
if we speak out , they will listen and be aware .
if we do not speak out , they will note that a well .
that is why we favour a decision on the resolution at this part-session .
of course , everyone ha a right to change their mind .
i recommend that we make our decision in november .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
council and commission statement on the eu-us data protection agreement .
each party will have to decide this for itself .
the negotiation on these specific agreement are under great time pressure .
we will state our joint intent to resist protectionism at home and abroad .
we will focus on expanding the economic benefit of the transatlantic economy .
will they succeed in jointly promoting open ict service network and transparent regulation ?
the relaunch of the tec is an attempt to develop this strategic relationship .
the next tec meeting will take place on 17 december in washington .
i look forward to the debate that will now ensue .
this recommendation for a mandate is now being discussed in the council .
in the past , personal data protection ha been a recurrent issue .
each of these ha it own ad hoc data protection rule .
that mean a patchwork of different safeguard and provision for processing personal data .
i also believe that we need to be ambitious .
i believe that we must act jointly to counter protectionism .
today , the commission published a paper on energy - energy 2020 .
however , it need to be done in a coordinated way .
that strategic partnership must be rooted in economic and political freedom .
i wa very pleased to hear vice-president reding on the data protection agreement .
it is a great prize worth a lot of effort .
we need to breathe new life into the tec .
mr president , we believe that cooperation should not preclude independence .
we believe that the european union should learn self-respect .
we believe that good cooperation presupposes respect for the other side 's independence .
we must convince the united state to shoulder it real responsibility .
we know how important this is in order to reach the millennium objective .
the doha agreement will be a significant step forward in this important sector .
close cooperation with our u partner is necessary and right .
this might be a possibility if china respected international intellectual property right .
some hope of that if we continue to embrace globalism .
it doe not mean , however , that the opportunity are not there .
it is simply that the context is a little bit more complicated .
doe it consider the transatlantic relationship more important than question from meps ?
the u should respect the eu 's independence and it complementary role .
we hope that you can persuade it to think again on this .
in my view , this is the main message of tomorrow 's resolution .
i hope that the forthcoming lisbon summit will be a success .
we have many interest , ideal and value in common .
we will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way .
unfortunately , the commission did so only very briefly .
who really came here to talk about the summit ?
( pt ) the world is experiencing some very difficult time .
the united state is one of europe 's key ally .
neither europe nor the u would allow this to happen .
i wish you good luck for your meeting on 15 december .
together , our economy account for half of the global economy .
in their opinion , is acta a binding or a voluntary agreement ?
europe occupies a smaller role in current american plan and concern .
there is clearly an urgent need for this framework agreement on data protection .
m reding , you have our support on this agreement .
we know , today , that this wa a vain hope .
i think that this element of your announcement today is very important .
that can not happen again , particularly in issue such a quantitative easing .
we have to assert ourselves and have our voice heard .
we must eliminate all the problem here , within the european union .
after all , our highest priority must be to protect our citizen .
this is all we can say at this moment in time .
we will also discus joint response to economic challenge .
the last question wa on the 100 % scanning of inbound container freight .
trying to achieve both in equilibrium will be the content of those negotiation .
i absolutely agree with what ha been said in this house .
the vote will take place on thursday , 11 november 2010 .
it is time , however , that we reviewed this image .
it is now time the eu realised what is happening .
the united state is not going to embark on any emission trading scheme .
these useful act include investing in clean energy and improving energy selfsufficiency .
emission trading , in contrast , is not worth our support .
the forthcoming eu-us summit will certainly confirm the exceptional importance of these relation .
this is significant capital and this line must be pursued .
a large part of u society is opposed to action combating climate change .
the eu-us summit will take place next month in lisbon .
it is also important to increasingly include russia in the transatlantic dialogue .
the commission 's negotiating mandate is therefore heading in the right direction .
it is self-evident that what is needed is cooperation at global level .
more intensive dialogue will be advantageous to both side .
eu external strategy on passenger name record ( pnr ) ( debate )
indeed , we have always required this when concluding agreement with other country .
the issue of profiling wa raised by the belgian presidency a well .
i will try to enlighten you a little bit on this .
this resulted in an eu-us agreement confirming that the eu satisfies these condition .
fourteen member state have identical agreement with the u .
but let me add that none of these bilateral agreement cover pnr data .
the exchange of pnr data only take place under the eu-us agreement .
i will , of course , keep you fully informed about this .
the parliament resolution also refers to the eu-us cooperation on one-stop aviation security .
this is the responsibility of vice-president kallas who is transport commissioner .
this should improve efficiency at eu airport without compromising security .
nobody want that , and i also think it would be very dangerous .
nonetheless , we must still make the effort to resolve this .
the same applies to the forwarding of data to third country .
we also have a problem within the european union .
that is a fact that we have to face up to .
we have had example in the past where the cooperation wa le intimate .
some of the member state are proposing a sunset clause .
however , pnr must only be a tool to combat terrorism .
what benefit will there be to u from their access to it ?
yet we also know a lot about what not to do .
the third condition is that the data transferred be non-discriminatory .
a regard the need , madam president , it is obvious .
development happen , and policy and legislation follow later .
i would willingly add to that the issue of reciprocity .
the statement i have just heard are , regrettably , far from reassuring .
however , a balance need to be found between security and privacy .
that show that it ha learnt from past method .
would we actually supply the name and data for this purpose ?
we should exchange pnr , but that should not be done without rule .
i believe we want absolute freedom from ethnic stigmatisation .
special attention should be paid to the protection of passenger ' personal data .
there is one point on which i feel it is inadequate .
of course , the data must only be stored for a specific purpose .
no agreement wa reached in the council during this period .
specific condition for the granting of a passport have been laid down .
the directive also aim to increase protection for investor .
leverage , the remuneration method and delegation will now be monitored .
thank you very much for your ability to organise that in parliament .
the second element is a truly european solution for third country .
they now have the chance to establish themselves using a sustainable business model .
i would like to express my sincere thanks to mr gauzès .
i would also like to thank mr bullmann and mr goebbels .
there will be very specific rule on risk management and cash management .
the directive will impose more transparency on private equity fund .
these fund will be welcome to finance the real economy .
a a result , we no longer have a problem with it .
we were therefore initially unable to support the proposal a presented in committee .
overall , therefore , we are very pleased with the proposal .
essentially , market access for these product is not restricted effectively .
of course , there are private equity investment that make sense for company .
mr president , i would like to make two comment .
i would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation .
indeed , i wa able to go along with the decision .
in my view , the council ha missed an opportunity here .
a more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard .
these thing have nothing to do with one another .
however , this is not the concern of parliament .
i want to say this once again ; this is passive marketing .
this is a point that mr giegold ha already mentioned .
you can imagine what will come of this - not very much .
but it will certainly succeed in driving manager away from london .
are we in a position to afford such loss of business ?
of course not , but the eu doe not care .
he ha betrayed the city of london - the most important british industry .
do n't come to u to help reactivate the british economy !
unfortunately , however , a major opportunity ha been missed once again .
we have been made helpless in the face of the lobbyist .
we need them and they are good for a strong economy .
we have , in that sense , bettered the legislation .
that is the truth about this regulation that we will vote on tomorrow .
capital ha the ability to respond flexibly and is very mobile .
the fund have different sum , different characteristic and different associated risk .
better regulation will certainly mean that we will have a better market .
a for alternative fund , the supervision system should also apply to them .
we must learn from previous mistake and not repeat them .
it is not enough to talk about supervision and regulation .
that certainly is hard work and hopefully it will pay off .
we will establish a minimum capital requirement of eur 125 000 .
the european security and market authority will be the supervisory body .
i think it will have quite the opposite effect .
it mean a great deal more transparency in the private equity industry .
mr hökmark ha stressed the importance of that industry .
instead of discrimination , we now have a set of simple requirement .
mr goebbels , you mentioned 72 specific power , within 11 different category .
so let me thank each and every one of you .
to conclude , i would like to make two point .
please do let u know if that seems feasible .
we will work towards adopting others in the coming week .
madam president , earlier , i spoke about the technical detail .
france is about to take over the g20 presidency for a year .
it main priority will be to reform the international financial system .
with this vote , europe is blazing a trail .
it wa criticised heavily and for having been drafted in secret .
the next item is the commission statement on the single market act .
the outside world ha question about the reason for the crisis .
then there is the environmental crisis , which is probably the worst .
it is not something you can take or leave .
we have just been discussing the directive on hedge fund and private equity .
we now come to the third chapter of the single market act .
commissioner barnier , parliament will play it part in achieving this goal .
madam president , thank you commissioner barnier for the work you have done .
a commitment to carrying out social impact assessment could satisfy u .
study have been carried out in this area for three year .
therefore , we still need to wait for the commission 's specific proposal .
let me give you two example ; firstly proposal 29 .
but the problem for u arises when we read the text .
this ha been going on for 15 year now .
no wonder that we have problem financing our welfare at this time .
so , mr barnier , i believe we have work to do .
you got a flavour of some of the debate to come .
thus , no progress ha been made for consumer .
so how can we convince the citizen that this directive concern them ?
universal access to quality public service must be the basic political criterion .
where we are , small and medium-sized enterprise account for several million job .
indeed , the new reality being established absolutely require new response .
that is the joint responsibility of all of u .
he gave a very detailed analysis of what europe could do .
it will require partnership on the part of all the eu institution .
we will work with you in the coming month on this .
this is where the real added value of the eu lie .
it is a sea and the wind that enables any ship to sail .
i thank commissioner barnier for this very timely initiative and for his vision .
firstly , and mr gebhardt mentioned it : collective redress .
ever since commissioner van miert 's initiative , the commission ha been consulting .
obviously , i hope that one day we will see this issue resolved .
i think that in this respect , legitimate impatience is starting to show .
let u not even mention the issue of service of general interest .
you say that there will be a communication and action .
it is being said that this is our flagship programme .
i am sure we will have the chance to meet up again .
indeed , the first victim of protectionism would be the single market .
mr harbour indicated that this wa a new commitment .
mr gebhardt and mr tarabella , you touched on collective redress .
we are working on this together , particularly in the area of standardisation .
mr salvini mentioned the region and his own region in particular .
we can not succeed on our own ; this is about working together .
the technology exists , and so doe the need for it .
is the commission prepared to make the most of this momentum ?
'business a usual ' is the prevailing watchword in the eu .
'cohesion ' is increasingly becoming a mere slogan , without any practical meaning .
an example of this is the number of planned legal project .
the fact is , the single market act is a revolution .
it is this commission 's most tangible work programme .
whether this will succeed is primarily up to u politician .
so , let u get on with the work !
the commission 's report contain specific proposal on strengthening the single market .
however , the change taking place in the world demand further measure .
the single market can be made even more unified .
the right of citizen and economic issue are dealt with in separate document .
i fully support the content and timescales of the small business act .
this is the key to integration and sustainable growth in europe .
the single market act is an initiative which i strongly welcome and support .
it seems that here , it is not a topic worthy of attention .
have the urgent , major societal challenge perhaps all been solved already ?
the commission 's innovation strategy is clear , but this question remains open .
mr president , what exactly doe european innovation policy do ?
innovation involves making money , a product or a licence from knowledge .
i am pleased that the commission is going down this path .
that would be a project that everyone out there would understand .
if that is the case , we will give it our full support .
this relates both to energy and to industrial production .
the human factor is at the heart of research and innovation .
nowhere should there be mention of a pre-established single model .
based on this conviction , our group ha taken responsibility for both initiative .
the idea of the innovation partnership ha not yet been completely clearly outlined .
the statement by the council have also not helped to provide definitive clarification .
how much transparency can be expected in order for stakeholder to participate ?
what role will the commission , the member state and the region play ?
how can accountability be ensured within a complex structure ?
however , the time ha now come for u to be more pragmatic .
cohesion policy can make innovation work across all member state and region .
in the past , europe ha had a leading role in innovation .
i believe that particular attention must be focused on regional development project .
innovation partnership should focus on this objective a well .
i wish to stress the importance of a bottom-up approach in innovation .
the success of these initiative is achieved precisely through establishing viable partnership .
that would run counter to our goal of simplification .
the vote will take place on thursday , 11 november 2010 .
strengthening the osce : a role for the eu ( debate )
it is vital to strengthen them and consolidate their implementation .
the osce should place greater emphasis on action in these area .
this year mark the 35th anniversary of the helsinki conference 's final act .
the helsinki process ha contributed to important historical change in europe .
in many region , there are still conflict between neighbour and ethnic group .
many country have problem with the introduction of civil right and democracy .
the osce 's humanitarian basket , in particular , is unique .
the eu certainly ha a very robust development aid policy .
it is just a strong a the member state want it to be .
this parliament would like to help it to find this dynamism .
new momentum ha been provided for the osce from various side .
however , we also want to take new measure .
that is what is valuable about this motion for a resolution .
in other word , the union must build on this experience .
we know that the situation there is far from satisfactory .
there are many serious human right violation , terrible prison condition , etc .
that summit should not become a mere pr exercise for kazakhstan .
this is what the british call early warning diplomacy .
trade union and social activist are routinely thrown in jail on trumped-up charge .
furthermore , i will not repeat what i said initially in this debate .
many have already raised a number of common issue .
one point in particular wa mentioned : the human right situation in kazakhstan .
rest assured that the european union will assume it responsibility there .
i welcome the initiative to strengthen cooperation between the eu and the osce .
the first one concern strengthening the human aspect of the osce .
legislative power currently lie with the legislative yuan , which ha 113 member .
taiwan is , a we all know , a well-developed and stable democracy .
we need to reinforce regional coherence in south-eastern asia .
this is a very important decision that we are about to take .
that is precisely why we have taken this decision .
we have information exchange system and the facility to deal with any problem .
internationally , taiwan is not generally recognised a a country .
there is another list containing those national who are exempt from that requirement .
however , we also stand to gain from an ideological point of view .
europe stand for openness , a welcoming spirit and inclusivity .
i am now the president of the taiwanese friendship group in this parliament .
again , the benefit of these exchange are substantial in every possible sense .
now there is even talk of abolishing visa for turkey .
( hu ) thank you for the floor , mr president .
i believe that we are paying off our debt .
on the contrary , we should have positive expectation in this respect .
taiwan is a developed country with high technical and administrative standard .
tie are set to grow , to the advantage of both party .
i am sure that it will probably be voted for unanimously tomorrow .
finally , there is another reason , apart from the economic one .
( de ) mr president , taiwan is on the positive list .
however , politics is a question of give and take .
a yet , however , that ha not happened .
i hope that this declaration of intent will also be followed by action .
a always , this ha been done very thoroughly .
thank you very much for a very good debate .
i would also like to thank you for supporting my work .
it is clear that in these agreement , there are winner and loser .
unfortunately , not all of these legitimate expectation are destined to come true .
the people of europe in particular have felt this during the economic crisis .
this situation is very disturbing and requires an explanation .
however , challenge remain and they will have to be confronted .
this is not only in their interest , but in ours a well .
morocco ha largely closed it border to anyone who could witness these event .
no information and no member of parliament are allowed in .
we need to react by parliament making a stand .
the european economic area is world renowned for it technological expertise .
putting up with interruption in this area is not acceptable .
a solution must be found to this a quickly a possible .
the economic crisis ha helped increase the unemployment rate to 10 % .
instead , it wa changed to execution by hanging for alleged murder .
demographic challenge and solidarity between generation ( short presentation )
firstly , a combined package for young and old ha been put together .
it take a new innovative approach based on justice between the generation .
we do not need a uniform european retirement age .
instead , the national pensionable age should be observed .
secondly , early retirement and it financial incentive must be eliminated throughout europe .
at the other end of the age scale are the young people .
the principle of 'supporting and challenging ' need to come into play here .
that is the right signal at the right time .
we can , and we will , bring young and old together .
there should ideally be gradual retirement and voluntary retirement rather than compulsory retirement .
i am going now on my own term ' .
we need innovation in term of the way we employ young people .
these are very positive proposal and i welcome them .
i am pleased that so many of my amendment were adopted in committee .
it is about time older people had the same right a everyone else .
anyone who over-exploits raw material is harming the next generation .
many of them are still languishing on the edge of solvency .
capital pension fund can not be a response to demographic trend .
these include the european youth guarantee initiative and the fifty-plus employment pact initiative .
in our era , these two factor are coming dangerously together .
ensuring intergenerational justice is one of the main objective of european social policy .
the bulk of immigrant create their own social network without integrating into society .
another hidden problem is the social composition of birth .
they therefore often solve their current financial problem through giving birth .
( pt ) demographic change is one of the main challenge facing europe .
in 2050 , it is only expected to make up 5 % .
far-reaching change to the structure of the european population are currently becoming apparent .
this is something that we must pay due attention to in our policy .
the demographic risk involved are a priority for eu-level social policy .
i would like to welcome thomas mann 's report .
new instrument are required to tackle the demographic problem in rural area .
consensus building is vital to justify necessary , yet unpopular reform .
europe is ageing more quickly than the other continent .
at the same time , i urge member state to :
we must not discard their experience or dismiss their desire to continue working .
also of exceptional importance is the 'guaranteeing a decent pension ' initiative .
many people wrongly think that older people have fewer need .
crèches and nursery are , and always will be , a compromise .
implementation of the research framework programme ( short presentation )
programme which have simpler rule will also be more transparent and efficient .
we must simplify the future , but also settle the past .
i have heard a number of story in this regard .
the same applies to application for funding under cultural and educational programme .
we will also work on further reducing delay in providing grant and payment .
only then can we really remove some of the big constraint .
presentation of the court of auditor ' annual report - 2009 ( debate )
those exception are administrative expenditure and economic and financial affair .
that brings me to the court 's third key message .
improving the quality of spending should be a high priority .
earlier this year , the commission presented a draft recast financial regulation .
we do not really need the tolerable risk of error .
i do not believe that this promise is being kept .
your organisation , mr caldeira , provides an essential service for european taxpayer .
however , the commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing .
secondly , we must no longer impose double penalty on taxpayer .
the commission itself ha just made this fact public .
there are still some thing that are in need of improvement .
we are talking here about 80 % of the european budget .
that is , in my view , the path we need to follow .
i am happy to give the commission the credit .
the fact is that taxpayer ' money ha been unlawfully spent .
it is a fact , and even i have to acknowledge that .
will the money be paid back and how big is the amount involved ?
let me give you just two reason for this .
firstly , the national management declaration made are not supported politically .
thirdly , i support the commission and the european court of auditor .
i therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score .
this is especially important in consideration of the discharge of the 2009 budget .
therefore , the billion that you referred to are not accurate amount .
( nl ) madam president , i fully understood that .
in my opinion , however , this is not enough .
administrative expenditure is our expenditure on salary , building and such like .
we need to take another careful look at these control system .
the responsibility for managing the budget lie with the commission .
our task is to work together to avoid these error occurring in future .
we in parliament will , of course , do so .
this is the measure of the progress we have found .
the court is an independent audit institution governed by the treaty .
this is where we have this word of caution .
but we are also assisting you through our special report .
the budget review is also on the table next year .
lastly , i believe that this report ha come too late .
however , the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency .
we have been through some difficult negotiation , especially with the council .
well , this one could not be more different .
it is the typical way in which europe work .
any remaining fund had to be invested in this project .
there were only a few project which could not be implemented .
i would like to thank mr van brempt very warmly .
i would like to thank everyone concerned once again .
it could result in this programme being ineffective in these area .
we welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued .
this is where the budget need to be more flexible .
( de ) i would also like to praise mr oettinger .
i am still wondering if this one billion will be used .
we are getting increasing indication that this project will not work .
why are we , a green , nevertheless voting for this project today ?
we need to leapfrog , especially when it come to building and efficiency .
the basic purpose of these is to ensure diversification of fuel supply .
large amount of this gas are found in france , poland and bulgaria .
the second 'bird ' is europe 's heavy dependence on imported energy .
greece received just 1.5 % of the programme for natural gas pipeline .
i trust that we shall have a fairer distribution in future .
i congratulate the rapporteur and wish for every success in spending the money .
unfortunately , this action ha not been taken at the right time .
i wish to congratulate mr van brempt for her report .
however , there are obvious shortcoming in term of funding .
i thank the rapporteur for her extremely important work .
credit line that are able to complement worthy local initiative are needed .
i would like to thank mr van brempt for her excellent work .
this is not just about mandatory national requirement , but about specific project .
if this is the case , we will have invested the money wisely .
this is something which doe not happen every day .
this mean having direct contact with what is actually happening .
this mean that this is also an experimental laboratory for more budget funding .
with this in mind , i would like to thank you very much .
we have heard some comment and very many good example have been given .
these project bring impressive result in the short term a well .
the statistic show that a growing number of farm are being abandoned .
the commission doe not think that the situation in the sector justifies this .
the price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend .
it is very slightly below last year 's level .
production is currently well absorbed by the internal market and export .
those are the answer i am able to give at this stage .
i would like to thank mr garcía for this initiative .
rule of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural product .
mr cioloş , parliament is ready to give you it full support .
it urged the commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price .
standard of animal welfare should be obligatory and should be improved .
take action to stop this appalling speculation on cereal .
this , in turn , affect roughly 70 % of production cost .
i am therefore pleased by the announcement made by commissioner cioloş today .
the european parliament can not remain indifferent to this situation .
however , this motion proposes solution which we can not support .
around 75 % of our plant protein is imported .
this is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent change .
once again , the small farm have been hit hardest by the crisis .
we ultimately need to do something in this area a well .
i would like mr cioloş to explain what we should think about this .
i wish to raise the issue of the surge in grain price .
the european commission ha done nothing to prevent this .
in addition to this , the cost are also borne by european taxpayer .
fifthly , livestock keeper are forced to make disproportionately large environmental protection investment .
this is particularly serious in the new member state .
this , too , should be addressed and remedied .
( pt ) we are probably on the way to another commodity bubble .
however , the chain , the functioning of the market is more pernicious .
admittedly , this is partly a question of national responsibility .
they are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement .
are you prepared , commissioner , to support that agreement ?
this security should be guaranteed by appropriate decision at eu level .
we must , therefore , promote the cultivation of protein-rich crop .
in 2008 , we had the biggest global production of cereal .
the first one concern the problem of cereal price and intervention stock .
market intervention can not be justified when price are high .
i am working with my colleague , mr barnier , on this issue .
european livestock farmer have been facing ever-growing difficulty recently .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : ireland - sr technics (
request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of mr krzysztof lisek (
mr president , i would like to make an announcement to the house .
consequently , all 27 eu country can enter taiwanese territory without a visa .
i believe that this is a sentence which could gain broad agreement here :
whereas coordinated monetary policy should take a higher priority in the transatlantic partnership .
eu external strategy on passenger name record ( pnr ) (
strengthening the osce : a role for the eu (
( lt ) i voted for this very important document .
however , what is happening about europe 's newest state , kosovo ?
the commission ha still not got under way with this .
it took time for the council to realise this , however .
today , i am pleased that we meps did not give in .
today of all day , he ought to remember that .
there are so many important issue to be discussed .
our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity .
together , our economy account for half of the global economy .
( nl ) mr president , a point of order .
they should be an example to other osce member .
older people must not suffer discrimination because of their age .
mr president , i fully support the mann report .
we must ensure that these people can grow old with dignity .
the only question is how we deal with it .
to invest in innovation , it is necessary to concentrate on subsidising research .
this is particularly important for research institution in the new eu member state .
it is not the size of organisation but scientific progress that creates value .
we need to do it in the whole food chain .
the livestock sector ha also been struck by indirect cause , however .
however , i want to say a couple of thing .
it is therefore necessary to identify suitable budget heading for making these transfer .
for these and other reason , i wholeheartedly support mr matera 's report .
i am abstaining out of respect for the irish worker ill-treated by globalisation .
however , the little which is being given may relieve their hardship .
therefore , i have voted in favour of this report .
however , we are fortunate to have such a resource available to u .
these are financial offence which are illegal under polish law .
the capital requirement will be especially burdensome to pe and venture capital .
venture capital is needed to create new job in start-ups .
the capital requirement will be especially burdensome to pe and venture capital .
venture capital is needed to create new job in start-ups .
this text represents a major step forward in financial regulation .
i should like to congratulate mr gauzès for his outstanding work .
supervisory measure , which need to be mainstreamed , are also important .
indeed , speculative fund have been exposed a having helped exacerbate the crisis .
a a result , the single market will become more transparent and efficient .
the text we have adopted will be revised in four year ' time .
an excellent opportunity to properly regulate the financial market ha been wasted .
we can not , therefore , vote for this proposal .
i voted against this text and the european parliament amendment that it contains .
contrary to it claim , this text regulates nothing .
these were not supervised and often consisted of asset of doubtful value .
i hope that this represents only the first step in this direction .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of this report .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the report .
i voted in favour of parliament 's position a i believe that :
i voted in favour of parliament 's position for those reason .
i should like to congratulate mr gauzès for his excellent work .
it content is really no match for the challenge we have to face .
we shall then lag even further behind in the area of technology .
the european parliament supported the aim of this proposal .
the eu is also the largest foreign investor in taiwan .
in recent decade , taiwan ha undergone many change .
taiwan , today , show high economic growth and low unemployment .
since the 1950s , taiwan ha gone through many successful reform .
in political term , taiwan ha completed a process of far-reaching democratisation .
the eu and taiwan maintain economic and commercial relation on a large scale .
the eu is the biggest foreign investor in taiwan .
taiwan is the eu 's fourth largest trading partner in asia .
there is also cooperation on research and education , culture and the environment .
the number of illegal immigrant to the eu from taiwan are very low .
it is also important to distinguish between the different third country .
the introduction of technical support for implementing these project is welcome .
that is why i voted in favour of this text .
i congratulate the rapporteur for her outstanding work and the encouraging result achieved .
public and private building incorporating renewable energy and/or energy efficiency solution ;
local infrastructure , including efficient lighting of outdoor public infrastructure .
unspent fund from these project may be allocated to this field .
i also hope that the report will not drown in red tape .
improving the energy efficiency and security are major priority for the eu .
this will have a tangible effect if the fund are applied sensibly .
the next eu-united state summit is a crucial juncture in this cooperation .
in writing . - ( lt ) i support this resolution .
the tie that bind the united state and europe are unique and historical .
the people have responded to the choice of exploitation and war with struggle .
i voted against this betrayal of the general interest and democracy .
this relationship remains a major priority for the european union .
our reality is one of ever closer economic integration .
transatlantic relation have always been a crucial part of european foreign policy .
i voted in favour of this resolution , a i believe that :
the relationship linking europe and the united state is unique and historic .
in writing . - i abstained at the final vote .
in writing . - ( lt ) i support this resolution .
freedom is one of the cardinal principle on which this house is based .
there is no question , therefore , a to it importance .
i voted broadly in favour of what this motion for a resolution proposes .
that is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better .
they must be conducted transparently , at eu level .
the available technological mean constitute a significant challenge to respect for individual privacy .
moreover , meps must be allowed to monitor this situation closely .
this resolution completely contradicts the one adopted by this house in may .
it 'welcomes ' the proposal made by the commission in september .
the union will not , however , endanger civil liberty and fundamental right .
more and more country are using passenger data for this purpose .
the information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional case .
i endorse the objective that the commission proposes in it communication .
the need of security and freedom are in a delicate balance .
full advantage must be taken of europe 's innovation potential .
i just hope that the programme will be implemented appropriately .
it is one of the central initiative of the europe 2020 strategy .
therefore , i have voted in favour of this report .
in writing . - ( lt ) i supported this resolution .
no aspect of the eu 's security can be neglected .
in any case , security threat must be tackled across all three dimension .
it is also important not to underestimate the human dimension of osce cooperation .
the eu must also play an important role in this field .
let u not forget the circumstance in which the osce wa established .
it is regrettable that this spirit of helsinki ha dimmed in recent year .
the osce represents a forum for seeking such solution .
however , from an eu perspective , some activity are being duplicated here .
this is why i voted for thomas mann 's report .
in writing . - ( lt ) i support this report .
that is why i decided to vote against the resolution .
therefore , the proposal for the european youth guarantee initiative should be recommended .
moreover , woman of all age often care for young and elderly dependent .
on the one hand , it us very complimentary language about older people .
encouraging an increase in the age at which the pension can be claimed .
tomorrow 's workforce will be made up of today 's young people .
we need to help young people more and support entrepreneurship and youth employment .
moreover , i preferred to abstain during the vote on this report .
these are some of the reason why i voted against this text .
in writing . - ireland 's society is ageing at an unprecedented rate .
that is what it advocate , though , from start to finish .
the european union is faced with an increasingly ageing population .
older employee should be given better opportunity for participating in the labour market .
however , uncontrolled mass immigration into the eu is the wrong approach .
i voted in favour of mr mann 's report .
knowledge , education , training and information have no age limit .
the limit of the intergenerational contract have been reached .
we must also stop the social exclusion of elderly people .
i would like briefly to add another aspect to the discussion .
for this reason , we must combat age discrimination in the workplace .
the demographic crisis is not something we found out about yesterday .
for year , we have been saying that europe is ageing and dying .
now it is upon u and we are frantically looking for a solution .
this is because we are addressing not the cause , but the consequence .
we are looking for new player to expand the base .
despite this , i voted in favour of the submitted report .
in writing . - ( lt ) i voted for this report .
science , education and innovation are pillar of economic growth and job creation .
programme which have simpler rule will also be more transparent and more efficient .
the report give the commission clear guideline and option for simplifying the fp7 .
combating the brain drain must remain a priority for the european union .
the excessively control-oriented funding system for research result in a waste of resource .
my vote in favour of this report is based on three factor .
the first is the connection with my previous activity .
the report aim to simplify procedure and reduce cost .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of this report .
this is truly the challenge for the year ahead .
the current rule are in need of simplification and clarification .
science , education and innovation are pillar of economic growth and job creation .
research and innovation are at the heart of the europe 2020 strategy .
i endorsed the report on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programme .
greater help from the commission is still essential here .
better use should be made of the opportunity presented by fp7 .
this will make europe more competitive and will improve quality of life .
i wa happy to vote in favour of this report .
the role of this parliament should be limited to two area .
the second area is respect for the right of eu member state .
i am in favour of simplifying support for research .
we are probably on the way to another commodity bubble .
in writing . - ( lt ) i voted for this report .
the statistic also bring new issue to everyone 's attention .
inadequate gesture are being made for the livestock farmer ' benefit .
hence the reason i voted in favour of it .
many livestock farm in the european union are in a difficult situation .
the second point is about making agricultural policy simpler and more transparent .
therefore , it is important that they are removed .
i am expecting to see these reflected in the commission 's future activity .
i would like to thank mr herranz for her initiative .
these cause an increase in production cost and consumer then choose cheaper product .
this situation is exacerbating the crisis in bulgaria 's livestock sector .
my vote in favour is aimed at supporting all livestock farmer facing bankruptcy .
agricultural aid already account for nearly 40 % of the total eu budget .
the agricultural sector doe not need any more subsidy .
it devours more than 40 % of the total eu budget .
this must not be repeated in the food sector .
eu livestock production system are important for maintaining livelihood .
wheat and other grain are the principal area of production .
in the eu-27 , there are more than 130 million livestock unit .
such fluctuation may cause serious disturbance in the livestock sector .
that ban need to remain in place for two reason .

however , she wa unable to collect it in person 20 year ago .
it is estimated that 8 000 girl fall victim to this every day .
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
there will be a vote , but no debate .
i would like to make two comment on this .
firstly , we should leave these report on the agenda .
the fact are undeniable and are plain to see .
knowing all this , we can not simply ignore it .
i personally consider that a more proper way to proceed .
i repeat : the vote will take place on thursday .
this can also be proposed to the conference of president .
the next item is the joint debate on the following :
the commission statement on the latest development on international currency exchange rate .
further measure to stimulate the economy also contributed to the level of debt .
however , they constrained the capacity of the government to act .
in my view , this danger ha not yet been averted .
the principle of the stability and growth pact were infringed .
these infringement must now be removed and new infringement must be prevented .
this crisis therefore also represents an opportunity that we should exploit .
this is therefore the second time i have addressed parliament this year .
mr president , let me first mention the action taken during the crisis .
2009 wa a most challenging year for the ecb 's monetary policy .
this brought our main refinancing rate to 1 % .
these were , of course , decision of extreme importance .
to this end , we introduced our security market programme .
the ecb used to say that this is no time for complacency .
you can trust that we will deliver what our fellow citizen expect .
the commission welcome the report , which reflects the key issue appropriately .
an agreement had been reached to work on indicative guideline .
why do i say that in this way today ?
you know you have parliament 's support : you said so yourself .
the single currency should be supplemented with fiscal tightening and joint long-term debt .
the reckless behaviour of financial operator helped trigger the economic and financial crisis .
at the weekend , we saw once again where that lead u .
the european central bank must share the responsibility for this drama .
introduce eurobonds before the speculator claim their next victim .
i can not give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now .
yet any realist know that this will not happen .
a single currency only work in a tight-knit federal environment .
history will show u whether it wa really such a good idea .
just why is so much pressure being piled on at present ?
the leman brother solution can not always be the answer .
what is more , the economy needed to be revived .
european solidarity is being shown with difficulty and sparingly .
the tax situation in the united state is worse than that in europe .
on top of federal public deficit , there are enormous private deficit .
forty-eight of the 50 state in the american union have a deficit budget .
mr van rompuy spoke about the euro struggling to survive .
we have the most solvent internal market in the world .
the union is the main destination for third-country direct investment .
company in the union hold the biggest investment stock worldwide .
but these people are wrong and they live in the past .
the establishment of the european emergency fund is no structural solution .
fortunately , mr balz 's report is very clear on that point .
cutback are needed if we are to overcome the crisis .
no citizen will understand parliament wanting still more and wanting further compromise .
and to put thing right in ireland , two thing are necessary .
i have a very specific question for you both .
it show that we were right - the euro can not work ' .
this is , of course , an erroneous claim .
i will therefore ask you two gentleman a question .
is it because the euro area and the common currency have problem ?
madam president , i would like to put a question to mr trichet .
but worst of all , they joined the european single currency .
but we are in a situation where we need solidarity .
we are all very much interlinked : let u not forget that .
lastly , there is political instability this evening in ireland .
we need to help ireland , not punish it .
this task , too , you have performed very professionally and convincingly .
both are important task , and we can not afford to neglect either .
any talk of deconstruction of the european project is irresponsible .
we are independent to deliver price stability to 330 million fellow citizen .
so i have to remind all of you of that .
but again , our message is very clear on that .
now let me turn for just one minute to the issue of communication .
we have , of course , to permanently improve our communication .
so we try to be a accountable in term of communication a possible .
now there were a number of very important question .
now let me only say that i also noted the important question ...
if thing go wrong , it is europe 's fault .
therefore , let u beware of the scapegoat phenomenon .
thank you very much for your detailed answer , mr trichet .
the first is the independence of the european central bank .
the european central bank is the guardian of the euro .
a far a i am concerned , that is a very important point .
this is another thing that i would certainly emphasise .
enlargement must continue , with the prerequisite of meeting the maastricht criterion .
in writing . - i welcome and support this report .
a a result , we have high and rising unemployment .
unemployment will rise , and our economic performance will stagnate .
this system diminishes business ' efficiency and also restricts their effectiveness between border .
these bear a seriously negative impact on the member state ' income .
the proposal ha indeed already been discussed in the council working party .
we must also consider the need to prevent and combat fraud .
combating fraud and easing burden on smes are red herring .
vat harmonisation is about centralisation and the consolidation of eu power .
for this reason , european business have been put at a disadvantage .
we also want to see a more effective internal market .
today , we did not discus what solution are required .
sale tax is therefore at least a important a direct tax .
the next item is the commission statement on urgent aid to haiti .
the number of people admitted to hospital come to more than 20 000 .
but it is feared that these figure are severely underestimated .
the epidemic is spreading at an alarming rate in the capital , port-au-prince .
another offer from austria ha just entered the pipeline .
eu support can be channelled through the eu civil protection mechanism .
the earthquake in haiti demonstrated the almost total incompetence of the local authority .
haiti need a state which can do something for it poor .
indeed , ngo risk no longer being able to accomplish their mission .
this is certainly not an answer , but it is an explanation .
the haitian revolution ha never managed to enter the history book .
this is not a terribly hard disease to cure .
the united nation peacekeeper have been accused of spreading this contagion .
humanitarian worker have also felt threatened and many are leaving the country .
i say this to all member of this house .
the even greater tragedy now is this cholera epidemic .
mr president , this is a tragedy that doe not bear talking about .
military helicopter came to lift heavy piece of masonry that had fallen down .
commissioner georgieva ha been trying hard to coordinate the activity .
why is the united nation now being asked to disappear ?
when are they going to ask the eu to disappear ?
the outbreak of another epidemic in haiti wa to be expected .
we have spoken often about the situation prevailing in haiti before the earthquake .
we know that you will be present at every emergency .
what is it then that they are relying on u to do ?
of course , prevention and clean drinking water are the priority .
however , the situation requires an urgent and much stronger response .
however , this is about our fellow human being , our fellow creature .
we also have to call on the member state to provide in-kind assistance .
the pledge made by the commission ha been honoured .
the haitian authority prefer to stick to the timetable .
it is difficult for me to give an answer .
one member spoke about the haitian people being very resilient .
τhe next item is the joint debate on the following report :
commissioner , this initiative wa tabled by the commission in july 2009 .
the spanish presidency had no agreement and no possibility of a trialogue .
i asked the new presidency whether it wa willing to continue negotiation .
they told me not to be impatient , not to hurry .
the second amendment refers to the inclusion of live bait in the tac .
finally , the third amendment refers to the review of catch .
i would like some clear answer on these issue .
we have been working for 14 month and all we have is confusion .
or at least win back the credibility you have lost since september 2009 !
your action do not match up to 21st century leadership .
this is how the european project must move forward .
egg survey for horse mackerel have been conducted every three year since 1997 .
this is one stock which cover the entire geographical area .
we could not agree to the splitting of a single fishery stock .
but let u keep the policy a it is .
once again , i would like to express my very sincere thanks .
this must result in sustainable and more efficient management of marine resource .
it wa reopened in january 2010 , just five year later .
last july , scientist confirmed that the stock wa safely above precautionary limit .
this amendment change the four-hour rule which is in the new control regulation .
the figure of 5 000 tonne is simply not science-based .
i will turn now to the third report on the baltic technical measure .
once again , i thank the committee on fishery for fully supporting it .
we considered it opportune to carry out this alignment a proposed by parliament .
we have before u the revised common fishery policy .
however , caution won out against game of chance in committee .
counting fish is not difficult ; it is like counting tree .
it is just that fish move around and they are not visible .
there are also issue affecting vessel in the north sea .
i had a meeting with fisherman from whitby in yorkshire on friday .
all fish that have been caught and will not survive must be landed .
high grading is a response to the unfair quota system .
it is very important that we make a distinction here .
( e ) mr president , commissioner , congratulation to the four rapporteur .
this is the sector that ha suffered the greatest damage .
it is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further .
it is essential that article 15a is included in the regulation .
i assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow .
a number of speaker have again referred to the scandal of discard .
this plan will allow for joint management measure between the main fishing country .
moreover , i welcome the measure for supervising control of this fishery .
i would like to congratulate mr gallagher on his report .
my group , the ppe group , ha a different view .
this make an annual total upwards of gbp 11.1 billion .
over 880 000 dead fish are dumped into the north sea every year .
this plan is supported by the sector , which need stability .
so we have to find a solution to unblock the situation .
we can not throw fish back in the sea .
we have to reduce the burden which create obstacle in aquaculture .
we have lived for many year with this lack of transparency .
i would , however , like a clearer answer , commissioner .
i will certainly be recommending that we support that amendment .
multiannual plan are vital to allow the sector to plan forward .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 23 november 2010 ) .
it is not only a question of willingness to compromise .
no one should ever receive unsolicited information on medicinal product .
there are point on which we do not agree .
we have succeeded in reaching agreement on this matter .
that is not something that we want to encounter .
patient are highly interested in their own health and wellbeing .
again , i applaud parliament for taking exactly this stance .
several of parliament 's amendment concern information from source other than industry source .
therefore , any change regarding this issue would be premature .
it is neither appropriate nor necessary to restate this .
where and how is it possible to obtain objective and unbiased information ?
the ema ha a vital role a the preferred source of objective information .
i feel that the key word here are 'patient oriented ' .
it is very important ; action need to be taken quickly .
neither the public nor the member state stand to gain from this move .
information must not be freely distributed by pharmaceutical company .
therefore , information about prescription medicine should be regulated strictly .
we should open the door fully to all information that is requested .
we agreed to reject the commercial campaign mounted by the pharmaceutical company .
( de ) madam president , the wellbeing of patient is key here .
the font size should be increased , particularly for older people .
i believe that there are two particularly important point in the directive .
our task , however , is to provide information .
how often do we wish for more information on product and illness ?
this wa achieved by a ban on direct consumer advertising for prescription-only medicine .
the distinction between information and advertising is becoming le clear .
accessibility of information will undoubtedly play a fundamental role in this change .
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work .
i base my position on the idea that patient are responsible people .
i would like to focus on two key point .
we must therefore counter this with an alternative : controlled information .
i consider this to be a very , very important matter .
i say this especially because we have been waiting year for this text .
that , in fact , is what make it different from advertising .
quality information is very important and contributes to improved healthcare condition .
what we need is not only harmonisation of european regulation .
pharmaceutical company also play an important role in this .
other information channel should only serve to supplement that information .
the posting of this information on website must be transparent and independent .
the motion stress the difference between advertising and information .
the provision of information is based on the principle of active research .
doctor must continue to be the main source of information on medicinal product .
this often doe not happen in the best possible way .
they are prescribed today with no review of the case for a year .
i have been following the debate in parliament very assiduously .
i would like to make some short comment on what you have said .
it is somewhat more difficult in the case of disease .
commission 's position on the amendment tabled by the parliament :
not acceptable : 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 and 11
i believe that the commission and parliament are now in agreement .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 24 november 2010 .
in writing . - information regarding consumer product ha become essential .
one important distinction which ha to be made is between information and advertisement .
one important element which is not being addressed is information on price .
the difference in price is not minimal but unbelievable .
undoubtedly , this initiative is praiseworthy and i support it .
i believe that in drawing up new regulation , reality must be considered .
extreme ban and restrictive regulatory measure on tobacco should be treated with caution .
healthcare professional remain the most trusted source of information about medicine .
it is a very complex waste stream that includes several hazardous substance .
nanomaterials will be looked at specifically in future review of restriction .
this will give u a much clearer picture for the future debate .
a computer , for example , contains over 60 raw material .
therefore , it is important that this law be clarified and streamlined .
the commission would therefore like to clarify the issue by making two statement .
we would also like to make the following declaration a regard nanomaterials .
i would encourage parliament to adopt the same position .
annex 3 ha been dropped , which we regret .
i will simply say that solar panel were highly controversial .
that is something we will have to watch carefully .
naturally , i would also like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur .
we expanded it scope , only to restrict it again straight away .
this seems to be the case for enterprise in the renewable energy sector .
by definition , i think that is what a recast should do .
it wa intended to simplify the requirement and demand on manufacturer .
secondly , it wa intended to create legal certainty .
i have to mention the opening of the scope here .
finally , i would also like to mention the real danger of over-regulation .
i look forward to the commission taking this point on board .
one major success of the new version is the open scope .
it is the poor of this world that will suffer a a result .
the poor can not afford to pay for lobbyist in the european union .
( de ) madam president , our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur .
the directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial .
there were great difference of opinion regarding various aspect .
i must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective .
( nl ) madam president , let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur .
naturally , action is also being taken on nanomaterials .
yes , of course , we are unhappy with some aspect .
the issue at stake here are innovation and investment .
indeed , we need to consider these question separately .
now , sulphur is not something i would readily choose to ingest .
however , thing are quite different when we are dealing with chemical compound .
i am satisfied with the version now before u .
the rohs directive is a key element of this policy .
at least the tabled amendment manages to encompass all the exception foreseen .
the result is something that the majority of u can support .
the commission ha a lot to say on this issue .
so this is not the end of our work .
i would like to thank you all for your contribution and your suggestion .
there is also plenty of evidence of the need for future restriction .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 24 november 2010 .
it is estimated that such waste will reach 12.3 million tonne by 2020 .
renewables have the aim of helping to protect the environment .
i would like to express my fundamental opposition to amendment no 12 .
this proposal excludes photovoltaic panel from the scope of the rohs directive .
the commission 's original proposal wa tailored far too much to large enterprise .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
romania is not , nor will it be , an exporter of crime .
this is crucial if we are to be efficient and make saving .
i should like to call for an in-depth debate on this subject .
the not-fit-for-purpose single currency , founded upon idealistic ideology and not economic sense .
the old adage about putting all your egg in one basket ring true .
spiegel online writes 'the celtic tiger ha been taken into intensive care ' .
we need to ask why is this the case ?
private commercial bank pump incredible amount of money into the system .
we need to return the generation of money to the public sector .
this would enable u to pour hundred of billion back into european economy .
however , such massive decision would require courage and strength from our politician .
only 33 % of young people do not want to leave romania .
even with private security , these boat are very vulnerable .
they report their position and no one intercept them .
we do not know how they respond to these alert .
a few hour after i reported these detail , the exhibition wa reopened .
in december 1989 , a few major thrill-seekers awoke dracula from his slumber .
now we do not know how to get rid of him .
it is a sign that we can not ignore .
this is unquestionably an extremely complex problem which will be hard to resolve .
so there is a real divergence between those two set of view .
meanwhile , mr litvinenko 's dignified widow , marina , is denied justice .
mr litvinenko wa a british citizen murdered on british soil .
macedonia is a country where reform are bringing good result .
they start to learn english from the age of six .
we can talk about the unresolved issue during the negotiation process .
a failure to do this will undermine confidence in europe .
the european commission therefore ha a duty to take up this matter .
the election are between the democratic and communist force .
the democratic force must stand together both before and after the election .
there must be no repeat of the violent event of april 2009 .
democratic government are not established through fraud , violence or fear .
however , we in this parliament support those bringing about democratic change .
for how long will western democracy collude with this by remaining silent ?
fortunately , president buzek ha made a statement on behalf of parliament .
what is the point of the alliance of civilisation ?
it ha received over eur 30 million for over 400 successful european project .
orphan work are work for which the copyright owner can not be found .
last week , i organised a debate in parliament on this topic .
however , the process is still shrouded in secrecy .
around 40 % of our artistic output in europe is affected by orphanhood .
democratic participation can not be allowed to stop at the factory gate .
a hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sow the seed of social unrest .
the first round passed off quite well on 31 october .
temper therefore need to cool down so that voting can take place normally .
it is extremely important to protect our observer until sunday and beyond .
that includes a clearly defined remit and funding for public broadcasting .
that is why we want to introduce the role of medium pluralism monitor .
that , commissioner , is a tool developed on the commission 's initiative .
that , of course , would be completely undesirable .
however , member state are not disciplined in the way they implement it .
we also have the incomplete harmonisation of copyright law .
this problem is dealt with by item 33 of the report .
the medium environment definitely varies between the individual country .
we have some comment on two element of the report in particular .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 november 2010 .
civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capability ( short presentation )
we have made specific proposal for the training of civil and military personnel .
one example of this is the european policing troop .
we have made proposal for the future of the battle group .
we are calling for a new approach to this issue .
military and civil information ha already been collated here .
the situation centre is now to move to the external action service .
i do not believe that this is in any way acceptable .
i would like to express my clear opposition to such action .
there can be little doubt that they run contrary to the european spirit .
what my fellow member say is simply a lie .
you have not denied that this wa indeed the case .
i would like to thank mr ehrenhauser for his contribution .
a everyone know , this wa not possible before .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 23 november 2010 .
unfortunately , many aspect relating thereto remain at the planning stage .
i shall begin with some very sad information regarding the flood in europe .
yet again this year , europe ha been hit by a flood disaster .
they deserve the thanks and appreciation of our institution .
in central europe , summer flood are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating .
it is vital to prevent , research and properly manage the risk .
mr president , you have spoken about the solidarity fund .
mr president , of course , our first sympathy lie with the victim .
our first thought go out to them , of course .
we also need to consult them about preventative measure .
how can we prevent such a disaster happening again ?
this provision doe not just apply to flood zone .
we should therefore strengthen all agri-environmental measure along these line .
it is about what you do when you get the warning .
all the group in parliament are in agreement on this .
we also agree that we must provide aid quickly .
a lot of sensible thing have already been said .
how better to prove that europe is here for it citizen ?
ten year later , we can conclude that progress ha been made .
the european union is firmly committed to implementing resolution 1325 and subsequent resolution .
the first report is being finalised a we speak .
this disgrace to humanity , these war crime , must stop .
strict sanction need to be imposed on everyone involved in such practice .
training , control , discipline and a clear message are needed .
the gender perspective ha definitely become more important at an international level .
mr president , woman and child are victim in war and conflict situation .
woman have now been recognised a victim , and indeed they are victim .
they play an active part in the reconstruction of the country .
rape is a widespread , systematic and organised practice .
we must , of course , condemn this violence .
i believe that we are sorely lacking in political ambition and adequate fund .
moreover , 10 member state now have a national action plan .
however , abuse of woman is often still a major characteristic of conflict .
many were ostracised even after the conflict wa over .
unfortunately , this ha yet to happen in many case .
i firmly believe there is a real chance that we can change thing .
woman should participate in the entire process of preventing and resolving conflict .
madam president , i want to give my support to resolution 1325 .
this go hand in hand with specific training activity .
many of you have spoken on this issue too .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 november , at 12:00 .
over the year , the traditional role of peace mission ha changed .
state aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mine ( debate )
the impact assessment that you have presented is very good .
i wonder how the college of commissioner picked the year , for example .
there is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment .
however , it may be that they have also not understood the content .
it wa not a phasing out arrangement , it wa a successor arrangement .
the second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability .
imported coal emits just the same amount of co2 a domestic coal .
europe is a leader in this area and ha an export advantage .
i do not believe that we should just give this up .
the cost have to be paid out of the public purse .
therefore , this argument also doe not hold water .
this is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible .
i would like to discus three point that are considered in the report .
the mine were subsidised in the vain hope of achieving profitability .
article 3 ( 1 ) of our proposal mention this point .
the question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline .
we also recommended extending the deadline for closing uncompetitive mine .
our climate footprint is largely the same in both case .
our group will give mr rapkay 's report it unrestricted support .
madam president , this is not a straightforward matter .
it is therefore important for u in parliament to establish a well-balanced position .
there are two main aspect to take into consideration .
so far , the debate ha focused on three issue .
secondly , an end date for the closure aid ha been discussed .
i can be flexible when it come to the exact year .
we are talking about the seventh extension of the special state aid regime .
mr rapkay himself ha indicated that he wa rapporteur back in 2002 .
so they should vote in order to state their view .
we are not negotiating ; we do not have to compromise .
we must remember that aid for uncompetitive coal mine go against these objective .
what is more , he make no secret of it !
meanwhile , the world is changing , and changing fast .
we must remember that the world coal market is changing before our eye .
demand for coal , and the price of coal , are rising .
many miner work in the pit for their entire life .
this is why i think that we can find common ground with 2018 .
moreover , i would like to ask you : what is competitive coal ?
is this the model that many of you want for europe ?
do you reject this same idea for european coal ?
they are uncompetitive due to their obsolete technical equipment .
state aid would allow these facility to be retrofitted to ensure job security .
it is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here .
there are a number of good ground for this decision .
nevertheless , the member state which are affected have been making plan .
however , i can see that regulatory policy is the winner here .
above all , we need to achieve pollution-free extraction soon .
let u maintain our mining sector by taking advantage of new technology .
moreover , european coal is coal that can be clean .
we should also prevent import of subsidised coal from abroad .
thirdly , we should prevent any interference from lobbyist .
it is absolutely imperative to have plan for professional retraining and socio-economic recovery .
we are in a global recession and the european union is in crisis .
finally , the 21st century economy ha been mentioned .
in this respect , i congratulate the rapporteur , mr rapkay .
a some of you have recalled , it date back a long way .
we need to take into account two additional issue .
these are not , however , the only issue that should be considered .
madam president , mr almunia , that is exactly the problem .
i would like to make a second remark to mr chatzimarkakis .
the review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case .
he should have stayed here , because he might have learned something .
now , 20 year later , the figure is around 20 000 .
let u not behave a if nothing ha happened .
i can only say , yes , we do need one .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
i know that all these are argument for and against this measure .
we are dealing , today , with a brutal violation of those principle .
furthermore , they do not have to be profitable at any price .
there are several argument against such a rapid discontinuation of subsidy .
i refer primarily to social and economic consequence on a regional scale .
globalisation mean that there will be significant price pressure on coal .
unprofitable production should not be kept on a life support machine forever .
therefore , abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate .
mobilisation of the eu solidarity fund : ireland - flood in november 2009 (
this is a grave insult to the netherlands a a member state .
no one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda .
that is the question i am going to ask on thursday morning .
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : drenthe division 18/netherlands (
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : limburg division 18/netherlands (

this is not president saakashvili 's first visit to the european parliament .
so it is a special place for mr saakashvili .
the last seven year have not been easy for georgia .
i am sure this enthusiasm is no le today than four year ago .
today , georgia is again at a stage of rapid economic growth .
hopefully , i will perform better this time than last time .
allow me to quote the great poet in his own language :
they did more than overthrow a corrupt , backward-looking regime .
they triggered what economist in london some week ago called a mental revolution .
to sum up : václav havel and slobodan milošević .
only a mental revolution could lead to the european transformation of our society .
this is the message that we georgian brought to this region .
some extremist were using the weakness of the state to reject minority .
our first task wa therefore to embrace multiculturalism and difference .
the soviet union had another characteristic - absolute centralisation .
the vision that guided all these step wa captured by a single symbol .
you can only learn this from your own success and failure .
they see it , judge it and criticise it a a european democracy .
we are aware that democracy are always a work in progress .
of course , our alternative democratic model wa not welcomed by everybody .
they imposed a full-scale embargo on my nation in 2006 .
before that , there wa a full-scale energy embargo in 2005 .
we are building , in these circumstance , democracy at gunpoint .
in 2008 , it once again witnessed total destruction .
it constitutes and expands our policy of constructive unilateralism .
i am ready for deep , comprehensive dialogue with my russian counterpart .
but we need political dialogue to start a well .
because if this is not a military occupation , then what is it ?
if you do not speak out the truth , then who will ?
no one , in short , is going back to the ussr .
lady and gentleman , our region ha made a choice .
russia offered u the chance to go back and have military life .
this will give u a real control over our economic environment ' .
believe me , i am not gloating for the sake of it .
we must therefore learn a lesson from the situation .
there are still flaw in the system at the moment .
the lack of suitable fishing ground is a threat to food security .
( fi ) mr president , i voted in favour of this report .
the reduction in fish stock is currently a major cause for concern .
in other word , the old system wa being sanctioned .
the scope of this debate should now be widened .
i therefore lent my full support to the report by mr ferreira .
we should be supporting the acquisition of renewable energy and it production .
i formally corrected it , but i also wanted to say so here .
it is essential to actively involve these parliament in preparing national development strategy .
i voted to provide fund from the eu solidarity fund to ireland .
many of these request did not receive any support .
under the eu solidarity fund , ireland will receive eur 13 million .
i voted in favour of the mobilisation of the european solidarity fund .
in recent year , we have seen an increasing number of environmental disaster .
i have voted in favour of providing this support .
this is the first proposal to mobilise the fund in 2010 .
this proposal is the first proposal to mobilise the solidarity fund in 2010 .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
altogether , more than 3 000 worker have been made redundant .
these are measure that also combat the relocation of company .
the european globalisation fund wa created to help mitigate such unfortunate event .
now , the approval of the budget authority is required .
my vote could not be anything else but in favour .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
only , in today 's sitting , we are approving six allocation .
fortunately , however , we have this resource available to u .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
in this case , there were 720 redundancy in 79 enterprise .
the awarded support could be a step towards this .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
each one of these worker wa a victim of globalisation .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
it is time dutch politics returned to their root .
that is why i am in favour of this proposal .
the german alcohol monopoly a a concept is to be phased out .
the farmer affected have prepared for the opening up of the market .
for this reason , i support an extension of the arrangement .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
however , there were no pressing ground for doing so .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting .
the proposal sends out a strong signal to the market .
the intended date of implementation is 1 january 2011 .
the trade in pharmaceutical product is an important part of world trade .
i therefore commend the work done and confirm my vote in favour .
the review became necessary both to include new product and remove others .
i therefore hope that this renewal will bear fruit for both party .
at last , it ha a president capable of taking decision .
i support mr yanukovych 's inclination to bring order to ukraine .
in writing . - very easy vote , this one .
we simply had to agree , and we did .
i voted for this report which approves the proposal .
this make cooperation in science and technology even more important .
instead , they have created a single economic area with iceland .
this is a great step forward on the part of the european union .
japan is a role model in the field of technological development .
all of this will accelerate the search for alternative .
in this case , the eu fund will directly benefit those affected .
the country is also well integrated into international and regional scientific network .
i voted for this report , which approves the agreement .
jordan ha a large network of university and research centre .
the eu currently ha 16 fishery partnership agreement ( fpas ) in force .
the treaty of lisbon ha given parliament increased power regarding fpas .
therefore , the proposal will have no consequence in term of tax rate .
it is increasingly evident that tax policy are not neutral .
only then can we reckon on success in fiscal policy .
i consider that the european commission 's initiative is timely .
however , we must oppose these move towards harmonisation .
all of this is also an expression of europe 's historical development .
there are some approach in this area which are worthy of further discussion .
this put european business , and especially smes , at a disadvantage .
i voted for the report for the reason given above .
obviously , i have voted in favour of mr casa 's report .
however , this is no reason why we should not keep on trying .
i would like to encourage the competent commissioner to tackle this difficult dossier .
therefore , the esrb must be given greater power .
i greatly appreciate the effort of the european central bank .
an enlarged monetary union requires , in fact , greater internal cohesion .
i voted for the annual ecb report for 2009 .
however , liquidity ha not always been passed on to the real economy .
the international financial system really is amoral and immoral .
privatisation of profit and public ownership of large-scale loss ...
in the crisis of 2009 , the ecb acted and reacted effectively .
our most important proposal for improvement should be put into practice consistently .
unfortunately , the situation ha not changed since then .
the ecb must oppose any effort to make it into a political body .
the ever-increasing interdependence between internal and external security is becoming clear .
the distinction between the strategic and operational dimension is still vague at present .
fortunately , the day of arm race are now over .
nonetheless , the principle that inspired the latin phrase is still relevant today .
i particularly welcome cooperation on humanitarian crisis and natural disaster .
the report describes in great detail the current development in security policy .
for all these reason , we voted against the resolution .
the anchovy fishery in the bay of biscay is of great socio-economic importance .
i succeeded in modifying those amendment in the final vote .
nevertheless , these estimate must be used to establish the total allowable catch .
i am therefore voting in favour of this report .
i therefore agree with the prohibition and restriction adopted here .
increasing number of fish specie in the baltic sea are under immediate threat .
due to low pay , such work is unattractive to young people .
for these reason , i voted for this report .
i therefore hope that there will be strong encouragement to bring this about .
the main stumbling block wa the cut-off date for that state aid .
2014 would therefore seem to be a reasonable cut-off date .
the mining sector provides 100 000 job in the european union .
it also aim to minimise distortion of competition on the internal market .
without this amendment , the period would have expired on 31 december 2010 .
coal remains an essential part of the global energy mix .
however , we also need alternative solution on the labour market .
there is now more security for 100 000 job throughout europe .
this is all about taking a responsible approach to a traditional european industry .
unfortunately , this amendment did not receive the required majority .
the deadline which resulted from the majority vote wa 31 december 2018 .
it seemed to me reasonable to support his proposal .
measure should not be taken if they exacerbate the crisis .
however , the commission 's proposal doe not go far enough .
domestic coal is much more environmentally friendly than imported coal .
the deadline proposed by the european commission is too close and unrealistic .
only by converting those type of plant will emission be reduced .
measure should not be taken if they exacerbate the crisis .
the european commission ha proposed a scheduled end of subsidy in october 2014 .
coal mining in europe is not efficient , and ha to be subsidised .
every method of producing electricity ha it plus and minus .
the state should not use taxpayer ' money to support non-functioning enterprise .
some of them may become competitive if they are given time to transform .
the report of mr rapkay want to make this possible for them .
i come from the prievidza region , which ha a strong mining tradition .
this is a serious error , the correction of which is important .
the question we should analyse in more detail concern the jpa regional meeting .
there is no doubt that these meeting are necessary .
this is precisely why we should deal with this matter .
we need to help these state to help themselves .
it must be possible for them gradually to develop a functioning national economy .
the ability to feed themselves play a major role in this context .
in europe , 20 % of divorce concern international couple .
the possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain .
the commission action plan is a consistent embodiment of the stockholm programme .
they are exclusively a matter for the member state .
therefore , i have voted against this own-initiative report .
the aim of the stockholm programme and it implementation plan are positive .
trust in member state ' system can be improved by learning about them .
student must be sensitised to participate in foreign exchange programme .
legislation on consumer and enterprise should indeed be for them and about them .
the programme offer advantage and greater transparency to citizen .
unless these proposal are adopted , i will vote against the submitted report .
i am deeply concerned regarding today 's event on the korean peninsula .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the debate on the 2011 budget .
the european parliament is aware of the need to make saving .
this is important , because the treaty of lisbon is in force .
we did not want to go beyond the treaty in any way .
we know that the majority of member state wanted this agreement .
this is the responsibility of all three european institution .
i am sure that an agreement is within reach .
we think the european commission could adopt a decisive role in this matter .
no , it is about ensuring that europe can honour it commitment .
is this a way of reconciling our citizen with europe ?
i may be wrong , but the suspicion is there .
if not money , then what is it all about ?
it is about the right of the european parliament .
it is about the right which are laid down in the treaty .
everything that parliament is calling for form part of the treaty .
the head of government of the european union are all parliamentarian .
the 27 government of the european union are executive .
parliament enacts the budget and parliament control the executive .
parliament must not allow it right to be taken away .
it must then be controlled by parliament within the union .
we have talked about this over the last few hour .
however , we must not now give up this line .
that is the unanimous line taken by my group .
it act on behalf of nation , whose government are elected .
in european democracy , government are elected via a democratic , electoral system .
mr president , there are many interpretation , mr morvai .
on the figure , let u be very clear .
what is more is that flexibility is an 'acquis ' .
it form part of the interinstitutional agreement that we have already .
own resource is also not a question of new competence .
so i have one request to you mr barroso .
ireland symbolises the failure of neoliberalism ; it symbolises the failure of deregulation .
it is cry 'mummy , mummy , europe , help u ! '
i think mr wathelet is working very hard on this .
( replying to a blue card question under rule 149 ( 8 ) )
we have nation state with their own policy and we discus policy .
green also participated in this to make it wrong .
the others who are responsible are the european bank .
the codecision of parliament on all budgetary question is a democratic minimum standard .
in recent year , my group ha rejected the eu budget .
( de ) mr president , i have a question for mr bisky .
it ha to do with product , but in a quite different sense .
but this , i fear , will never happen .
there will always be a way not to succeed .
however , i have heard both institution express a desire to succeed .
this is the context in which we are working at the moment .
there remains a third topic that you have also mentioned : political declaration .
it will fix the level of payment with an increase of 2.91 % .
the budget must reflect the union 's revised priority arising from the treaty .
this tool is therefore too important to be jeopardised .
europe need the european union to have a budget .
it is a budget for the region of europe .
it is a budget for the people of europe .
they are not simply uncertainty ; they are real loss for real citizen .
i must say that what ha been said represents a step backwards .
it is le than what we have so far heard from the council .
i would like to thank you , mr barroso .
the member of the european parliament do not come from mar .
how will we put our shared ambition into practice ?
we accepted the 2.91 % increase in payment appropriation .
this issue of flexibility is a very tangible one .
the eu 's own resource are to be reformed again .
this wa laid down in 2006 in the interinstitutional agreement .
all we want is for this to be confirmed again .
if we do that , we will already be admitting defeat .
therefore , we must not give in at too early a stage .
in fact , the european left is interested in discussing own resource .
( fi ) mr president , we really have an excellent situation now .
the european union is in crisis ; all it institution are in crisis .
that is the situation we sought , and that is the truth .
is mr daul now going to call for sanction against other member state ?
so why do we not create a flexible budget ?
some say that political issue must not be linked to budgetary one .
the history of the entire european union ha been about this .
it can not go on like this any longer !
we do not accept that single-minded austerity is the way out .
we must find an open and constructive procedure on the next financial framework .
that is the political message that we have for the council today .
well then , there are plenty of opportunity for making serious saving .
the union no longer ha the necessary resource to finance it budget .
the treaty of lisbon ha been in force for one year now .
the same is also true for the europe 2020 action programme .
europe , the european vision and european benchmarking can help u spend le .
mr president , i would like to stress three thing .
i believe that we need a budget , one hundred percent .
i think that we will then make it a success .
the european parliament can not pretend to be immune from this .
mr president , i welcome this debate on the budget today .
an eu tax is out of the question in my view .
on the contrary , we should , now , intensify them .
( applause ) mr barroso , i welcome your statement .
there ha obviously been some movement in this area .
the treaty state that this debate must take place .
parliament doe not wish to go beyond it remit .
the new responsibility under the treaty and the 2020 strategy require funding .
i believe that we have a duty to reach an agreement .
we must not allow confidence to wane in europe 's institution .
i believe that parliament 's position during the negotiation wa responsible and moderate .
these change in fact strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the union 's institution .
these farmer are facing financial difficulty and income shortage .
in for a penny , in for a pound .
ceterum censeo there is a need for the european union .
here we have the paradox of not finding common ground on the budget .
the current economic and financial crisis is structural and not a passing phenomenon .
this mean that we were completely in line with the council 's wish .
instead , we are calling for compliance with the treaty .
i think that the belgian presidency is acting on the same assumption .
we see the frustration of million of beneficiary throughout the european union .
the credibility of the european union is at stake .
we need to see progress on the part of the council .
is it possible to move forward in our direction ?
it is very important for u to have such an answer from you .
i think that the citizen of europe deserve better than that .
we hope that the result will be positive a soon a possible .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 november 2010 .
we need to address issue which concern european citizen responsibly .
we can not afford to give in to national egoism .
presentation of the commission work programme for 2011 ( debate )
long-term growth must be based on a sound macro-economic foundation .
in 2011 , the commission will table the remaining piece of regulation .
when competitor are cheaper , we must be smarter .
a particular focus in 2011 will be on energy efficiency .
our company should focus on business , not bureaucracy .
this is a european union at the service of the citizen .
we will also modernise our development policy and humanitarian aid .
meanwhile , these activity remain an important part of our core business .
we need to find way to collectively accelerate our work .
i believe the european union institution should respond to citizen ' concern .
the commission 's earlier work programme were only partially realised according to plan .
i will come back to this point later on .
we must emerge from this crisis with an active growth policy in place .
the concept of the internal market must be made public .
you have proposed several report based on professor monti 's work .
we believe that the proposal made in this area are too weak .
i believe that we need to make progress in this area .
finally , you have spoken about citizen ' concern , mr barroso .
we must work together to explain what we do more effectively .
it opponent will exploit it and use it against europe .
because wanting to be the best is not sufficient to be the best .
the only reasonable way to achieve this is through the single market .
do we need more regulation to tackle the financial crisis ?
yes , but only if the aim is to foster europe 's competitiveness .
otherwise , we will witness the rise of real anti-europeanism .
the european commission work programme is a key document in this regard .
in my opinion , the solution is not austerity in wage or budget .
but i am afraid nobody in the commission is listening to me .
member state that face economic problem could provide skilled labour to germany .
why not adopt a labour market with european added value ?
within the member state , we have to face supply and demand .
we have to strengthen europe with a european skilled labour force .
this is missing in the programme and i strongly propose it .
the progressive force must stick together in this case .
it is also important that we convey this message correctly .
university and school must make a contribution to creating a smart europe .
the field of research and development face particular challenge in this respect .
parliament and the commission must look to the future together .
despite that , i do have some comment to make .
example of this might include latvia , greece and recently also ireland .
however , i think this belongs to a longer discussion .
however , the second type of policy - stimulative policy - are essential .
unfortunately , there is nothing about this in the work programme .
it is not enough to carry out social impact assessment of european legislation .
the commission ha already carried out six or seven different study .
what do we find now in this work programme ?
firstly , strengthening economic governance and initiating the european semester .
we were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance .
the second point concern the continuation of the work on financial regulation .
the project are on the table , or will be soon .
that is what we are expecting from the commission today .
i would like to make some political and some professional comment .
( hu ) mr president , i will try to be very brief .
it would certainly be worthwhile to make progress here .
we should show more recognition of the commission 's ambition on this point .
i believe the european commission ha the power to change thing .
we are also anticipating with interest the legislative initiative on smart energy network .
we now have around 30 directorates-general and 26 commissioner .
the european union is making every effort to end this economic crisis .
we are not asking them not to reduce their contribution .
today , however , life ha brought massive change .
we must protect our economy from piratical and slave-labour economy .
our objective for 2011 have , therefore , been established .
the number of strategy which we have adopted is sufficient .
we must act similarly in the reform of financial institution and their supervision .
( sk ) mr president , the work programme submitted is ambitious .
it includes area which will help to fulfil the 2020 strategy .
we all know what a lengthy business european legislation is .
the vote will take place during the part-session in december .
the commission 's work programme for 2011 is clearly based on continuity .
woman are completely forgotten by and left out of this programme .
the excuse chosen by the budget wrecker are rather feeble .
it is quite irresponsible to limit budget flexibility in a time of crisis .
we must , on the contrary , increase flexibility in a crisis .
an agenda for new skill and job ( debate )
both should contribute to reach our 2020 employment and education target .
yes , the crisis ha wiped out million of job .
creating more and better job is in our hand .
we must enable everyone who can work to actually do so .
we need better job quality and working condition for all employee .
'new skill and job ' proposes practical tool in this respect .
commissioner vassiliou will be able to say more about this .
experience with implementation tell u when and where there is room for improvement .
last , but certainly not least , we need to create more job .
urgent action is therefore needed , especially on the education side .
upgrading skill should not be a luxury for the highly qualified .
secondly , we need to provide people with the right skill for employment .
in time of crisis , especially acute crisis , we need a vision .
we must make it easier for young people to open their own business .
we must make it easier for business to take on more people .
we are at your side ; we shall monitor and fight with you .
there is an absolute necessity to lock the two together .
i do not know about you , commissioner , but that shook me .
your focus is on poverty through work , instead of on increasing prosperity .
however , poverty is not a good accompaniment to progress .
please continue to work on this agenda and introduce the necessary improvement .
are we sure we know all the need of young people ?
i would like to thank you for your initiative .
i would like to endorse what mr schroedter said in this respect .
in my view , this will not create any new job .
measure of this kind simply turn secure job into precarious job .
we must not allow this to happen in future .
this is why european society need to become a knowledge-based society .
more than 20 % of them do not have a job .
i welcome the agenda presented much more than the strategy .
we must adopt specific measure to support employment and effective monitoring .
the commissioner mentioned better education and investment in people .
i wish to draw attention to the high school dropout rate .
what i spoke about wa better working condition and quality job .
i regret that m schroedter did not understand it perfectly .
this is also very important if we want to speak about quality job .
these are initiative for 10 year and for all member state .
it is not about addressing short-term emergency financial situation in certain member state .
europe need to increase it competitiveness in an ever-growing global competitive environment .
it seems that the same process ha started in ireland , a well .
on the other hand , germany ha announced that it need skilled labour .
there is no reason for germany to import such labour from third country .
the next item is question time ( b7-0563/2010 ) .
however , they must be of high quality and have clear learning objective .
a second set of issue is labour market segmentation .
young people are in a difficult position in term of job security .
this mean that young people bear the brunt of adjustment .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
should the procedure for recognising company established by young people be legally regulated ?
we will have to monitor the situation and work with the member state .
three year ago , the european council set u some ambitious climate goal .
we have set binding target for renewable energy for every member state .
the next step involves removing the administrative obstacle to renewable energy .
the member state can be flexible in their choice of technology .
i have two question , firstly regarding the 2020 strategy .
this involves making intelligent energy saving and using energy in a targeted way .
i am planning to visit the three baltic state next spring .
in comparison to these area , our energy network are lagging far behind .
thus , project are being financed in bulgaria and slovakia .
i wa pleased to hear the commissioner 's answer .
( lt ) thank you for your answer , commissioner .
we have been working recently with some member state on community-based service .
will the commission explain what these important issue are ?
this word 'restructuring ' is being bandied about a lot outside the house .
however , my question is about a slightly different matter .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his answer a well .
we , too , are making effort to eliminate obstacle to their mobility .
in 2008 , the commission established the eu sport forum .
member of the commission . - let me start with the last question .
of course , i will follow very closely what he doe .
it is the member state which decides on this matter .
subject : fraud and custom loss due to cigarette smuggling
member state are also losing out on excise duty .
i want to thank the commissioner for his very comprehensive reply .
a he said , tobacco smuggling is a very lucrative business .
member of the commission . - i will try to be very brief .
i have to emphasise that the chinese authority are ready for this cooperation .
subject : common consolidated corporate tax base ( ccctb )
the commission ha no plan to make proposal on corporate tax rate .
member state will continue to decide their own corporate tax rate .
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
i think that act a a disincentive for foreign direct investment .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:35 and resumed at 21:00 )
a country can be admired for it economic achievement .
the world 's most populous country deserves what we enjoy in europe .
it ha reacted excessively harshly , both internally and externally .
however , we must not confuse this with a strategy of confrontation .
i hope that in this house we will be just that .
that , i believe , is fundamentally our main issue .
we know that there are double standard here in europe .
the chinese communist party warns foreign government not to attend the ceremony .
i want to express my disappointment at the omission of this fundamental matter .
no government that succumbed to this despicable blackmail would be worthy of respect .
if they are not freed , it is china that will lose prestige .
china is a superpower and it should start acting like one responsibly .
that wa the first thing i wanted to share with you today .
unfortunately , i have to point out one fly in the ointment .
a large proportion of the responsibility lie with the member state .
you are not yet responsible for this , mr cioloş .
that is something that need to be addressed in the reform .
that may well lie behind the measure taken in scotland .
i fear , however , that what we are getting is not that .
we do not need any more over-emphasis on this particular position .
can i comment on what mr lyon just said ?
in the context of this programme , several assessment have been conducted .
the study concentrated on two category of measure : agro-environmental and farm modernisation .
it is not the commission that is adding administrative task .
a i have already said , the commission ha already simplified thing .
there is still the need to simplify at member state level .
to my mind , there are two aspect to this issue .
firstly , there is everything to do with the request for aid .
i have in mind the example of crop rotation .
these measure should enable u to simplify the obligation imposed on farmer .
this represents a considerable amount of work for the future .
every year , the commission controller visit member state before visiting the farmer .
they go there with a critical eye to find what is not right .
no pretext may be invoked to get around this crucial requirement of transparency .
their job is to produce food , not to write book .
we must finally learn to work together and not against one another .
i recall that the resolution that we adopted itself also gave this warning .
i imagine this is the commission 's favoured approach .
i have concern about the lack of clarity and the timescale for approval .
excessive regulation mean le competitiveness , while excessive inflexibility mean le efficient operation .
i would describe such a recommendation a the maximum tolerable level of bureaucracy .
measure providing training and information to potential beneficiary must also be expanded .
what they need is a simpler and more responsive cap .
it must be greener and contribute to climate change mitigation .
all of this , perhaps , on a decreasing budget .
in 2005 , the european commission undertook to simplify the common agricultural policy .
global food demand will continue to grow in future .
the european union ought to be able to help meet global food demand .
i hope that this will not be the case here .
there are a lot of thing that can be done .
this is another thing which render the simplification of the cap particularly necessary .
they ask for fewer check and control and easier way of doing business .
i want to repeat my comment of last thursday .
i think there is also a credibility issue for the european union .
the future cap must be understandable to farmer , but also to taxpayer .
without further simplification of the cap , this will not be possible .
in particular , i commend the commissioner for what he ha done .
i am deeply convinced that most of the farmer are conscientious and honest .
in many case , the cap is helping farmer to work .
a regard transparency , there is a decision by the court of justice .
in writing . - let me pose a simple question .
why is there a common agricultural policy at all ?
we still have farmer willing and able to produce food .
let me suggest the easiest simplification of all : abolish the cap !
this , in itself , distorts competition on the internal market .
it is not yet known how these payment will be made .
the sector is certainly facing a number of challenge .
in any event , we will make sure that this happens .
it is true that they are hibernating while we are having this discussion .
we must identify the cause of this problem and take the necessary countermeasure .
we must ensure that these programme are continued after 2013 .
we must not leave the beekeeper to fight this battle on their own .
they are absolutely crucial to agriculture and food production .
indeed , without them , there is no food production .
only then can concrete step be taken to address the problem .
in essence , support for the agriculture sector should be strengthened after 2013 .
i think we have an opportunity to do something positive .
of course , orchard are particularly reliant on bee for pollination .
i think we can pay tribute to her this evening .
such a change in biodiversity would put vital food diversity at risk .
this profound disturbance of ecosystem would destroy all prospect for future generation .
in europe , many beekeeper have had to shut up shop .
without foraging bee , most crop would not produce a satisfactory yield .
madam president , commissioner : thank you for your comment .
we also need greater emphasis on organic and ecological method .
i would just like to concentrate on one issue .
the woman 's institute represents million of ordinary people in the uk .
i would ask the commissioner to take that opportunity and run with it .
we need to find long-term effective solution to this pressing issue .
the role of bee in plant pollination is indispensable .
we have to stop experimenting with what we grow and what we eat .
this example of bee is maybe representative of european integration .
we have a problem and we do not know the reason for it .
i support the call for research but with some caution .
we need to look at what we are comparing across the european union .
the commission 's decision is therefore of paramount importance to romanian beekeeper .
so you could say that she is the queen bee of parliament .
there are a number of issue which have been raised .
these thing need to be addressed with research and also with target .
two point are particularly important to me in this respect .
my second point is about the product of beekeeping , the honey .
i would like to ask the commission to take action on this basis .
this ha been made possible by public , national and european aid .
i do not want to talk about plant protection product and pesticide today .
in that regard , we already have programme that are being promoted .
so i think we have got target ahead of u .
they will no doubt also be included in the cap after 2013 .
the vote will take place on thursday ( 25 november 2010 ) .
beekeeping is one of the key activity supporting agricultural production .
anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
also present with u are representative of the belgian presidency and the commission .
i am here quoting the eurogroup and ecofin minister .
well , more automaticity is exactly what we propose .
all the breakthrough we achieved now need to be translated into legislative text .
i trust all the institution will keep up the momentum .
it is important to look at it in a wider context .
the summit made a right analysis and agreed on a process .
i intend to make this a regular feature of the european council meeting .
now the normal legislative procedure must run it course over the coming month .
all this action is not taking place in a vacuum .
the atmosphere at the summit wa intimate , friendly , and focused .
we must therefore address our citizen ' valid concern .
today , the irish government ha called for and rightly obtained european solidarity .
and every time the same few country oppose it .
mr president , i would like to add one last thing .
no , the reality in europe is somewhat different .
the german-french merkel-sarkozy decision-making partnership ha done a deal with mr cameron .
everyone know that and it also need to be said openly .
i fear that there are some people who want that to happen .
mr merkel say that the private sector must be included .
what mr merkel is doing constitutes a stress test for the euro .
we then said 'ok , we will forget about it then ' .
in the afternoon over coffee , the financial transaction tax wa buried .
people are now saying that the united kingdom doe not want it .
doe the united kingdom actually decide everything in europe ?
we live in a democratic age and under a democratic system .
i will ask you , colleague , to apologise to the chamber .
the view expressed by herr schulz meet the case .
we do not want our discussion to be disturbed in such a way .
it is impossible to hold our discussion in such an atmosphere .
i shall read article 152 ( 3 ) in my mother tongue .
mr president , firstly i believe that what ha happened is very serious .
we in germany have enough money to resolve our problem ourselves . '
well , we saw what the outcome of that wa .
we saw it in 2004 and 2005 with france and germany .
what mr schulz is doing now is exactly the same ...
( the speaker continued but his microphone wa switched off )
i find it truly bizarre how quickly this pro-european spirit ha been lost .
the complete absence of this spirit is one of our problem .
my third point is that i think mr verhofstadt is absolutely right .
economic governance is what need to take shape now .
it is one thing to talk now about tax dumping in ireland .
we know that the countdown ha begun for spain and portugal .
this is something that we need to weigh up together .
they are told just how indebted their country are every day .
so i will defend the eu 's spend in my constituency every day .
that is not only completely counterproductive , i also think it is absurd .
the precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored .
he should perhaps be the pin-up boy of the eurosceptic movement .
but just look around this chamber this morning , mr van rompuy .
poor old barroso here look like he ha seen a ghost .
it is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything .
but is this not really just the bunker mentality ?
just who the hell do you people think you are ?
untold million must suffer so that your euro-dream can continue .
well it will not work , because it is portugal next .
after that , i suspect it will be spain .
i call on these institution to be more responsible towards taxpayer .
i would just like to say one more thing regarding cancún .
where doe that leave pandora , i ask myself .
just look at the idea of a financial transaction tax .
the economic benefit of such a system of eurobonds are huge and clear .
i think you prefer practical action : i understand that .
we are talking here about a debt crisis in our member state .
i would also like it to remain that way .
however , we are joined together in a shared destiny by the euro .
germany and france have been blackmailed by the united kingdom .
the commission must impose the sanction , not the finance minister .
the finance minister must take the decision again here .
however , the decision made in deauville wa clearly a mistake .
it doe not have to be like this , however .
i believe that the citizen of this continent deserve much better than that .
mr president , this is a debate about economic governance .
across europe many country , including my own , face difficult economic time .
i hope we have finally drawn a line under those account .
aid from europe this is not , and therefore we strongly oppose it .
so it is time to say bye-bye euro , bye-bye euro .
mr schulz 's scolding is therefore completely uncalled for .
i just do not understand some of this complaining .
we will have our say in the codecision procedure .
then we will negotiate on this matter again with the council .
allow me to say something about the necessity of amendment to the treaty .
a justification of the rescue package in accordance with article 122 is required .
( pt ) mr president , let u be frank .
when a process wa set up it wa done too late .
the president of the commission is now proposing a consolidation of this system .
there need to be a european mechanism for consolidating sovereign debt .
the commission and the new president must uphold this agenda .
the president of the commission can not be beholden to the ecofin council .
this is what we need to show the european public .
ensure comparability of all element and relation between internal and external imbalance .
this would enable the repayment of debt , in all our member state .
it remains for the council to take on it responsibility this december .
the european union wa created thanks to the strong government at the time .
it is obvious , therefore , that growth need to continue .
trust is based on a reasonable balance of income and expenditure .
thirdly , there is an obvious need for check and balance mechanism .
it will facilitate the detection of emerging imbalance and risk .
it implementation will therefore create a new robust crisis management framework .
what is the response of the leader of the council and the commission ?
how long are they going to insist on going down this route ?
the structural imbalance which the crisis ha only exacerbated go beyond debt .
there are many people over there also in denial .
i believe this is the biggest crisis that we have had .
there is no going back , measure must be taken .
this is the behaviour of what are mainly socialist .
is this solution under serious discussion with these country ?
this demonstrates that once again in the european union we lack reliable information .
those who are critical of significant economising are certainly on the wrong path .
i think what we need now is action and not more comment .
we are dealing with very sensitive global financial market .
some of the comment sometimes have a self-fulfilling prophecy effect .
but in the end , we have to be realistic .
some of you said the problem are in the euro area .
i am sorry to say they are not only in the euro area .
the reality is that the euro wa not the cause of the problem .
that is the responsible method that we have to follow .
it is the very first time in my career .
some of you have said that we should learn lesson .
there is a french proverb that say 'our act follow u ' .
the council make these decision , according to the treaty of lisbon .
we would have discovered the problem of competitiveness in certain country .
honourable member , let u not always target the wrong enemy .
portugal is not experiencing a property crisis or a property bubble .
it financial sector is not too high for the country .
i insist on this point : let u not target the wrong enemy .
i regret the fact that we have not managed to reach an agreement .
during my career , i have often seen conflict within my party .
they are right , but we must go through that stage first .
however , we do need a positive policy for growth and employment .
we re-established positive growth eleven month after the financial crisis erupted .
this year , the average growth figure will stand at around 1.5 % .
this is not only growth based on restocking , recovery programme and export .
it is also growth that is also fed by internal demand .
and what is more , because they belong to the euro area .
there must be an end to the transfer union .
we can not keep patching up a sickly monetary union .
instead we need a strong , core european monetary union .
we still believe that political leader are responsible for making decision .
they are , and that is indeed the essence of politics .
first of all , the market are not satisfied with statement alone .
there will be no success in rebalancing growth without addressing currency tension .
another priority concern the volatility of the price of raw material .
europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity .
of course , it is important for more member to be here .
it is wrong for them not to be here .
however , they are not really hearing anything new anyway .
what is happening with regard to the financial transaction tax ?
it is not on the agenda of the g20 summit in seoul .
however , do not avoid the issue any longer .
for europe alone we are talking about eur 200 billion per year .
similarly , we shall have to revisit the issue of financial regulation .
in this respect , i shall offer you a suggestion .
we must be a proactive force , we must be a decisive force .
mr president , i think that you should invite him to do so .
this is particularly important given the support it received during the crisis .
a financial transaction tax should be promoted at global level .
protocol to the partnership and cooperation agreement between the ec and moldova (
information on medicinal product ( community code relating to medicinal product ) (
this ha been agreed among all the political group .
i would very much like to thank my fellow member from all group .
i would like to thank you very sincerely for this .
if he doe not do so , he must leave the chamber .
is it the wish of the house that mr bloom should leave ?
( loud protest and cry of 'no ! ' from the efd )
those who wish mr bloom to stay please raise your hand .
( further loud protest from the efd and reply of 'be quiet ! '
we have had danny cohn-bendit calling u mentally ill .
mr bloom , i am going to invoke rule 152 .
if you will not leave , i will have you removed .
( interjection from mr bloom : 'do your damnedest ! ' )
i ask you to do so out of respect for democratic right .
mr gollnisch , you do not need to challenge me .
that is all i have to say to you .
i therefore intend to suspend the sitting for five minute .
village were burning and the population had to be evacuated .
we also expect china to clearly condemn this act .
we would like to convey our condolence to the family of the victim .
the first person to ask for the floor this morning wa mr madlener .
those are unacceptable term to use , by one member to another .
they go far beyond what we would regard a acceptable in this house .
( fr ) mr president , i shall be very brief .
please do not give the microphone to mr gollnisch .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i have no idea what the efficacy of these cure is .
they could never have got these rule through the national parliament .
he very often us the word 'fascist ' himself ...
that is why i voted in favour of it .
mr hannan , i can see where you are going with this .
he will make that point of order when the president is present .
that i think is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
you said mr gollnisch doe not speak for you .
mr gollnisch is a member of the non-attached group .
firstly , they must not cause disproportionate difficulty for small business .
the removal of a member can materially affect the outcome .
no , mr hannan , you strayed from the general to the particular .
it is absolutely right that we are trying to tackle this issue .
surely when a german national , a socialist talk ...
( de ) mr president , anti-counterfeiting is an extremely important issue .
anyone who want a fair world must fight hard to combat counterfeiting .
this contravenes the right to privacy and look like an attempt at censorship .
the decision made on this matter , today , slightly improve the situation .
i wa very grateful to get the joint ppe/ecr resolution .
firstly , it go no further than the acquis communautaire .
it is an open mechanism that country can join if they want to .
this vote symbolises european solidarity in the face of natural disaster .
this solidarity is being shown today in ireland and tomorrow in france .
the legal requirement having been fulfilled , i agree with this amending budget .
the overall annual budget available for the solidarity fund is eur 1 billion .
otherwise the misuse of resource and other offence are inevitable .
eur 1 billion per year is available to the european solidarity fund .
i would like to thank mr surján for his excellent work .
it is therefore worthy of particular support and attention by the european union .
moldovan involvement in eu programme is an important step along that path .
negotiation with the republic of moldova began in march 2008 .
political stability and democracy are essential for the full application of the protocol .
that is why we disagree with the adopted resolution .
the republic of moldova is one of the poorest country of europe .
it will lead to closer integration between moldova and the eu .
moldova 's human development index is one of the lowest in the region .
the failure of the constitutional referendum of 5 september 2010 is regrettable .
in 2004 , moldova wa included within the european neighbourhood policy .
i would like to thank mr watson for his excellent work .
poverty , corruption and human trafficking are problem that we must solve together .
a it prepares for eu accession , moldova face numerous serious structural reform .
the eu must continue to support the effort moldova ha made .
it is particularly important to strengthen democracy and the rule of law .
patient should have better access to good quality information on prescription-only medicine .
directive 2001/83/ec establishes a community code relating to medicinal product for human use .
therefore , the provision regarding information about prescribed drug need to be updated .
the pharmaceutical industry 's goal will never be one of philanthropy .
moreover , there is a very fine line between information and advertising .
i can not , however , vote for such a weak text .
in view of these consideration , i abstained from the vote .
i would like to thank mr fjellner for his excellent work .
the information supplied to patient should fulfil the following main characteristic :
this will allow the 'patients ' voice ' to be heard .
this precludes self-regulation , which the original proposal did not do .
the advertising of medicinal product continues to be prohibited .
information for patient is a government , not an individual responsibility .
we need government drug agency and free national health service .
the pharmaceutical industry 's goal will never be one of philanthropy .
moreover , there is a very fine line between information and advertising .
parliament ha rightly decided to focus on and protect the interest of patient .
patient must have the right to obtain complete , correct information about medicine .
doctor must be able to give their patient recommendation on medicine .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the report .
large industrial group have already started to restrict their use .
however , this ha not been an easy vote .
weee arisings are estimated to grow to 12.3 million tonne by 2020 .
these problem have not been solved with rohs 1.0 .
it is estimated that weee will increase to 12.3 million tonne by 2020 .
either electrical substance are hazardous , or they are not .
however , i find the fact that there are so many exception problematic .
rather , there are numerous cadmium telluride-free alternative on the market .
this is about setting the right regulatory framework for coherent sustainable investment !
our task is to compel manufacturer to move over to le harmful material .
these argument need to be weighed up before specific ban are laid down .
i voted in favour of the report for a variety of reason .
i would highlight the simplification and increased consistency of the new legislation .
i would like to thank mr evans for her excellent work .
the key aspect of this recast of the directive are a follows :
i welcome that agreement wa reached on first reading .
weee arisings are estimated to grow to 12.3 million tonne by 2020 .
weee is a complex waste stream , including several hazardous substance .
i really hope this report will help to solve those problem .
this report is a step in the right direction .
it extends the category of equipment to , inter alia , medical apparatus .
after all , the two legislative instrument are inextricably interlinked .
that is why i welcome the adoption of this resolution .
it is a strong text which should have united all meps .
unfortunately , it wa only adopted by a slim majority .
our competitiveness in the globalised economy is at stake .
the resolution also endeavoured to guarantee access to medicine in developing country .
it doe not introduce , for example , the so-called 'three-strikes ' procedure .
it is essential that this agreement come into effect a soon a possible .
any delay will open the gate to the plain theft of intellectual property .
piracy on the internet is an extremely topical issue these day .
many internet service provider and european union citizen are involved in unethical activity .
inaction a regard the prevention of counterfeiting promotes impunity and appears cynical .
we can not ignore the progress that ha been made .
europe ha an obligation to continue concentrating it effort on two issue .
i would also note that parliament ha the right to veto international agreement .
the number were 306 in favour , 322 against , with 26 abstention .
if we get a no vote then , the agreement will be scrapped .
i therefore voted for this motion for a resolution .
it is important that parliament take it responsibility for international agreement very seriously .
the commission wa very active and cooperation wa very close .
we shall now go and sign the legislative package .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
a new energy strategy for europe 2011 - 2020 ( debate )
this also concern the need to build a renewable energy market in europe .
this is often opposed by monopoly and the government which protect them .
we , a member of the european parliament , insist on this .
the position we are starting from could be described a extremely difficult .
we have a single market that is not yet complete .
secondly , we have a patent lack of infrastructure .
this ha to do with acceptance by the people and transparency .
another part of our strategy is the issue of affordable energy .
today , china represents 50 % of global windmill production .
we need to implement ambitious , concrete policy target in europe .
come on europe , come on commission ; let 's walk the talk .
my first message is , 'implement , implement , implement ' .
then we have to add targeted policy to that .
renewable technology is our biggest export market in all energy technology .
gas will be important , a will oil in the future .
the report emphasis all the most important challenge facing european energy policy .
this is a very bad coincidence - this process ha gone very badly .
i do not think we should act like this .
this is the first realistic strategy we have seen .
we have two small pipeline : the itgi and the tap .
they are ready , they are up to speed .
nabucco is big and it is therefore complicated and there may be delay .
move forward , therefore , with the two small pipeline .
the reason is that there is a very simple example of this .
two major project are currently being developed : south stream and nabucco .
it is almost a case of having either south stream or nabucco .
we still lack 50 % of financing for the set-plan .
how can we be competitive and modern if we take decision like this ?
our decision in europe are crucial for our competitiveness .
energy efficiency is also the cheapest way of reducing co2 emission .
i therefore welcome the european commission 's initiative to fill the gap .
the energy sector is the driving force behind economic growth .
europe ha had a strategy for energy and combating climate change since 2008 .
scientific research and technology play a key role in achieving these objective .
it take many year to get energy facility up and running .
the service life of such construction is several decade .
we need a strategy document for energy development until at least 2050 .
therefore , the competitiveness of the economy is going to depend upon energy .
why is the driving force of progress not effectiveness ?
the operational programme between and within member state are becoming increasingly important .
there is no need for new supplementary binding target .
there is still a gap between word and deed .
the first of two focal point is energy efficiency : a great opportunity .
europe 's dependency on energy increase proportionally with the increase in it population .
for natural gas supply this figure may reach 80 % .
we must aim to further diversify transport route and acquisition source .
we discussed this again yesterday with the president of the commission .
unfortunately , very little ha been said about this today .
mr reul is right : we need many energy source .
these are the engine of a future-oriented european economy .
thirdly , it urge u to fully implement current european legislation .
we have ambitious aim to reduce the climate change process .
construction of the 522 turbine will be completed in 2011 .
this will enable dobrogea to supply 50 % of national energy consumption .
infrastructure is another key element for an efficient energy market .
the p8 pipeline is a good example of this .
if we do , what will the consensus be ?
it is right that we need a long-term strategy .
do we know what technical capability will emerge in the next 40 year ?
what new political interest the member state will have ?
it is quite simply because that wa what wa decided .
if you want something different , let me know .
in our strategy we are only creating the heading for this .
it is currently 500 billion cubic metre per year .
will it be le or will it be more ?
this will also be addressed in the road map 2050 .
moreover , china refers to nuclear power a a form of renewable energy .
i also need you when it come to the european budget .
with this in mind , we certainly have sufficient opportunity for constructive cooperation .
it is time for u to talk about a genuine european energy strategy .
there are currently gap in the implementation of eu energy legislation .
in a capitalist world the term 'uncompetitive ' is synonymous with social scourge .
this represents a failure in all aspect of the stated objective .
the need for a long-term strategic vision on energy is obvious .
the new proposed energy strategy aim to serve this need .
this is an absolute priority for the eu 's stability and security .
developing modern and efficient energy infrastructure will need priority investment .
the potential of this sector in europe is untapped .
this abandoned land could also be used from a renewable energy perspective .
obtaining energy is one of the most important challenge facing today 's world .
the rapporteur link this objective to the establishment of a low emission economy .
it is no secret that poland 's energy security is based on coal .
this is another document which ha no connection with a strategy .
preparation for cancún climate change conference ( 29 november-10 december ) ( debate )
focusing on an 'all or nothing ' approach is no longer possible .
what , then , are the main element of the eu 's position ?
all the major economy must be involved in this post-2012 framework .
i hope that this report will help restore confidence among party .
i am also looking forward to working with you in cancún .
the eu alone under a second commitment period is neither sufficient nor credible .
i can tell you honestly today : we are almost there .
that is the way our priority will best be heard .
i am very concerned that we are putting our intellectual property at risk .
our industry is investing money and manpower in development .
presenting ourselves in a credible manner in cancún is therefore important .
if the ground is not properly prepared , there will be no harvest .
mr president , ahead of the copenhagen summit we had very high expectation .
the distinction between developed and developing country strike me a odd .
i want u to move up from 20 % to 30 % .
i just do not feel that this is happening at the moment .
i know this commissioner 's enthusiasm for the subject .
i am not sure she ha the full backing of the college .
today , if we make no change , we shall reach 19 % .
they have gained billion of euro thanks to european climate policy .
let u take up this leadership in energy transition and the new economy .
there is a need for new long-term funding source a well .
mr president , choosing sunny mexico for cop 16 wa a good move .
take a look at the figure produced by the world meteorological organisation .
i am also shocked at the low level of acceptance among the population .
of course , we also need to have honesty on the market .
to hide behind purely legal argument in this regard is not good enough .
therefore , my appeal for greater communication is important .
that did not work there and it will not work in cancún either .
we should therefore take climate protection measure to protect our own interest .
that will be necessary during the course of the process in any case .
here too , we are relying on everyone else .
i believe that our offer should be to establish kyoto ii .
we will have no problem doing this ; we will achieve it .
different people could speak , but they had to convey the same message .
that is the first point i should like to emphasise .
this show the importance and the urgency of what we must do .
let u remember that deforestation amount to 20 % of greenhouse gas emission .
projectbased credit should be limited to the poorest developing country .
additional fund must be provided for financing climate measure .
the eu must present ambitious target for the reduction of greenhouse gas .
we will lose job , and that will harm our european economy .
may i dwell a while on the real fact of this superfluous conference ?
what wa the objective of the climate change conference , now ?
ah , yes , it wa the reduction of co2 emission .
currently , 11 000 hectare of mangrove forest are being cleared in cancún .
what wa the objective of the climate change conference , again ?
oh , yes , it wa the protection of forest .
mr president , may i offer the eu some modest advice ?
our demand basically concern two issue : the redd agreement and financing .
then there is the matter of the eu 's role , of leadership .
more ambition , more fund and better negotiation are what is needed .
cancún would be not nearly a bad , of course .
but be warned : we , the people , are onto you .
wasting over eur 4 billion of european taxpayer ' money is unacceptable .
more and more scientist are going public to challenge climate orthodoxy .
the credibility of the ipcc ha been shot to piece .
copenhagen failed for the same reason that cancún will fail .
india and china will not forego progress in the name of climate alarmism .
our green policy are probably unnecessary , certainly ineffectual and ruinously expensive .
let u also not forget the gender dimension in climate change policy .
however , i would like to comment on some of the amendment tabled .
we can not change such important decision from one year to the next .
i believe that we should not distance ourselves again from third country .
only by changing ourselves can we urge others to follow our example .
it is a very difficult compromise for all country .
we should not delude ourselves into thinking we shall achieve immediate success .
it is also important to have commitment which all the country can accept .
they should have access to money from the union .
let u try to bring our eu know-how to bear in climate policy .
it is therefore crucial that concrete commitment are made and realistic objective set .
nature , however , can take no account of every-day political necessity .
we will find the solution by breaking with this system .
reaching an agreement on cutting carbon emission is vitally important .
we urgently need to make progress in combating climate change .
so-called carbon offsetting is no solution in this context .
it is not the pessimist who achieve big thing .
two year ago we were more or le alone in setting target .
the rich country would have to deal with it - the developed country .
today , because of copenhagen they acknowledge that they have a co-responsibility .
we must try to build on that in cancún , and we will .
one of the reason is the lack of progress in the american senate .
we all know that that is the reason why .
the alternative is very bad ; it is very grim .
it is not a matter of adjusting our ambition .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 november 2010 .
this doe not mean that the eu 's ambition should be scaled back .
in writing . - ( hu ) towards a post-kyoto protocol ...
the european union must set a good example by demonstrating a unified position .
it is no longer possible to deny global climate change .
we have a responsibility for the future of the whole world .
i believe that we are the one who can still save this planet .
however , we must stand together firmly and in unity .
the climate negotiation in cancún start in only a week .
we hope that these discussion will lead to concrete result .
at the same time , our relation go far beyond that .
the cooperation opportunity of the two continent are enormous .
this will notably require promoting a more business- and investment-friendly environment .
the summit will be an excellent opportunity to plot our way forward .
both mr chastel and mr piebalgs have spoken about this .
a if it were written by somebody wearing rose-tinted spectacle .
the reality is , however , far from rosy .
in short , it is hard to talk about africa a one unit .
madam president , relation between europe and africa are under strain .
madam president , i am very grateful for the honourable member 's intervention .
i said to the house that handout will not simply alleviate poverty .
it also despair of seeing these agreement signed rapidly .
it is this listening that the acp-european union joint parliamentary assembly enforces .
in particular , the imbalance and corruption of cooperation initiative must be fought .
in my view , the european commission communication of 11 november is welcome .
however , i believe that we can do more than this .
the european union and africa are frequently out of harmony on these matter .
over 100 million people do not have access to safe water .
the union is the largest donor of development aid .
we must intensify our aid for africa , and make it more effective .
at the tripoli summit , a second action plan will be adopted .
( fr ) madam president , that would certainly be possible .
but ultimately only african can solve africa 's problem .
we must constantly be directing social policy to a higher level .
it is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial state .
finally , i would like to provide a summary of the following priority .
however , we have been very poor at implementing such objective .
in libya , will eu representative voice their disapproval of mugabe 's presence ?
secondly , what is the eu doing to actively promote good governance ?
soon we will go to cancún and next week to the eu-africa summit .
this is how we must see the forthcoming eu-africa summit .
of course , the african continent ha a whole range of problem .
however , we know that there is still much to be done .
the economic crisis ha unsettled and is still unsettling europe .
africa ha more self-confidence ; and good reason for it .
however , it is very clear that there is an african union .
it is also important that africa understands it power in the international arena .
african country are looking for representation in accordance with their political way .
that mean that this summit is a very particular summit .
i believe that we need to address two critical issue .
that is why we address the issue of energy .
yes , good governance and human right are on the agenda .
sustainability is also to the fore in our policy .
we do not finance the serengeti project , for example .
no eu money is involved in any project that damage the environment .
each project is evaluated on the basis of an environmental impact assessment .
we have a very sustainable approach to the project .
i believe that this is a very particular summit .
all contribution , particularly those made by parliamentarian , are welcome .
i should also like to reply to one question in particular .
the vote will take place during the next part-session in december .
the next item is the debate on the situation in western sahara .
now calm ha returned to laâyoune , even though underlying tension still remain .
normally , the debate is interrupted for question time and then continued afterwards .
it must speak out loud and clear about the principle that drive u .
this incident ha claimed new human casualty , which we regret .
commissioner , thank you very much for your clear word .
we therefore demand an independent investigation under the aegis of the united nation .
we are not talking about a conflict between equal .
it all very well to want good trade relation with morocco .
morocco ha no sovereignty over the western sahara ; i repeat , none .
the dismantling of the dignity camp should never have been allowed .
when will we say that this course is unacceptable ?
we must not ignore the recent action of the government of morocco .
this is a good idea . it should be done .
i would like to express my solidarity with all of their family .
i want to ask for calm from the party .
i therefore ask the european union for greater commitment .
realpolitik must not be an excuse for turning a blind eye .
i think it would be helpful to work determinedly towards these specific objective .
yes , we had to condemn the violence on both side .
for these people the power of the world do not come together .
it is but a short step from negligence to complicity .
france bear particular responsibility for encouraging morocco to continue with the occupation .
so there , in essence , are the challenge we believe important .
there have been 35 year of illegal suffering and occupation .
morocco is repressing with hatred what it know to be a different people .
when the gaza aid flotilla wa attacked there wa an immediate international outcry .
in my opinion , these incident must be fully investigated .
i very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here .
if it ha nothing to hide , the inquiry should be carried out .
i hope they will come and engage in a discussion with u .
i believe that it is a stage of this dialogue .
this will present another opportunity to continue this dialogue .
i believe that it is very balanced and very correct .
seven motion for resolution have been tabled to wind up the debate .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:00 and resumed at 21:00 )
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
cathy ashton took part in the discussion on international issue .
this subject wa also raised in your resolution in february .
it is good and important for u to make progress in this area .
'balanced ' mean asking for improvement and at the same time offering assistance .
i have to deplore a few mistake in the printing of the text .
there is no need for internationalisation of the internal controversy in ukraine .
i am particularly happy to see long-awaited progress towards a free trade area .
ten or hundred of thousand of ukrainian citizen are taking to the street .
they are protesting against tax law that they consider to be unfair .
i very much hope that that will continue to be the case .
that would not help the democratic development of ukraine .
i think this ha been a very good thing .
i would like to thank mr harm very much for her splendid word .
let u speak sincerely about the election , which did not satisfy u .
it is for ukrainian , and we are adopting it together .
it is clearly the most important player out of the eastern partnership country .
therefore , it is certainly an extremely important partner for the eu .
that probably also represented a defeat for the european union .
the eu is therefore clearly losing it attraction for ukrainian .
a major exception to this ha just been adopted .
at least that wa how it wa expressed in the german translation .
sadly , the local election have not lived up to our expectation .
let u leave the oligarch behind u and move towards a democratic state .
make sure that mr tymoshenko help to set up a constructive opposition .
advise mr tymoshenko in the same way a we did mr yanukovych .
yes , those election were not conducted in the way we wanted .
that issue is the closest possible cooperation between the european union and ukraine .
ukraine is a country divided between a pro-western west and a russian-facing east .
i have toured the russian fleet in sevastopol , on the crimean peninsula .
the russian will jealously guard access to the black sea from there .
i do , however , find two issue missing from the report .
one of them is a mention of minority in the ukraine .
the resolution is directed to both side of the 'blue-orange ' divide .
they are responsible , because it is they who hold power .
yesterday marked six year since the start of the orange revolution .
sadly , the huge potential of that change ha been wasted .
there is a similar problem at the commercial tv station channel 5 .
however , progress on reform and democracy are in the hand of ukraine .
we must also agree on the free trade agreement soon .
we are frightened by corruption and it entanglement with politics .
while there , we saw protest and numerous disturbance .
fellow member , nearly 1 million people of bulgarian origin live in ukraine .
at the same time , i would like to say something else .
we should support the process of ukraine 's european integration .
( lv ) mr president , i have a question for all member .
why did we need this resolution on ukraine at this time ?
to interfere in advance of the local election , it would appear .
however , subsequent amendment altered the quality of the law .
six motion for resolution have been tabled to wind up the debate .
the election were not free , fair or democratic .
it is this compromise which should become the position of parliament .
the eu must exert it influence in international trade to initiate a change .
at the same time , these international organisation should work together more .
it is therefore essential to integrate the climate issue into our trade policy .
it is therefore essential to reconcile these different issue .
i hope this will be reflected in the vote tomorrow .
we also tried to put an end to black or white debate .
the same is true for production process and method .
despite my interruption , you spoke for more than four-and-a-half minute .
i draw a rough line for every member of this house .
i am obliged to interrupt member if they speak too quickly .
you are very welcome to have a look at it .
but allow me to make a few general consideration .
other policy may offer key element or even better option for effective solution .
so there will always be choice to be made .
in general , international cooperation ha the potential to trigger more effective action .
on the other hand , it take two to tango .
the three report outline several possible direction of work in this respect .
we need to give ourselves the scope to think ahead and think big .
needle to say , the commission will continue to consider these orientation .
the committee on development ha tabled several remark about the saïfi report .
this allows some firm and member state to ignore these standard .
i would like to remind you about this once again .
i would like to focus primarily on one point .
however , i often wonder what these individual area of policy themselves achieve .
we also need to examine disincentive to the trade in such good .
similarly , the gsp scheme should be given proper teeth and be enforceable .
the eu ha trade relation with pakistan , for example .
i would like to thank the three rapporteur for their excellent work .
the time of tough , one-sided external economic aid should now be over .
these task are much more important than conventional trade interest .
they will enable it to network successfully with other economy .
at a political level , the machination of the rapporteur are rather impressive .
what ha this got to do with the european union ?
mr president , the document show a lack of economic understanding .
the naive reasoning in this report would be disastrous to the global economy .
who will ultimately pay the price for the pursuit of europe 's utopia ?
this fill me , personally , with very great optimism .
trade is an important instrument for transferring technology to developing country .
therefore , the barrier to green trade must be removed .
free , undistorted competition is a myth that destroys job and life .
these standard form an important basis for the discussion on free trade agreement .
paragraph 48 is highly critical of the common agricultural model .
however , this model guarantee a secure supply of high quality food .
the report refers to it apparent negative impact on climate change .
this must apply both to acp country and to china .
rather , we now want to see the concrete result of our demand .
we want to see legislation when this is necessary .
mr president , competition is the life of trade .
specific question have also been put , for example on child labour .
however , our position will be that we are in favour of this .
i think this would be a considerable contribution to development in sustainable condition .
we will therefore continue the discussion , a you said .
this is therefore , in a sense , an opportunity .
book on the economy have continued to be written after the 19th century .
mr president , a you can see , i had two minute left .
anti-dumping case - state of play and prospect ( debate )
i would like to look at one point in particular .
i would be interested in answer to the following question from the commission .
secondly , there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedure .
lastly , there is the question of dialogue with society .
mr president , we can now see the consequence here .
we talked previously about trade policy a an instrument for achieving other goal .
in concrete term , this is about selling product below cost .
one reason for this is the lack of a functioning appeal body .
it wa a chinese company and a belgian electronic company .
we are currently examining the implication of the withdrawal .
that is precisely what ha happened in this case .
at any time , parliament can obtain further information on request .
there wa also the specific question by mr moreira on the comitology .
there , i would like to be very clear .
we are not , because i truly believe it is not necessary .
i would consider doing so only once the doha round is over .
there wa also a specific question by the green member .
they are taken on the basis of a complaint by a company .
it need clear and enforceable rule within the new comitology .
anti-dumping is a good servant but a bad master .
anti-dumping duty can make supply more expensive - including for smes .
the commission is calculating this potential impact under the public interest test .
we have an sme helpline to make cooperation easier .
the special report are a tool which come into it own here .
the porsche affair is very significant in this regard .
i will say again that 56 % of complaint received are resolved amicably .
however , i also included a number of recommendation .
the european network of ombudsman is an important tool to this end .
i think that sharing information and good practice is essential in this regard .
mr president , the citizen must be at the heart of our concern .
this proximity also relates to our institution , however .
up to october 2010 , the ombudsman had no information at his disposal .
the commission regularly receives complaint from citizen about how national law is implemented .
here , the environmental impact assessment directive ha been poorly implemented .
unlike court ruling , an ombudsman 's decision are not legally binding .
in 35 case , i issued a critical remark .
the sustained reduction is good news , but this is still too many .
reducing the number of inadmissible complaint ha been a long-standing request of parliament .
during 2009 , the guide wa used by more than 26 000 people .
this increase must be at least partly attributed to outreach activity .
this is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the institution .
the most common allegation i examined in 2009 wa lack of transparency .
this is how we try to find the right solution in our work .
relation with the ombudsman have occasionally given rise to difference of opinion .
this ha been the case with inquiry concerning infringement procedure .
the commission always strives to cooperate closely with the ombudsman .
the commission welcome parliament 's response to this report .
the following remark pick up on some of the key issue .
for the moment , therefore , we reserve our position on all aspect .
i would like to apologise to the interpreter for speaking so quickly .
yes , i am afraid you did have a slight tendency to accelerate .
this is what you might call a fundamental principle of good administration .
such incident should no longer be encountered in future .
the situation revealed in the report creates a systematic problem .
this is not a new request , mr vice-president .
nothing ha really been done to solve this problem .
both the citizen and the protected environment are suffering .
this is what we called 'fortunate campania ' - oh dear !
the commission must immediately utilise all mean at it disposal in this regard .
that is , to monitor the member state ' compliance with eu legislation .
in light of this , i welcome mr lichtenberger 's report .
they are the one that the complaint are about .
parliament need to come up with a clear statement on this matter .
i would like to thank the ombudsman and mr paliadeli .
the report is comprehensible , concise and to the point .
the same applies logically to the office of the ombudsman a well .
the situation is no different for other member state .
extensive information campaign were proposed , and website launch were considered .
to tell the truth , your website discourages citizen from making complaint .
i would therefore like to make an appeal for simplification .
lady and gentleman , too much communication kill off information .
i wish you every success in finding systemic solution .
more than half of the complaint relate to the european commission .
i believe that the objective that were set for 2010 are extremely relevant .
the ombudsman made some clear recommendation and amendment were issued .
this demonstrates yet again how the house view these recommendation .
this occurred in a many a 56 % of case in 2009 .
in this respect , the porsche case is very serious .
i would like to emphasise this in the strongest possible term .
citizen first lodge well-justified complaint in their own country .
i think that all three report deserve attention , with only one reservation .
no wonder the eu ha never been so unpopular !
the eu ha already spent an enormous amount on propaganda and self-advertisement .
be that a it may , i think that we should be honest .
let u hope that the commission act a quickly a the commissioner spoke .
he certainly gave the interpreter a run for their money .
this is also reflected in the report on the ombudsman 's activity .
i should like to comment specifically on mr paliadeli 's report .
parliament will do this , commissioner , unless you change these practice .
( lt ) madam president , ombudsman , thank you for your report .
i think this is also an effect of continuity in holding office .
the ombudsman , however , must react quicker to the need of citizen .
finally , i would like to pas on a message to the citizen .
madam president , i would like to thank the ombudsman for his work .
that mechanism is not transparent and need to be looked at .
we need a discussion on it in this house .
the legislative process doe not improve poorly drafted legislation .
they simply follow the gesticulation of their party tic-tac men .
the same can not be said for the citizen of europe .
i fully agree with mr paliadeli in this respect .
some of the file we have to make accessible are this thick .
we have to be very careful with this process .
they are absolutely essential for the good working of the single market .
having said that , let me say a few more thing .
i am very glad that the commission also acknowledges that .
a draft recommendation constitutes a finding of maladministration by the ombudsman .
finally , a concern the special report , again a clarification .
the report wa submitted because of the excessive delay .
but again , you have adopted a position on that one .
i think this will result in a better outcome .
i will do my best to see how the website can become user-friendly .
i am convinced that this will be a very important step forward .
it also marked the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon .
mr diamandouros decided to agree to the successive extension requested by the commission .
i do not need to know who complained to whom about what .
i would be happy to work together with you on this .
we will be glad to help you with the cross-referencing table .
this legislation is admittedly technical , which complicates the application process .
for this reason , cooperation is vital between eu institution and national administration .
i fully support the work of the european ombudsman .
the latvian saeima formally elected romāns apsītis a ombudsman .
to promote compliance with the principle of equality and the prevention of discrimination .
in latvia , this exists in the field of education .
to promote the objective review of legal and other issue within reasonable timescales .
to ensure the prevention of deficiency in question concerning infringement of human right .
today in latvia , the word 'ombudsman ' make one smile .
what did the stakeholder say in this round of consultation ?
doe the commission intend to draw up new regulation to cover them ?
it refers to the marketing chain for food product .
although this doe not completely remove the risk , it doe reduce it .
competition policy in the european union ha , hitherto , targeted dishonest business .
every standard consists of patent registered by inventor and business .
a is often the case , this involves a very delicate balance .
i would like to ask something about what you have just said .
do you have any plan to further stimulate competition in the roaming sector ?
we have had quite extensive public consultation on this matter .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:30 and resumed at 12:00 )
fighting colorectal cancer in the european union ( written declaration )
we have reached a majority one month before the deadline .
human right , social and environmental standard in international trade agreement (
a new energy strategy for europe 2011 - 2020 (
like it or not , a decision ha been made by this parliament .
for this reason , i ask that you vote against this amendment .
preparation for cancún climate change conference ( 29 november-10 december ) (
international trade policy in the context of climate change imperative (
( fr ) , and the rest of the paragraph is unchanged .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
secondly , a parliament that take itself seriously must exercise this right .
mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution .
country do not trade with one another : business and individual do .
the whole point of trade is to swap on the back of difference .
it is quite true that we also need commercial channel .
the european union should take note and act accordingly .
we want no more party politics on the rai !
( fi ) mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution .
rape and sexual slavery are the crude everyday reality of war .
this can be seen in war and conflict zone in particular .
insect are not pleasant creature , but we have to cohabit with them .
it ha been a good day for europe with this vote today .
mr president , i voted in favour of this important document .
energy security is certainly one of the key aspect of that strategy .
the eu must foster a common - if not single - energy policy .
europe-wide regulator and institution should be given a greater role .
we therefore mainly have to look to alternative energy form .
i hope that we can gradually stop using coal .
i do not want to see a coalblack future for energy in europe .
if we act accordingly , we will make great progress .
yesterday , i wa talking about the hague court here in parliament .
that ha been very evident in the case of western sahara .
there have been report of numerous case of death , injury and disappearance .
certainly , we were concerned about the recent development in the country .
these country are , after all , leader in co2 emission .
everything should therefore be done to find the proverbial golden mean .
the european parliament must comply with the requirement it ha presented .
we can not be inconsistent when making our own decision .
i am talking here to the farmer in particular .
in the interest of eu citizen , agriculture must be safeguarded financially .
we should have an open discussion about all the option .
parliament need to act firmly in future negotiation , however .
instead of this , an increase of a good 3 % is planned .
i can not support this eu budget for 2011 under any circumstance .
i therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
step need to be taken to make the eu budget more flexible .
it wa the council that insisted on the need for the new treaty .
provision on sustainable development are of benefit to all party .
the future of both european agriculture and european industry are at stake here .
the major energy supplier to europe come under that category .
within our sphere of influence are those state with which we trade .
eu trade agreement must include strong human right , social and environmental standard .
the european union is based on principle that include respect for human right .
the most common type of alleged maladministration were lack of transparency .
the european institution and body must provide citizen with the information they require .
the role of the european administration is vast and complex .
there is often not much sign of this in the european parliament itself .
the same can not be said for the citizen of europe .
the commission receives a particularly high number of complaint from citizen concerning maladministration .
therefore , i do not feel able to pas judgment on him .
in writing . - the ombudsman offer an important service to irish citizen .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
the eu institution normally cooperate very well with the european ombudsman .
therefore , i can only vote in favour of the report .
it is crucial that there is not a repeat of situation like this .
special report are the last resort for the european ombudsman .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
evaluation are a mean , where necessary , of making adjustment .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting .
the provision of relevant data depends on that , of course .
the digital revolution ha created new challenge within this dual system .
it is rare in this chamber to see a public service being defended .
broadcasting represents the main source of information for citizen .
the best example of this is the british broadcaster , the bbc .
free and independent medium are one of the main pillar of democracy .
elsewhere , business structure are having an ever increasing impact on broadcaster .
however , i feel that eu institution could also play a significant role .
i voted in favour of mr belet 's report on public service broadcasting .
the european union is sensitive enough to take such topic into consideration .
reality show u that this is not the case .
woman continue to be discriminated against in many country of the world .
the report address important issue and i therefore voted in favour of it .
i am pleased that this resolution ha been adopted .
i will therefore vote in favour of this motion .
i believe it is important that we concentrate on research into bee population .
i voted in favour of implementing the data survey system by 2012 .
the situation is particularly bad when it come to honey bee .
it therefore make complete sense to step up support for this sector .
we need a coherent european energy strategy that look to the future .
coordinating these plan at eu level would ensure that they are effective .
developing a real european energy strategy ha now become imperative .
the energy sector is a driving force behind economic growth .
scientific research and technology play a key role in achieving these objective .
i voted against the report on the new energy strategy for europe 2011-2020 .
i voted for the resolution on the new energy strategy for europe 2011-2020 .
the european union is currently a major player in the international energy market .
thirdly , trans-european energy infrastructure must be upgraded and modernised .
biomass can play a considerable part in replacing oil and gas .
agriculture can make a significant contribution to achieving the eu 2020 goal .
finally , it bind european energy security into close cooperation with nato .
i voted against it for these and other reason .
on top of that , it advocate close collaboration with nato .
the european union must demonstrate that it ha will and ambition .
today , the union is increasingly dependent on energy import .
in addition , we need to encourage long-term investment on community territory .
the union must also expand research and development effort a much a possible .
energy policy is something very specific from country to country .
for the aforementioned reason , i voted in favour of the document .
concrete commitment could not be reached at the copenhagen conference on climate change .
a far a the objective are concerned , we require more ambition .
it is therefore crucial that concrete commitment and realistic objective are adopted .
climate change is a problem of global relevance and therefore requires joint response .
the scientific argument about climate change and it impact are glaringly obvious .
therefore , we can not fail to monitor it closely and with concern .
that doe not mean that the eu 's ambition should be scaled back .
that is why i am supporting the council and the commission .
i voted against the final adoption of this resolution .
the unrealistic nature of the objective that have been voted on is striking .
today 's vote ha demonstrated that parliament is still unable to do so .
therefore , i would like to see progress at the cancún conference .
this resolution accepts some of the argument made at the cochabamba summit .
one only ha to think of china or india , for example .
i am quite sceptical in relation to the system used to date .
this would simply mean jumping out of the frying pan into the fire .
however , it seems that we may not achieve the target set .
however , climate protection can only succeed if it is carried out globally .
i therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
this is a question of responsibility with regard to future generation .
there have been further serious incident in western sahara recently .
after more than 30 year , the western sahara decolonisation process remains unfinished .
the self-determination of people ha always been a priority for the northern league .
i give my full support to the resolution based on these premise .
this is more than a political issue with a neighbouring state .
i consider the constant interference by morocco to be unacceptable .
it also highlight the effort made and significant advance achieved in recent time .
the ukrainian authority must also make more effort to combat corruption .
further reform are also necessary in order to strengthen medium freedom and pluralism .
state institution are urged to take measure to ensure freedom of the press .
the european union is firmly committed to helping ukraine implement it reform .
in slavonic language , 'ukraine ' mean 'border country ' .
i am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution .
in writing . - i voted for the resolution on ukraine .
the impact of a resolution adopted afterwards will be much weaker .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution on ukraine .
whether ukraine chooses russia or the west is unimportant .
my country , lithuania , also ha a role to play here .
trade policy must play their part in this context .
shutting our eye mean deceiving ourselves most of all .
the eu is far from being the main culprit for this failure .
however , there is still more to be done .
i wa unable to give my support to article 48 , however .
the subsidy also enable diversity in farming and contribute to landscape conservation .
a more pragmatic approach in international negotiation would be a start .
the european union ha to fight these 'traded ' emission .
the report indicates this course of action , so i voted in favour .
it is for that reason that i have voted against this report .
this is the purpose of the resolution that i voted for this week .
foreign investment is a major economic issue for emerging and developing country .
the clause would also allow victim to initiate legal proceeding .
only then is trade liberalisation regarded a something positive and accepted .
this report also seek greater regulation of business by the european union .
it is for that reason that i abstained from voting .
consequently , the european commission ha adopted a pragmatic policy approach .
i have therefore voted in favour of the text .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
clear agreement which ensure stability would therefore be very welcome .
legal certainty should be considered whenever a piece of legislation is reviewed .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
i would plead for three concrete european relief effort for iraqi christian .
the same is true for the christian minority in the plain of nineveh .
on the contrary , it ha exacerbated tension in this country .
you know that the european union fight incessantly against the death penalty .
yet it is not the case of tariq aziz that is important .
nonetheless , in 2009 , 18 country carried out death sentence .
the death penalty ha nothing to do with justice .
unfortunately , she will have to emigrate to another country .
christian in iraq , too , have already fled en masse .
i therefore call on the commission to give this issue top priority .
strong european support is badly needed to moderate group in iraq .
this is a man who is already in prison for life .
the problem with this resolution is that it take account of so little .
one hundred people were taken hostage and 40 died a a result .
in recent year , 900 000 christian have fled iraq .
last monday , two brother were killed in the town of mosul .
attack against religious community are always indefensible everywhere they take place .
the european union is not just concerned about christian .
freedom of religion and conscience must apply to everyone equally .
christian are fleeing iraq , terrified of bombing and massacre .
now , the abuse and oppression is continuing against christian .
there must be an end to abuse and oppression in iraq .
we must not send iraqi people back to certain suffering and oppression .
discrimination , of whatever kind , can not be tolerated .
that is the direct answer to mr de lange .
humanitarian assistance also continues to reach the most vulnerable inside and outside iraq .
we do not underestimate the challenge facing the iraqi government .
security , development and the preservation of human right are closely linked .
we must continue to fight for them to stay alive and be free .
tibet - plan to make chinese the main language of instruction
of course , genuine bilingualism is an important objective .
madam president , i am opposed to this resolution .
i did not say that you should believe the chinese ambassador .
that is about reconfirming our value , mr bütikofer .
the overall situation in tibet is one of those where we differ .
the remoteness of tibetan area doe not make this task any easier .
the eu is ready to share it expertise , should china so decide .
madam president , we sometimes have good news , even in emergency situation .
she ha already been freed before and then put under house arrest again .
before the election , law were voted in to repress freedom of expression .
people should not live in small or big prison for their thought .
for this reason , further pressure is needed from the international community .
however , this is not going to be an easy process .
madam president , let u begin with the election .
the european union should not , therefore , lower it guard .
a wa stated earlier , the whole country is like an open prison .
that is why we now need to be very critical and vigilant .
this change can be regarded a an acid test .
the slogan 'release the political prisoner ' therefore still stand in burma .
it is to her that chinese dissident are already appealing .
election must be synonymous with the choice that one express through a vote .
their resolve to seize what they saw a an opportunity wa commendable .
election in themselves do not make a country democratic .
human right aspect are built into our aid programme .
however , we should not ease our stance against the military junta .
the release of aung san suu kyi is a positive .
currently , more than 1 000 'political prisoner ' are still being held .

i would like to make some preliminary remark before our sitting .
voting on the report is planned to take place on wednesday .
the international community achieved a certain amount of progress in cancún .
a you will remember , the winner is the cuban dissident guillermo fariñas .
we still hope that our prize winner will manage to reach u .
thousand of opposition activist were arrested and over 100 people lost their life .
i have already informed mr bloom of my decision .
signature of act adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
after one year , i think we can fully exercise this right .
all parliament 's right are met in this report .
i ask for the support of all the other group .
however , we have no objection to this topic being on the agenda .
the deadline for tabling amendment will be 10:00 on wednesday .
i do not see anyone who want to speak against .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
this programme can provide them with work while offering them appropriate assistance .
the strategy envisaged undertaking to extend and support nutrition education among child .
another major issue is food advertising aimed at child .
however , i wa surprised to see that precisely the opposite is happening .
i must stress that the opposite economic policy applies in the united state .
pakistani law therefore fuel this climate of persecution and unjust death .
however , while their obligation are equal , their entitlement are not .
unfortunately , this type of natural disaster is becoming increasingly frequent .
i also called for the european commission to be consistent .
it will be a major test and a challenge for hungary .
in conclusion , continued support for the peace programme is absolutely essential .
( ga ) mr president , this is a very important question .
the dairy market in ireland alone is worth eur 1 billion annually .
i am disappointed that those problem are not going to be dealt with .
it mean the pilot who test the aircraft during flight .
this concept wa recently invented by the latvian airline airbaltic .
recently , airbaltic ha registered a very large number of emergency .
the referendum is scheduled to take place on 9 january next .
only then will the bank be able to be held accountable .
that is slightly unfortunate , because this surreal situation is worth mentioning .
there are therefore two important point to be raised .
of course , these agreement are also of interest at the regional level .
madam commissioner , i very much look forward to your response .
we should therefore proceed with great caution when it come to visa policy .
thank you for placing this very important debate on the agenda .
you also made reference to the programme for pakistan .
it is one of the eight visa facilitation agreement that we have concluded .
it is also an important agreement in quantitative term .
that is more than a quarter of all schengen visa issued worldwide .
however , there are some shortcoming , a were referred to .
these have to be assessed on an individual basis according to our legislation .
the authority of these two country have taken some step .
there have been new information campaign organised to inform the citizen .
free movement is one road to learning democracy and seeing it at work .
the people-to-people direct contact mean sharing value and reality .
we have seen cooperation in these country in this area .
serbia , by the way , ha done so very quickly and efficiently .
i hope that all group will find that reassuring and adequate .
that is the reason we support visa facilitation and visa waiver .
there have been problem , but the commission is on the case .
however , we have some reservation on the agreement on readmission .
and now some word on the visa agreement with russia .
this is also essential for tourism , which is developing strongly recently .
i wish the commission success in implementing it all .
serbia and macedonia are the forerunner of bosnia and albania .
this mechanism could also function in the opposite direction .
all these measure can help reduce the incidence of these activity .
they are playing on the fear and ignorance of our citizen .
secondly , those asylum seeker were almost exclusively member of ethnic minority .
russia ha changed enormously since the time of the former soviet union .
the visa-free regime is not about asylum for political or economic reason .
the responsibility continues to lie with the authority of the region .
let u not put that at stake in a european perspective .
the russian authority have repeatedly requested that the short-stay visa requirement be lifted .
resolving the conflict in transnistria is a political priority for my country .
it must fully respect international law and the republic of moldova 's sovereignty .
the visa procedure should weigh heavily on our conscience .
a a citizen of poland , i visited your country in 1976 .
this tell u that something , somewhere , ha gone wrong .
they sometimes come to the eu in order to work and to live .
it lead to poverty wage rate , unsafe condition , exploitation and abuse .
let u treat the visa regime also a a tool to promote democracy .
we can not abolish visa unless we have very strict criterion .
overall , i think that this wa a very good debate .
of course , i did not want one immediately a regard pakistan .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 14 december .
i firmly believe that the serbian authority will respond promptly .
we must not count our chicken before they are hatched .
that is more than a quarter of all schengen visa issued worldwide .
creation of an immigration liaison officer ' network ( debate )
the support they have given me ha improved this report .
and what make more effective management of immigration process necessary ?
what it doe is it make a mockery of the whole system .
i support elected politician in the uk having control over our own border .
what i do not support are unaccountable , unelected appointee .
it is bad and it is putting people out of work .
that way , illegal immigration is not combated , but actively encouraged .
we have created the immigration liaison officer ' network .
have no doubt that we shall support all such initiative on your part .
i therefore consider cooperation between these officer and frontex to be urgently necessary .
some member state proceed with great vigour , while others are very sluggish .
naturally , this then ha negative implication for all the member state .
what is embodied in this report is a caricature of the european parliament .
i do not want to manage it : i want to stop it .
that is what we have been doing for the last six decade .
this is also a task for the asylum support office .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 14 december .
single application procedure for residence and work ( debate )
these challenge are demographic decline and the ageing of europe 's population .
let u take care , however , and not deceive ourselves .
now , the link between the two is obvious .
moreover , this directive will simplify admission procedure for employment purpose .
we know that well-managed migratory flow will be of benefit to everyone .
a mr mathieu said , this is a compromise .
a a result , residence and work permit are being combined into one .
well , how much progress have we made to date ?
parliament must therefore vote against what is called the 'single permit ' directive .
accepting this would violate the principle of the charter of fundamental right .
equality can not be summed up by merely invoking working condition .
equality must involve all worker , whatever their origin .
i believe the one can not exist without the other .
this , i believe , raise the issue of equal treatment .
there is also the question of the illogicality of where we are today .
we will present these amendment again tomorrow on behalf of our group .
we want to treat everyone who life and work here fairly and equally .
basically , the great difficulty here is what to do .
we are not , i think , at all equal to the challenge .
i believe that the issue call for a more subtle approach .
the success of multiculturalism presupposes tolerance , mutual respect and solidarity .
a new , but extremely negative situation will be created .
why can the commission not apply the same rule to all employee ?
the guiding principle here must surely be equal treatment for all .
how can you suggest that it is not guaranteed ?
i would like to reiterate my personal regard for mr oomen-ruijten .
it still is , so we therefore have this sectoral approach .
the directive is necessary because we have third-country worker .
they are in our country and make an important contribution to our economy .
i share your view that we need to protect them .
the commission is about to launch an impact assessment study on the issue .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 14 december 2010 .
i am very grateful to the council , too .
however , this wa strongly opposed by the council .
he ha done a fantastic job together with his team of shadow rapporteur .
parliament , the commission and the council have really achieved an agreement .
i would really like to thank you for that .
thank you all , again , for your contribution .
that is what i wanted to say by way of introduction .
migrant who come to our country are a considerable asset to our economy .
we can not , however , welcome everybody under any condition .
several government have realised in recent month that their integration model ha failed .
the council wanted to take a different approach , which i find regrettable .
i am pleased that parliament will now adopt this report .
we all have the same deadline to meet and that is 2012 .
otherwise , the word 'solidarity ' will soon become meaningless .
mamuth is 26 year old and come from eritrea .
there are , however , a few difficulty in this report .
this will then apply throughout the territory of the eu .
i believe it will get strong support tomorrow in the vote .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 14 december 2010 .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
the cohesion policy 's role in the eu 2020 strategy is unarguable .
the cohesion policy play a vital role in the application of multi-level governance .
this is precisely why this approach should also become compulsory .
we need a common definition of the concept of partnership .
that will also contribute to further internal cohesion in europe .
this will make a very important contribution to ensuring growth .
yes , it is important to develop multi-level governance .
multi-level governance is a prerequisite for achieving territorial cohesion and boosting it potential .
neither do we want an additional burden for the beneficiary .
a the commissioner said , regional policy is nothing le than investment policy .
this is something that we also need to strive for in the future .
cohesion policy is not actually just a matter of solidarity .
we have had some disappointing result a regard implementation figure , for example .
we do not feel that is appropriate for the current situation .
on his behalf , i present this to you .
this should be supported even if we only take into account economic consideration .
in other word , it is cohesion for competitiveness .
to this i would like to add the regional level .
that represents a commitment by the member state to real partnership .
the commission is promoting initiative in favour of regional and local authority .
cohesion policy can make a significant contribution to this .
if country want to leave , they have the right to do so .
only in this way will we achieve the goal of true territorial cohesion .
this objective need to be brought into play more in the future .
i believe that the europe 2020 strategy must promote a sustainable development plan .
this report is important because it mention the cohesion policy 's achievement .
in this regard , at national level , there were ...
if they have no alternative to offer , then they should keep quiet .
the same could be applied to the european union in term of development .
in principle , however , i am absolutely with you .
we have come up with specific proposal , commissioner .
all you need to do is give them serious consideration .
at this stage , i see no point in talking of common measure .
the measure for each member state must differ , because their need differ .
this money could certainly be reallocated to a new intermediate category of region .
i congratulate mr luhan on his work on the report .
the report support a further simplification of both legislative and non-legislative regulation .
the support provided by cohesion policy must be concentrated in three main direction .
this mean that we must continue to ease the administrative burden .
the concept is often quoted but rarely put into action in concrete term .
for example , we should pay special attention to border region .
lastly , we need to work on new performance indicator .
the development challenge that region face are linked to their own local constraint .
impact of advertising on consumer behaviour ( short presentation )
mr president , lady and gentleman , why a report on advertising ?
firstly , because advertising nowadays is not what it used to be .
that is a considerable increase in online trade and online advertising tool .
doe anyone here want or accept their private email being read ?
well , that is what happens today for the purpose of advertising .
an adult might understand this , but a child doe not .
well , new technology brings new challenge : considerable economic challenge .
we see that basically , this is really a political debate .
the second problem is the sheer number of trademark .
all type of advertisement should be expressly prohibited in child 's programme .
to conclude , i once again congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur .
at the same time , there is a dilemma in assessing it .
the directive nevertheless contains specific safeguard concerning vulnerable consumer .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12:30 .
consumer , especially the youngest consumer , must be protected from hidden advertising .
fundamentally , we must ensure the integrity of our financial market .
inflation is actually stimulated by derivative financial market product .
it could therefore be established whether an adequate flow of trade is maintained .
on 8 december , the commission published draft proposal for a consultation .
we intend to be ambitious and comprehensive in tackling all challenge .
this report reinforces the basis for our work ahead .
the agenda ha been published and is available on the european parliament website .
what we need to do now is to put the charter into practice .
i am pleased to see that m gál 's report support this approach .
i welcome the call in the report for improved cooperation among the institution .
so thing are moving quickly and they are moving well .
i also fully share the objective of ensuring smooth cooperation with international organisation .
we do this a a matter of course , on a daily basis .
i consider three area contained in the report to be of key importance .
i would like to come back to four message contained in this report .
however , using flowery language will not be enough .
civil and political right are no more important than economic and social right .
the situation regarding the rom people is unfortunately symptomatic of this .
for this , i would like to thank her .
i should like to raise a few minor point regarding the implementation itself .
all the measure have a precise objective : to value human dignity .
have we learnt nothing from the second world war ?
it is still unclear exactly what turn thing will take in this respect .
member state must abide by the charter 's provision when applying eu legislation .
they provide a guarantee for individual right in member state .
the keyword is implementation , which must be rapid and effective for victim .
poland 's opt-out from the charter ha no substantive justification .
unfortunately , even the constitutional tribunal in poland doe not always understand this .
the report is based on the charter of fundamental right .
mr gál 's report is a significant milestone along this road .
the combination of different form of combating discrimination may lead to discrimination .
we see how the actual concept of discrimination go beyond it definition .
i am therefore calling for democratic control of this institution .
( hu ) mr president , the rapporteur ha done an excellent job .
the gender pay gap in the eu stand at about 18 % .
urgent measure are therefore needed to combat these discriminatory situation .
preferential treatment for certain complainant is not fitting conduct for a neutral judge .
violation of the fundamental right of citizen can not remain without consequence .
this seems to me to be the most important element .
i have voted in favour of kinga gál 's initiative .
i offer my total support and the gratitude of 335 000 people .
i do not believe that europe can give these up in the future .
we are also talking about preventive measure from a different source .
are 2 500 woman every year not a security problem for europe ?
let u not invoke the law just when it suit u .
we have been working on the procedural right for person who are accused .
the draft directive change the limited , territorial aspect of these protection measure .
parliament 's desire is for victim ' protection to be extended .
we are therefore awaiting the package with eagerness and interest in spring 2011 .
i would also have liked this order to have incorporated two issue .
i fully support the aim and objective of this proposal .
we have a saying in england : 'once bitten , twice shy ' .
we have been bitten once by the european arrest warrant .
i suggest that we shy away from the european protection order .
it is important that the directive should be applied over a wide area .
it should not involve any sort of legal hairsplitting .
the victim of this european legal anarchy are often small , innocent child .
i hope this problem will be resolved by the european protection order .
this is not the only area where greater awareness is necessary .
i have two question for mr reding and the rapporteur .
madam president , i would like also to thank the rapporteur .
we can not just go ahead and put our idea on paper .
all our proposal must be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment .
that is what we are doing at the moment .
it ha been rejected on the basis of subsidiarity .
we are in the middle of a very complicated issue .
violence affect a child 's normal , harmonious development .
there are new trend in trafficking in human being .
the lisbon treaty gave u a new legal basis - article 83 .
they are being forced into prostitution , forced labour or begging .
human trafficking is currently the fastest growing cross-border crime .
however , it is not enough to punish the perpetrator .
protection for victim of human trafficking must also improve .
if we can reduce demand , then access to service will also reduce .
this mean that we must deal with those who make human trafficking profitable .
the same principle ought to apply to individual who exploit victim .
unfortunately , we did not succeed in getting this proposal accepted .
i think we can be satisfied with the agreement that we have today .
this is , indeed , a good christmas present .
there are several example of the european parliament helping to improve the directive .
a i said , we have all done very good work together .
human trafficking is a reprehensible phenomenon in today 's civilised society .
the european parliament play an important role here a joint lawmaker .
we must adopt preventive measure targeting human trafficking itself .
how do we ensure that victim really can build a new life ?
now , that question ha not been sufficiently regulated by this directive .
it ha a broad area of application relating to human trafficking .
perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this .
i think we have put together a good document today .
for that reason , i fully support the present report .
that seems to me to be an unfortunate state of affair .
standard eu legislation and a minimum term of imprisonment of 10-15 year .
i think it will be the most effective measure we have ever taken .
madam president , this is no ordinary day for parliament .
it is a very proud day for the whole parliament .
we need to be more restrained in this regard .
we should therefore tread very carefully where this is concerned .
i am also mentioning this in view of the imminent european investigation order .
i am pleased that we have now taken this step .
we talk about pimp and brothel-keepers a entrepreneur , and we normalise prostitution .
it is a very important tool for fighting trafficking and protecting the victim .
we have much work to do in combating demand .
a i said earlier , we must not give up .
the vote will take place today , in a few minute .
furthermore , a hostile environment must be created for human trafficker .
i therefore voted in favour of this legislative initiative .
we can not allow the trafficking and subsequent auctioning of child to continue .
this will be binding legislation , subject to state enforcement .
fighting demand is key to fighting the root of trafficking .
victim can be woman or men , child or adult .
an employee on a construction site could be a victim of human trafficking .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few minute )
you are therefore very welcome to the european parliament .

regulation of trading in financial instrument - 'dark pool ' , etc . (
yes , mr speroni , they are looking into what is happening .
however , can you see it on your small screen ?
but my colleague will return to this after a discussion in the college .
consequently , the proposal shall be sent back to the commission .
therefore , the proposal is not automatically sent back to the responsible committee .
we have already been negotiating this text for a year .
we went to plenary with agreement that had not been honoured .
for a year now , we have failed to reach an agreement .
so , what is the point of starting all over again ?
we have tried everything possible and you have never agreed with anyone .
i will certainly put it on the table of the college .
the commission will inform you later of the outcome of it discussion .
that is what she said ; we will see what happens next .
for now , the commission is not withdrawing the proposal .
mr president , there are two of u who are rapporteur .
we will see if they support this initiative now .
eu-georgia agreement on readmission of person residing without authorisation (
i wonder what kind of europe we are heading towards .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
we will now proceed to the explanation of vote .
in the 1970s , we used to talk about picking winner .
what we are actually doing here is picking loser .
you were a brilliantly successful conservative leader in catalonia .
my country , lithuania , ha always had a special relationship with georgia .
there wa always huge public support for this country .
they include democracy , human right and freedom of opinion .
it is these that we especially need to uphold .
mr president , human trafficking is a very serious issue .
woman and child are in the special risk group .
prostitution and the trade in organ are the most glaring example of this .
the idea of cohesion is therefore one whose significance can not be overestimated .
these are the reason why i voted in favour of this report .
competitiveness and cohesion are element which complement and support one another .
the solidarity fund is contributing about eur 31 million .
forty-two people died and 13 disappeared in the disaster that struck madeira .
nonetheless , we would like to reiterate some remark here .
i voted for the mobilisation of the european solidarity fund .
the storm claimed 53 life and nearly 80 people were injured .
the material damage wa estimated at eur 1 425.43 million .
the european union solidarity fund is the ideal instrument for supporting local effort .
the eu solidarity fund wa established to precisely this end .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the report .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
more than 100 000 people from latvia have already left their native country .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the effect of the economic crisis are still being felt throughout europe .
then , admittedly , came two or three financially difficult year .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund wa created to respond to situation like these .
i voted in favour of the aid to aragón .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund wa created to respond to situation like these .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund wa created to respond to situation like these .
therefore , other measure urgently need to be adopted .
on this basis , financial assistance should be provided on an individual basis .
the crisis ha led to a 28 % decline in vehicle registration .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the fund provides an annual amount of eur 500 million for such case .
given this , financial assistance should be provided on an individual basis .
the commission proposed mobilising eur 114 250 and i support the proposal .
every individual ha the right to be treated humanely .
for these reason , i voted against the report .
europe now ha a duty to the country in this region .
these agreement are also beneficial at a regional level .
the south caucasus is of strategic importance to the european union .
i consider mr saakashvili to be a war criminal .
his regime is responsible for the death of thousand of innocent civilian .
an agreement with georgia would bring a wave of bogus asylum seeker .
thus , we first need to dispel our security concern .
the problem with the schengen information system ii must also be resolved beforehand .
what we need is a true 'rapid response capability ' .
it is essential that the response should be of this kind .
in writing . - i welcome this report which :
the economic cost of such disaster is also much greater in these country .
natural cataclysm will occur ever more frequently a a result of climate change .
it is for that reason that i voted against this report .
another example is the recent large-scale environmental accident which occurred in hungary .
there is also a duty of solidarity between eu member state .
it is for that reason that i voted against this report .
today , we have parliament 's response to that problem .
work is continuing in the field of financial regulation .
until this happens , any other policy will be merely cosmetic .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
data acquisition cost in europe are much too high .
they are sometimes ten time higher than they are in the united state .
the report contains some good proposal for reducing these and other unnecessary cost .
it is for that reason that i abstained from voting .
understanding the market dynamic and equipping regulator with instrument plus information/data is vital .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
i voted for this report which set out such a coordinated approach .
at present , the latter pose a serious threat to our fellow citizen .
these are all inconsistency that prevent me from voting for this text .
it is also important to address the risk of proliferation by terrorist .
the urgent establishment of a european crisis response mechanism is also necessary .
finally , european quality and security standard should also be adopted .
this report is a little note of explanation , not an action plan .
such work can require several year , but it must be carried out .
moreover , the report appears to deal predominantly with the subject of solidarity .
that is what we intend to do with the adoption of this report .
european union cohesion policy is the principle mean of ensuring sustainable regional development .
consequently , conservative meps have abstained on the final vote .
however , this audit role of the european commission need to be enhanced .
we still disagree with and oppose some aspect of the report .
the 2008 report confirmed this data with 11 % of fund unduly reimbursed .
overly complex rule governing the structural fund are partly responsible for these error .
this text act a a foil to the creation of european macro-regions .
a a result , there will be fewer gap between level of competitiveness .
this information is kept in great secrecy from the people of latvia .
regional authority have therefore found themselves in direct contact with the european institution .
the decentralisation of government brings increased responsibility to regional and local authority .
we should support a grass-roots approach , which should be flexible and integrated .
it is important for cohesion policy to be user friendly .
i am thinking , here , of innovative measure .
this wa not a matter addressed in the original regulation adopted in 2004 .
the european institution will have to make good their commitment .
this can only be effectively combated in the transit country .
that is how a year of precious work ha been wasted .
people must realise that the european parliament is not subordinate to the council .
this is contrary to equal treatment and is not acceptable .
however , it is necessary to maintain our vigilance .
you have to admit that there is something obscene about that .
appropriate step must be taken to counteract these problem effectively .
for this reason , i agree with the rapporteur 's position .
this report and the draft directive that it amends are shameful .
i shall vote against it and i also condemn it .
it wa thus a step forward , for two reason .
we need such a set of rule for at least two reason .
secondly , such clear rule would help achieve better control over migration .
legal immigration into eu member state is important for economic development .
this should simplify the complex administrative formality involved in the reception of migrant .
the european union must prepare itself for future demographic challenge .
i am in favour of the general idea of the protection order .
i am aware of the complexity of this initiative .
in writing . - i welcome the european protection order .
the epo mark a huge step forward in victim right .
over 100 000 woman in the eu are covered by protective measure .
for these reason , the ecr group abstained on this report .
it wa with this intention that we adopted these new rule today .
his or her dignity a a human being must also be considered .
nevertheless , the member state must be encouraged to continue along these line .
i am grateful to the rapporteur for his report .
a clear deadline ha been set for execution of an order ;
the eu also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking .
the eu is actually part of the problem , not the solution .
victim are priced , sold or bartered , and stripped of their dignity .
i welcome the adoption of this proposal and of new penalty .
we therefore need to carry out specific study to discover it true extent .
the eu also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking .
the eu is actually part of the problem , not the solution .
secondly , our text establishes sanction and minimum penalty for trafficker .
time ha proven that the existing framework wa not effective enough .
trafficking in human being is a modern form of slavery .
this text is the first binding european legislation on the subject .
it strengthens both protection for victim and sanction against perpetrator .
is this the job of a member of the european parliament ?
only a combination of different measure can ultimately achieve the goal .
meanwhile , the head of the begging mafia are living in luxury villa .
however , some of the proposed measure go too far .
i thus agree with the european parliament proposal to create an anti-trafficking coordinator .
in romania , approximately 780 victim were registered in 2009 .
i am therefore delighted with the result of this historic vote .
the problem with the schengen information system ii must also finally be resolved .
this policy brings u closer to a more 'sustainable ' european economy .
urban and rural area play a dynamic role in regional economic development .
this report is primarily concerned with regional and european competitiveness and increased productivity .
it is completely in line with the europe 2020 strategy .
consequently , in future , the partnership principle must be significantly strengthened .
when we talk about cohesion in this parliament , we talk about wish-lists .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is question time with the president of the commission .
i would like to welcome president barroso to our monthly question time .
president of the commission . - the situation in gaza is not tenable .
i recently received prime minister fayyad and we spoke about this .
gaza should be viewed a a very important component of palestinian state-building .
i would like to ask you the following question :
president of the commission . - eurobonds are an interesting idea .
there is reluctance on the part of several member state regarding that proposal .
i have a specific question on the 2009 discharge .
it will only divide the euro area and the european union .
what is more , efsa itself ha decided to issue new assessment guideline .
new assessment and authorisation renewal should be processed according to the new rule .
we do not have a better alternative to efsa .
this is an independent agency which wa set up to provide opinion .
we are therefore going to continue abiding by community law on this subject .
the commission can not decide to suspend the application of community law .
however , this is the system that i am obliged to adhere to .
that is a much a i can tell you at this stage .
the commission is indeed following the issue of nord stream very closely .
mr barroso , remember : we have discussed this before here .
we do not have one ; we have a president of the commission .
colleague , i am sorry we are not taking comment from the floor .
we would like to go ahead with the proceeding .
china enjoys a large surplus on it balance of trade with the eu .
europe 's surplus in service is too small to compensate for this .
china is rapidly accumulating foreign currency reserve and control over scarce global resource .
european country must individually - my preference - or collectively protect our industry .
by the way , this wa quite clearly expressed at the last summit .
what we have is biased trade in favour of china .
we are doing that and we are very committed to reciprocity above all .
the concept of reciprocity mean that we want to keep market open .
we now come to the second part of question hour , catch-the-eye .
the president of the commission ha given fulsome answer on wikileaks .
this is very much on the agenda and in our financial perspective .
in june , we will make some concrete proposal on this issue .
following that , i have another question regarding the campaign against julian assange .
with regard to julian assange , i have no comment to make .
mr berlusconi is described a mr putin 's spokesman in europe .
both sweden and the united kingdom respect the rule of law .
we have to let the normal process of law go on .
i can not , therefore , comment on that .
the comment are attributed to united state diplomat and are therefore their responsibility .
regarding accusation against a specific person , i am not a tribunal .
she is developing this kind of action with our main partner .
are we facing the threat of an orwellian total censorship of the internet ?
that is the danger , and we need answer on this matter .
this leaf the eu open to the charge of hypocrisy .
in the meantime , a proper cyber war is raging .
you have already mentioned the activity of commissioner malmström .
we have put proposal on the table to enhance cyber security .
thus , here , too , it is a question of environmental responsibility .
we green are not satisfied with what we have achieved up to now .
this ha not been a walk in the park .
to be honest , this level of cut could be considered somewhat populist .
it is also important that we achieve some measure of progress .
the compromise that we wanted with the council were rejected .
moreover , the cut would then be made in connection with cohesion policy .
in this respect , parliament ha achieved a major success .
we have negotiated hard and in a highly controversial manner .
on this issue , it ha sided with parliament .
i would also like to address my fellow member in that regard .
i would like to compliment you greatly on your work .
the alde group would like a solution to be found to this .
one month later , where are we on this ?
my group proposes to adopt the budget a agreed by the council .
it offer a small increase and that is a reasonable compromise .
unfortunately , the debate on the budget had a false start .
the parliament ha a right to advise , not a right to codecide .
the parliament lost this battle , a we predicted .
the hothead here must cool down , particularly the green .
is that the image you want to offer the financial market ?
first , a few word on the budget itself .
however , the final commitment is a weak one .
moreover , these same government also want to reduce flexibility .
others instead will complain that this is not enough .
of course we will not vote in favour of this budget a increased .
european tax : a reason for a celebratory cocktail !
fortunately , though , there is a cause for celebration .
the budget increase ha been capped , after heavy pressure from member state .
some people want this , but the majority say 'no ' .
for u social democrat , there are two issue here .
but look at those member state who are really having problem now .
will the european parliament have a joint deciding role in this ?
my question about this is : is an eu tax part of that ?
the best example of this is the european globalisation adjustment fund .
europe is financing it ambition by indulging in word .
in 2010 , the union ha redefined it notion of financial solidarity .
2011 must be the year in which we reinvent budgetary solidarity .
there is no reason for u to have a provisional budget .
household , business and local authority also need this certainty .
parliament initially presented a very strongly united front in maintaining it position .
we are currently in the position of agreeing on figure .
a a result , there is a lack of funding for iter .
that work need to be recognised , a doe that of the council .
from my perspective , this new procedure need fine-tuning .
they are very small , but my concern are for the future .
i hope that that will not actually come to pas .
for this reason , i would like to thank all our negotiator .
our parliament now ha a joint decision-making power in budgetary matter .
this issue of own resource will resurface in the coming month .
in national economy across europe , we have austerity measure and budget cut .
this codecision procedure ha functioned ; it ha worked .
i believe that you really must seize this opportunity .
i think that we really must promote this logic .
there is a lack of discussion and a lack of understanding .
we must hold joint debate on this increasingly dramatic divergence .
in that case , he will probably understand this now .
rather , the goal is to find an intelligent financing system .
the council and parliament should be prepared to do that .
what is the global role of the european union in the coming year ?
this will ensure financial security for the vulnerable agriculture sector .
at the time , european supervision of this type wa legally impossible .
anyway , thank you for your fruitful and effective collaboration in this area .
alternatively , it might be the user of rating who pay .
this wa a point that i very much insisted on .
the united state and the g20 have already gone in that direction .
i would like to make one more comment on this .
i am pleased that article 8a and 8b were removed during the trialogue .
initially , the commission 's draft proposed creating secure website .
that is an important and positive step in the right direction .
thus , the appointment of esma remains the only real and positive change .
my view is that the remit should be defined very clearly .
i made this point myself in my speech just now .
for u , this is a question of efficiency .
we will take these idea into account in the new consultation phase .
i think that that would also be a guarantee .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 15 december 2010 ) .
it main power will be to supervise agency of this kind .
outcome of the climate change conference in cancún ( debate )
i think that this should definitely be highlighted and underlined .
the climate summit in cancún ha ultimately been a success .
perhaps i could briefly highlight a number of thing ?
we have adopted a framework and established a committee .
support will be provided for both mitigation and adaptation .
in addition , there have been effort to ensure greater transparency .
a you all now know , that is what we got .
we worked very hard , together with the mexican presidency .
a year ago , we took the first step in copenhagen .
but in cancún , we also took new step .
we strengthened the international climate regime with new institution and new fund .
we had three priority which we wanted to be reflected in the result .
that is very important and i would like to add one further point .
this wa actually a very important and significant step forward .
we have a long and challenging journey to make .
we saw in cancún how slow the process is .
the year ahead of u is a very challenging one .
all must now take action , a we are doing in europe .
we were discussing earlier in this forum how important that is .
mr president , i would like to endorse the congratulating of commissioner hedegaard .
our common goal is to limit global warming to the celebrated 2 ºc .
we have a responsibility with regard to technology transfer .
we proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax to finance this .
we must take the hot air out of the eu 's carbon footprint .
my final point is this : this climate conference is done .
where is the mention of curbing the rise in temperature by 2015 ?
where is the ambition to cut co2 emission by 50 % by 2050 ?
fudged and dodged and kicked into the long grass .
there are some very difficult question to be answered a we go forward .
in my group , the ecr , we believe in light-touch government .
the measure of agreement reached in cancún is a step in that direction .
the expectation of cancún were extremely low and it wa therefore a success .
we share one planet and we have no future unless we work together .
in any case , cancún officially endorsed the emission commitment made at copenhagen .
we can be more ambitious and take medium- and long-term measure .
the conference in cancún showed that the un can indeed deliver result .
we have now promised a reduction of 20 % by 2020 .
we have a crucial year in front of u ahead of durban .
so i have a very simple question for the commissioner .
it is clear that negotiating is a huge and complex task .
it is a real challenge when there are so many different position .
i think all of you here know what the process is now .
m del castillo mentioned that cancún ha learned from copenhagen .
in the last hour there , i sat with a check list .
for this reason , we opted for a number of balanced partial agreement .
no decision ha been reached about such an agreement in cancún .
in fact , some country would rather have the protocol itself abolished .
it resembles nothing so much a the dancing procession of echternach .
meanwhile , the global warming clock quietly tick on .
europe is a role model when it come to climate .
there wa significant progress with regard to technology , forest and adaptation .
in particular , i welcome the creation of a climate fund .
cancún 's success lay in the fact that political pride wa saved .
it wa agreed that there would be an agreement .
let u get back to a sensible , comprehensive policy of environmental protection .
the next item is question time ( b7-0655/2010 ) .
woman are at risk of losing their job faster than men .
in addition , it is not uncommon for woman to lack social cover .
this is why the commission developed european guideline on breast cancer screening .
( lt ) i would also like to check something .
are high quality health care service accessible to woman living in poverty ?
but health and poverty are interrelated ; this is not gender based .
healthcare system are suffering a great deal due to the economic crisis .
would the commission please outline the action taken on this resolution ?
this investigative tool lie outside of the scope of the data retention directive .
we also need to foster greater labour mobility and encourage innovation .
this situation got worse after the international monetary fund had become involved .
so the question is this : why this low take-up rate in greece ?
briefly , this is a very important , if sad , topic .
we will pay attention to this and connect that with labour market trend .
what other measure doe it intend to take , notably to combat stereotype ?
that is why we need to speak with those who have responsibility .
i knew that this wa one of your favourite subject .
in addition , there is also this 17 % gender pay gap .
who is going to care for the elderly , too ?
i completely agree with the figure which have been quoted .
i would like to thank the commissioner for her answer a well .
so this will provide a basic benefit for million of european citizen .
imagine that you are travelling from strasbourg to a neighbouring country .
on 9 november , the commission published the 2010 progress report on turkey .
this will affect the overall progress of the negotiation .
( de ) mr president , i would like to apologise .
i thought that it would last half an hour , a scheduled .
i realise that there are difficulty but question time started 20 minute late .
unresolved issue concerning cyprus still being divided is one of them .
i am also pursuing a number of route for intensifying this process .
in view of the above , will the commission say :
is it aware of the specific event outlined above ?
is it concerned about the rise in fanatical nationalism ?
will it make appropriate representation to the albanian government to tackle this problem ?
the annual allocation for the croatia-serbia cross-border programme amount to eur 1.8 million .
project beneficiary include municipality , ngo , chamber of commerce or cultural institution .
a for the second question , if i may continue .
in this question , the honourable member also provides detail of other incident .
in it recent opinion the commission commented positively on inter-ethnic relation in albania .
( de ) mr president , thank you very much for your generosity .
that really would be extremely important for the whole region .
mr paleckis , would you like to make a comment about belarus ?
thank you for your present on the eve of christmas .
i think we have seen some limited progress in this pre-election process .
we are very keen to see the report of the osce/odihr monitoring mission .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:40 and resumed at 21:00 )
there is too little focus on innovation and on achieving result .
target will be set in relation to the 2050 road map .
building are absolutely crucial in energy and climate policy .
forty percent of energy consumption come from our building .
if we do not take action , we will not meet the target .
the level of consumption referred to there is well-known .
twenty percent - of how much , we do not know .
we want to produce these by february or march .
then we need to ask : where do we start ?
first of all , in the area of building stock .
we therefore need more energy efficiency in the area of transport .
thirdly , there is industry and , fourthly , the energy sector .
not everything it contains is of equal importance , either .
however , i would like to emphasise two point once again .
secondly , we have also pointed out the problem with the definition .
it is also a key element of our energy strategy .
for this to happen , several problem need to be resolved .
in term of the future , we are not clairvoyant .
this technology will allow u to achieve our goal .
it is also important to take regional difference into account .
the question is : how do we achieve this goal ?
have we really achieved more and had more of an effect ?
why and in which area have we been using energy more efficiently ?
how differently is it implemented in the member state ?
what matter is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstance .
it saddens me that we have not achieved more .
perhaps we need to choose a different approach for that reason .
there have also been area of disagreement , however .
at the same time , we have seen that binding target do work .
it is therefore obvious that this should also apply to energy efficiency measure .
it would also create many thousand of job in the local economy .
i am a little surprised at the debate that we are having here .
this problem doe not have to do with the definition of energy efficiency .
we are told that we do not need a binding objective .
they are paying very high price for their energy .
citizen will be confronted with a two-fold increase in energy price .
in my speech , i would like to focus on one issue .
firstly , it is important for u to set binding target .
we have to depend , unfortunately in this case , on political will .
in my opinion , that is the way to boost energy efficiency .
who know how much oil and gas we import in europe ?
who know how much oil and gas we extract in europe ?
by importing oil and gas , we are actually exporting money .
we must , of course , be a smart a possible .
how are we to measure the target that the commissioner mentioned ?
i think we should stop doing that and we should support mr bendtsen .
above all , the approach to this issue can be technology-neutral .
such campaign are the kind of thing that alienate the citizen .
the biggest saving are to be made if we consume even le energy .
they have to be adapted to make them more energy efficient .
they will not have to spend so much on energy .
now , that is an argument that you hardly ever hear .
ultimately , however , ordinary people will have to spend le on energy .
in the report being discussed , we can see similarly over-optimistic assumption .
it can do this on it own and produce a high social return .
it is important that we chart the path forward .
the commission and the rapporteur are taking the right approach in this regard .
we therefore also have to be active at that level .
it will be kind on both the environment and the wallet .
commissioner , you have indicated that you will be working in two stage .
a great deal more could be done with those fund .
i believe that we have to spend in order to save .
country such a china have been waiting for the outcome from cancún .
they have been taking measure even since the failure in copenhagen .
accordingly , the call for energy efficiency is also welcome .
i also welcome the commission 's work 'towards a single energy network ' .
i also want to ask a question to the commission .
will we be able to achieve this , commissioner ?
there is then also the question of an interest-rate rebate on loan .
you do not save the money in the first year .
in essence , this represents an intergenerational contract in reverse .
we need to lay down new priority in relation to budgetary issue .
i have a second issue to raise a well .
i have to disagree , however : it is not clear .
the body that supply europe with study in this regard is prime .
italy 's energy consumption for 2007 wa 173 million tonne .
that then leaf italy roughly where it wa before .
the projection go up and the 20 % is subtracted .
or let u take the example of a really small country - luxembourg .
luxembourg 's energy consumption for 2007 wa 4.6 million tonne .
many of you have risen to advocate binding target .
whether binding or voluntary , national action plan are required .
we would send back any such plan on a policy basis .
the report is an excellent first step towards this .
it is something that we need to do something about .
we have enacted legislation on a great many thing .
could this money not be put to better use in europe ?
i would like to thank the commission and the relevant service .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 15 december 2010 ) .
we have a target of cutting energy consumption by 20 % .
this is why i insist on the need for an energy efficiency directive .
innovation is one of the key to success in this respect .
therefore , priority must be given to business which use cleaner technology .
however , financing still remains the most important issue .
of course , all these goal will initially require appropriate resource and investment .
in this , we need the assistance of the commission .
we must do everything in order to minimise our disadvantage .
the energy efficiency action plan therefore ha far-reaching implication .
in other word , our word must be followed up by tangible action .
yet the council ha been blocking this package for some time .
allow me just to conclude with a brief word about the correlation table .
in future , member state may wish to enact national rule .
we will continue to work towards that , at all event .
we should not push for harmonisation in all area at any price .
we must stop squeezing them with tax , red tape and absurd request .
personally , i would be surprised if member state gave preference to harmonisation .
sometimes , i think we underestimate the ability of people to adapt .
once again , i will be listening closely to business .
we therefore need to look very closely into this .
we , a parliament , are ready to play a part .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 15 december 2010 ) .
commissioner , i really hope that this will actually happen .
that is not always the case , which is highly regrettable .
we therefore need to ensure that these safety standard are improved .
many people wrongly believe that the ce mark is an indicator of safety .
it is not , however , a the commission itself say .
the latest rapex report also underline problem concerning market surveillance for toy .
and that , of course , includes the need for consistent testing method .
these study have been on the table since the middle of this year .
the method of testing , too , are not reliable enough .
i call on the commission to take action in this area , too .
i hope that we will have these value soon .
these analysis were carried out in accordance with the en 71-3 standard .
only three out of 40 laboratory misinterpreted the result of the analysis .
child below that age are more vulnerable and require greater protection .
this method would be disproportionate and would contradict the objective of better regulation .
the obligation relating to chemical substance will apply from july 2013 .
a further meeting is planned in april 2011 to conclude the work .
all toy that are on the market have to comply with current legislation .
i would like to ask two more specific question .
please reply on the ce mark , which is the safety guarantee .
a in the question tonight , people have acknowledged the job of rapex .
what is the most important is compliance with legislation .
the evidence is there that cancer is rising amongst young child in particular .
i believe i have answered most of the question put to me .
there are significant concern regarding harmful chemical found in certain toy .
the commission must be vigilant and strengthen the market surveillance of import .
however , we really need a permanent mechanism in the medium term .
the general affair council welcomed the opinion of the commission on montenegro .
we faced two particular issue with greece and ireland .
real european economic governance is a necessary precondition for this .
at the same time , public finance must be consolidated .
let u build on that by accelerating growth-enhancing reform .
that is the objective of the european stability mechanism .
the purpose of the treaty change is very specific .
it is a straightforward , pragmatic amendment to meet a specific need .
it need no more than a simple change to implement it .
i know that these principle are close to the heart of this parliament .
we are talking about something which is very important .
overcoming the crisis and creating job is the priority for our citizen .
i think we can talk directly to our friend .
i believe that we are confronted by a double salami-slicing approach .
we need an inventory of the actual national debt and bank debt .
however , there is also the salami-slicing approach on the other side .
we are currently preparing for a meeting of the european council .
one is in favour of eurobonds and another is opposed .
we need a policy which stabilises the market and the euro .
today the euro is trading at 1.34 against the u dollar .
the one ha nothing to do with the other .
both are necessary , a is the case throughout the world .
mr chastel , you spoke of the next summit .
it is no use just saying that we took the right decision .
we are taking one step forward and two step backwards .
i am not saying that it is your fault .
these discussion between mr merkel and mr untel no longer interest u .
is he going to play the lottery or what ?
by the time she take it we will have missed the train .
surely not another lost decade focusing on the wrong kind of reform ?
the failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation .
and politically , of course , you have to change the treaty .
you have not had a government in your own country since june .
here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation .
belgium is a microcosm of the entire european union .
belgium is about to fall to bit and the rest will follow .
parliament wa not consulted , despite my earlier question .
parliament need to know that it will be adequate .
a little more fiddling around with article 136 is not an answer .
thirdly , what are the technical option and condition ?
this seems especially relevant for those building debt in euro .
this issue is inextricably linked to the economic governance package .
we have this crisis because both were undermined in the past .
the issue will be discussed of course in the european council this week .
whatever change is suggested , parliament will be formally consulted on it .
any support from the esm will be based on strict conditionality .
let me also comment on the discussion on the eurobonds .
this wa rejected by the ecofin council on 9 and 10 may .
because many member state considered that this proposal resembled too closely the eurobond .
speculation can not be the cause of the problem .
we are now saying that the commission did not act .
all of these thing are now on the table .
that includes portugal , spain , the uk , hungary and latvia .
in greece they have been doing the same stupid thing for four year .
( de ) mr langen , you can sit down again now .
you have spoken very eloquently and you have said your piece .
ireland is not a southern european country , a far a i know .
can you explain to u where the irish debt come from ?
( de ) mr president , i am happy to answer that question .
mr schulz , you know that a well a i do .
( ro ) mr president , to err is human .
do you remember which political family that prime minister belonged to ?
( de ) mr president , after four year of the karamanlis government ...
no , the structural problem in greece go back further than that .
in 2000 , this parliament debated whether greece should join the euro area .
the social-democrats , the german government , had been calling for this .
that is a fact and it ha nothing to do with nationalism .
spain did not have to finance a reunification process .
however , the zapatero government in spain ha other problem .
second , we must rebalance the proposed legislation on economic governance .
the crisis ha wiped out year of budgetary effort .
when parliament were offered more power , they generally took them .
well , a it happens , there 's parliament .
under the treaty of lisbon , we are colegislators .
we are going to talk about it within the context of democracy .
you can watch the train go by or you can work .
we are doing good business on the back of this .
mr langen , you talked about reunification and you are right .
country are not liable for each other 's debt .
this is also contained in article 125 of the treaty .
when there were problem in the soviet union they called for more socialism .
a common economic policy for europe will not work .
i would just like to say a few word about eurobonds .
it is an ominous reminder of the late 1920s .
they are interested in solution and in whether their money is still safe .
we can expect the same thing to happen in my home country .
in addition , we have a huge problem in the united kingdom .
lady and gentleman , you must wake up to what is happening .
i do not understand why we are not taking the following route .
we are saying that these problem can be solved .
what do we need to enable europe to act ?
how can we create more taxation potential for a sensible , long-term economy ?
why doe the commission not make a proposal of this kind ?
i am waiting for the commission to make this proposal .
you must stop trying to talk your way out of it .
the eu is in the process of doing just the same thing .
it is undermining the competitive ability of the various country .
the crisis committee wa completely unaware and europe is a mere spectator .
today 's debate hinge on the best way to finance this instrument .
( de ) madam president , mr schulz is right .
in fact , the situation is not under control .
the member state are reacting rather than actually taking action .
they are desperately firefighting , but they can not put out the flame .
we must finish establishing the internal market , including the service sector .
then we will have laid the foundation for them .
madam president , let u start with the good news .
firstly , what should be the nature of private sector involvement ?
today , solidarity is manifesting itself in the depth of the crisis .
that is fine , but it is not enough .
the ten year of the lisbon strategy were a lost decade .
how could we have got into such a situation ?
the tax on financial transaction and eurobonds should therefore be the cornerstone .
that is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth .
the first approach is to introduce eurobonds , a we have heard .
do not try to make it more important than it really is .
we can have eurobonds for other reason . maybe .
that is a way of taking responsibility for deliberate policy .
you argued that the union and the member state should increase their spending .
the country is italy and it prime minister is mr berlusconi .
the christian democrat have been in power in italy almost uninterruptedly since 1946 .
that is the message to mr schulz and others .
we will then finalise that part of the speaking time .
i think it should be put on the record .
madam president , what matter are policy and not who applied them .
this will be achieved a a result of collective wisdom .
in the past , an american marshall plan saved the economy of europe .
the challenge today is an equivalent from european for european .
this follows 14 % pay cut in the public and private sector .
the underlying economic trend in ireland are quite good .
this will also be the time to solve the long-standing paradox of europe .
now is the time to start the single digital market .
we need to set up a permanent crisis management mechanism , preferably group-based .
thirdly , the purpose of crisis-management fund should be clearly defined .
they should not be used to solve other current problem .
i would say that mr barroso 's proposal were very interesting .
it is imperative that we do not mask reality .
there is public spending , which we must cover or reduce .
there are public and private debt , which we must repay .
there are numerous expert who have idea on everything .
but in a difficult situation , let u use common sense .
you said this is an important debate , and it is .
madam president , ireland ha been mentioned many time in this debate .
the irish government is claiming that you demanded that cut , mr rehn .
i wonder if we have any subsequent solution and subsequent step prepared ?
madam president , most ordinary people see crisis a tragedy .
eurocrats see them a opportunity to extend their tentacle of power .
for conservative , promise are tactic , not obligation .
( pl ) madam president , the end of the year is approaching .
the european union is a democratic institution which comprises many member state .
firstly , the euro area is not enough in itself .
this is not an emergency mechanism , it is a permanent one .
we need measure to halt speculation on sovereign debt .
therefore europe 's policy response must be comprehensive , consistent and determined .
in the commission 's view we have five avenue of action .
every member state should stick to it fiscal target .
the best defence against contagion is the ring-fencing of our budgetary position .
someone with no sense of humour might even think it wa insulting .
the people certainly know that the eu is not the soviet union .
mr swoboda , i fully support what you have said .
- that only touched on a point of order .
mr rehn , you do not have to respond to this .
the next speaker is mr chastel on behalf of the council .
the vote will take place on thursday , 16 december 2010 .
at the same time , member state should keep their national tax policy .
a purely intergovernmental solution can not be the right answer .
however , the current fragility of the emu requires courageous and innovative solution .
nonetheless , at the present time there are many obstacle .
this is about the regulation for long-term management plan .
these regulation lie at the heart of the common fishery policy .
the council currently ha two management plan which can not be adopted .
errant country were the exception and not the rule .
these goal are not achieved by sanction and imposed austerity measure .
this is what the citizen of the eu expect from u .
i would like to welcome the citizen here a well .
they would have significantly le difficulty in collecting one million signature .
madam president , today the european union is opening up to participatory democracy .
who should be contacted for information if one want to launch an initiative ?
a single request to register the initiative and check it admissibility .
those who are invited to sign must know what lie behind the initiative .
so it is up to the citizen to assume their responsibility .
this is a point on which parliament ha been very insistent .
in short , here we have a simple , innovative , democratic procedure .
it is now the citizen ' turn to take the floor .
we have held tough negotiation and we have achieved many substantial improvement .
they will give citizen the opportunity to explain their concern .
in any case , the negotiation have now been completed .
we have reached an agreement with the council and the commission .
this mean that there will be no opportunity to change the result .
let u return to the legislative issue we are debating today .
we all know that the european union need this very much .
i must say it wa a very nice gang .
it wa a pleasure working with all of you .
i am particularly pleased about the very clear vote in afco .
we will treat it with respect and great care .
today , we are taking a constructive step in this direction .
there were intense debate , and a multitude of good proposal were tabled .
it is certain that europe will benefit considerably from this instrument .
we also extended the time frame to 24 month .
i therefore believe that we have completed the circle , madam president .
however , among those doubt , we do have a few certainty .
we also need a european dimension for this style of democracy .
this will give u a stronger , more participatory and more legitimate democracy .
this ha been a splendidly straightforward process of cooperation .
the citizen ' initiative is a welcome addition to active citizenship .
i hope that it will be important for provoking political debate .
the partner here , however , is none other than our citizen .
this fear is unfounded , a we will indeed see .
europe is eagerly awaiting the creative idea of it citizen .
they rightly expect to be more involved in policymaking .
i would also like to take this opportunity to thank them .
i am calling on the citizen of europe to take the initiative .
lady and gentleman , there are some unprecedented moment in the european parliament .
the european parliament ha contributed a great deal to this text .
indeed , this instrument is designed to promote in-depth debate throughout civil society .
participation will only be open to those with eu citizenship .
the commission ha carte blanche not to consider proposal .
or can the commissioner rid me of these concern ?
i would like to hear your thought on that .
i support the final compromise and congratulate mr lamassoure .
it make it user-friendly , simple and accessible for citizen .
i welcome especially the transparency a regard both political and financial support .
let u be honest , there is a disconnect between policymakers and citizen .
this is what the citizen ' initiative will remedy .
moreover , this issue give rise to huge curiosity and undoubted interest .
it is very important for citizen ' voice to be heard .
madam president , the citizen ' initiative ha many guise .
it ha been described wrongly a an example of direct democracy .
however , there will be no popular vote involving all citizen .
it will not even truly be a citizen ' initiative .
only powerful interest will find it easy to mobilise opinion .
i call on the commission to take this initiative .
who will develop these thing and when can we expect a legislative proposal ?
this is what we have to follow up in this process a well .
a the debate ha shown , this is a fascinating subject .
some question remain unanswered , not all fear have been dispelled .
let u bring the citizen ' initiative to life .
i wish the citizen ' initiative all the best .
we should not be afraid of this new facet of democracy .
this is one of the long-term goal , is it not ?
citizen must find the new instrument easy to use , accessible and credible .
the citizen ' initiative is finally to see the light of day .
this incredible democratic innovation will lay the foundation for a new european citizenship .
the european parliament is encouraging rapid , effective implementation .
the citizen ' initiative is a major innovation of the treaty of lisbon .
i especially welcome the proposal for joint hearing with the commission and parliament .
therefore , i would like to make the following statement .
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
dear mr jerzy buzek , president of the european parliament ,
dear vice-presidents and honourable member of this multi-national democratic forum ,
librarian and independent journalist , three time imprisoned on political ground
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : noord holland ict/netherlands (
for the first time in the history of the european union .
we have confirmed , today , that this procedure work well .
the current stalemate of the union for the mediterranean .
( de ) i know that there is a contradiction here .
the current stalemate of the union for the mediterranean .
future of the africa/eu strategic partnership on the eve of 3rd africa/eu summit (
it should say in the text : extractive industry transparency initiative .
why did the european parliament not voice it concern ?
we should be cutting our expenditure , not increasing it .
today i am wondering whether it is the 1770s .
let me quote an observation that thomas jefferson made about remote government .
even football referee have to undergo a monitoring or an approval process .
parliament is satisfied with the goal we have achieved .
i wait to see with interest how the commission reacts to those proposal .
that is the problem with this , because it ha no binding mandate .
this is essential to europe 's transformation into a smart and sustainable economy .
i wish the commission well in the year ahead .
the democratic republic of the congo exaggerates and concentrate the tragedy of africa .
you can , i am sure , guess why i am mentioning this .
the president of the european council said that patriotism lead to war .
not everywhere can people speak freely or make known their opinion .
on 9 december , the european parliament celebrated international anti-corruption day .
m ronzulli , sit down and stop talking please .
this is not appropriate in the chamber of the european parliament .
the example he gave wa the word 'free ' .
i voted in favour of the report on advertising .
i especially appeal for child to be freed from advertising .
stop using batman , spiderman and bamse against our child .
i voted for this report because it is extremely important .
yet the measure being undertaken in the member state are far from enough .
that is why we need the binding target on energy efficiency .
energy efficiency is one of the most appropriate route .
improved energy efficiency is a very crucial major project in this endeavour .
this action plan is a good step in that direction .
that is a remarkable thing to do , but go ahead .
my job is not to monitor what member decide to say .
it is very important that we should make them more energy efficient .
the same applies to so many mode of transport .
the manufacturer should be compelled to make them more energy efficient .
i reiterate my full support to the cause of the palestinian people .
it is for this reason that i have voted against this report .
i would like to draw particular attention to the lifelong learning programme .
the flexibility instrument is provided for by the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline .
only stringency and quality teaching can make europe more competitive .
an additional asset of the budget is it greater flexibility in unforeseen circumstance .
the european union must grant itself a budget equal to it ambition .
in 2011 europe will keep it priority on target .
our concern were not about figure but rather about political demand .
we have not forgotten our seven demand adopted during the previous part-session .
only through an ambitious budget will economic recovery be possible in europe .
bitterness : codecision in budgetary matter is a losing battle .
it is important that we have reached a political agreement .
today i voted in favour of the 2011 budget .
furthermore , parliament wanted to maintain some reserve in the 2011 budget .
i will not facilitate this despicable exercise with my vote .
therefore , i have opposed the budget for 2011 .
in it negotiation with the council , parliament ha shown it teeth .
however , there are part of this budget i can not agree with .
it is for this reason i chose to abstain on budget 2011 .
however , this budget package leaf those subsidy virtually untouched .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the european globalisation adjustment fund wa created to respond to situation like these .
the member state are obliged to take appropriate measure to support these people .
i believe that eu regulation in this field should be universal .
i have therefore voted for the proposed regulation implementing this enhanced cooperation .
this problem is the subject of another eu regulation - brussels iia .
the czech republic is represented in the european parliament .
it also significantly increase their legal certainty right from the outset .
in writing . - divorce is a serious matter .
quite often it involves broken dish and divided property .
i sincerely admire the idealism of the rapporteur , tadeusz zwiefka .
the idea is good , but it need to be polished .
everything becomes particularly problematic when the husband and wife come from different country .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting .
i abstained in the vote on the report on credit rating agency .
that is the reason why i voted in favour of the report .
a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agency is necessary .
they are ready to show the convenient result to those who pay .
the future will show to what extent these will actually be applied .
i voted in favour of parliament 's resolution a i agree that :
the gradual process of regulating the financial market is beginning to take shape .
protection for investor ha been improved and transparency ha been increased .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the report .
directive 2004/22 wa an important step in this movement .
the directive in question are obsolete and do not contribute to better regulation .
a simple and up-to-date community acquis is one of the eu 's objective .
this is the right approach to achieving a simpler and leaner europe .
this ha now been done and i supported the proposal in the vote .
therefore , i have voted in favour of the report .
the validity of declaration of support will be gauged by the member state .
i abstained on the regulation to implement the european citizen ' initiative .
after all , this is what true democracy mean .
this is a clear sign that citizen together can bring down wall .
for these reason among others , we have abstained in the final vote .
third-party national who live in the eu can not take part .
i wish to emphasise a few point which must not be overlooked :
these requirement guarantee the reliability and hence the efficacy of the initiative .
i would like to ask the rapporteur if they ever collected signature themselves .
that mean 20-30 million euro to introduce a new law .
only large enterprise are able to do that , not ordinary people .
a point to remember : meps also represent these people .
the provision referred to are therefore contrary to the treaty of lisbon .
this report fully meet my expectation , particularly on three issue .
this is a potential leap forward for the european union 's democratic legitimacy .
today we voted in plenary on the european citizen ' initiative .
the eci is a new instrument of participatory democracy on a continental scale .
the trialogue of 30 november reached an agreement over various amendment .
this will create an inequality in the law within the eu .
forty-two per cent of european citizen have confidence in eu institution .
for all these reason , we are compelled to vote against .
those two initiative are extremely important to the farmer and fisherman of ireland .
the plan for the eu 's trade policy are of great importance .
this is alarming and suggests a possible change in policy .
finally someone paid attention to the difference between the european commission and god .
it is time to replace idle talking by real work .
this aspect is one of the fundamental challenge facing the eu in 2011 .
the commission 's programme make no reference to the gender issue .
i endorsed the adoption of the resolution on the commission work programme 2011 .
it is also essential to renew work on the non-discrimination directive .
in 2005 , the eu launched it strategy for africa .
the aim is the domination of market and natural resource .
this is no longer a relationship between donor and recipient .
the best way to ensure it is to finance the public education programme .
another problem which need to be resolved is corruption .
this could be used constructively for the direct benefit of the citizen .
we must apply the principle of helping people to help themselves .
mineral which are imported into the eu must be traceable .
agriculture , too , is an engine for development .
the debate around agricultural land and land ownership should be conducted thoroughly .
however , this new system is only just beginning .
therefore we have had to abstain in the vote today on this report .
in addition , the neutrality of the ecthr judge is not guaranteed .
for me the ecthr is neither european nor a court of human right .
all european must be able to benefit from the same right .
in the europe of the 21st century there is no place for discrimination .
in this respect , the role of advertising is ambivalent .
the commission must address these attack on consumer privacy .
these check should be much more frequent and their scope of application extended .
advertising also make an important contribution to providing consumer with information .
advertising is an essential tool which ensures that the free market function properly .
therefore , i agree with the proposal put forward by the rapporteur .
we are getting ever closer to a serious phenomenon of personal debt .
we must do everything we can to stop the problem from getting worse .
it encourages competition , increase competitiveness , and stimulates innovation and creativity .
advertising control is vital if we are to keep it sound and truthful .
lastly , online advertising is often aggressive and intrusive .
it need to be looked into in greater depth .
in writing . - i voted in favour for a number of reason :
1. it is time to recognise all mass medium in the internet ;
2. false information and defamation should be matter of criminal liability ;
3. in order to restrict access to vulnerable group like child ;
5. in order to induce very strict rule regarding announcement ;
the purpose of advertising is to influence consumer and purchasing behaviour .
however , the use of unfair business practice must be prevented .
however , above all it is an important economic sector .
i should like to congratulate mr juvin on his excellent work .
the report also mention other important factor that need attention .
many people even feel that they are being watched .
in theory , every user can disable this option .
these two dimension must be reconciled with one another .
it is impossible to combat climate change without considering energy efficiency .
the energy question ha now taken on a different aspect .
the use of fossil fuel is becoming increasingly a thing of the past .
the advantage are huge in term of both economic growth and job creation .
this would facilitate a reduction in the eu 's overall energy dependence .
energy efficiency mean doing 'more ' with 'fewer ' resource .
there is also a link between energy efficiency and energy poverty .
we must always consider european solidarity when legislating for energy efficiency .
the advantage are huge in term of both economic growth and job creation .
the job created will be in both rural and urban area .
in trying to do something good , we have done just the opposite .
i voted in favour of more effective protection for vulnerable consumer .
these consumer must benefit most from the energy efficiency improvement made .
however , more financial resource are needed to make the required investment .
we must therefore strengthen european union strategy in this direction .
considerable financial and human effort is required in order to achieve these objective .
in writing . - here are 10 principal guideline for energy efficiency .
collection and storage of good used for energy production ; 6 .
the energy exploitation of country - supplier ; 7 .
anti-monopoly programme for energy consumption and energy supply ; 9 .
nanotechnology in the energy supply sector and it development ; 10 .
unfortunately , these aspect are not covered by the present report .
a large proportion of the expenditure of european household is on energy bill .
adoption of binding target for 2020 is difficult for many member state .
ecr meps do not , however , support binding energy efficiency target .
in writing . - ( de ) i have voted against this report .
in writing . - ( de ) i oppose this report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
economic governance and article 9 of the treaty of lisbon ( debate )
we are not , a some say , in a 'post-crisis ' scenario .
at most we might be in a 'post-recession ' scenario .
the number of people unemployed in the european union is currently 23 million .
it is not , therefore , just a question of austerity .
we need policy that also promote growth , in other word responsible policy .
one of those wa the social clause , article 9 .
can i ask you to confirm or deny this situation ?
economic governance requires harsh , immediate action and stringent rule that are binding .
public expenditure must be reduced quickly otherwise we will be heading for catastrophe .
this is the obligation on the commission and it must implement the treaty .
it is obliged to do so under the treaty of lisbon .
when are we going to have an opportunity to discus it here ?
these are question which the commission must respond to .
we do not want any more flannel . no more plámás .
we have 3 million unemployed in the european union .
commissioner , tell me please , what are we to do about it ?
in my opinion , completely the opposite is the case .
we have too much centralism and too much conformity .
that is critical to the future welfare of european citizen .
we recognise that and therefore we need impact assessment and discussion .
such a discussion ha been conducted here in parliament .
again , our basic philosophy is that prevention is what is valuable .
prevention mean that we should influence the policy mix at the national level .
these are actual name , country , human destiny and lost life .
i will count on parliament 's continued support in this endeavour .
second , we need to tailor our approach to individual situation .
thank you also to mr ashton for her measured speech .
madam president , this report is really huge , a massive undertaking .
it is therefore a feat on which we must congratulate mr andrikienė .
however , the value of the report lie in it brevity .
i would also like to warmly congratulate mr andrikienfor her work .
for this reason , we need to have the proper structure in place .
could we please be told what that might mean in practice ?
at the same time , the world is remaining silent .
we , too - the european union- are still doing too little .
madam president , our sitting seems to be particularly devoted to human right .
i shall not go back over the sakharov prize .
i hope that this debate will enable u to make progress .
these criminal act concern believer of all religion , particularly christian .
what about the forced deportation of rom from france this year ?
but maybe word are all we can expected from the external action service .
this is probably the most important political message of the report .
unfortunately , the answer to that question is not in the affirmative .
we must stick to the fact to remain credible a an institution .
my specific concern in this regard is 'religious freedom ' .
action point for europe : lift the house arrest on dr fan .
in those country , the extremist are leaving no stone unturned .
human right must be reflected in every area of eu foreign policy .
madam president , thank you to the rapporteur for producing an excellent report .
yet the universality of that respect is failing across the world .
parliament make recommendation and , i am afraid , the council back away .
we look to you , baroness ashton , to bring those forward .
the public are now bamboozled by this human right fest .
most importantly , they are well understood throughout the world .
( pl ) madam president , i am pleased by two thing .
we can not agree to christian being treated a second-class citizen .
i must say they really do some great work .
do you not think that this is speaking with more than one voice ?
out of curiosity , why do you always sit next to the council ?
what is the philosophy or constitutional theory behind this choice ?
he ha now been imprisoned for 3 370 day .
i believe , i trust in you , lady ashton .
the question is how we will use this instrument .
we should bear in mind the international commitment of the russian federation .
i am going to respond on three particular area .
i am not suggesting that is what the eu ha done before .
but i do not want it to sit in a corner .
we will pick that point up in that conversation .
the second point wa about the breadth of the issue .
these were country which responded directly to u and which have ratified .
parliament is now a serious player in the area of human right .
all actor operating in this field will have to take note of that .
the lack of respect for the right of defenceless child is particularly repugnant .
we should follow suit and send russia a clear and resolute message .
this report doe not try to simplify all these matter .
the report approach the subject from a european standpoint .
without that , there will not be a solution .
it set a good example for many other donor too .
but there is always room for improving international coordination .
we need to do more and we need to do it better .
aligning our effort and our approach is a key aspect of the plan .
on the civilian side , we had the successful kabul conference .
it wa not the usual roll-call of request and donor pledge .
we need to encourage them to take such a long-term view .
madam president , afghanistan ha no longer a great deal of choice .
secondly , would a return to the pre-2000 situation be an option ?
thirdly , should power be entrusted to the moderate taliban ?
i urge colleague to vote against the third part of paragraph 71 .
too many young soldier from europe have lost their life in afghanistan .
we need to make greater effort in the area of civil reconstruction .
we approve it key message : there will be no military solution .
i have sent you a copy of my report , baroness ashton .
the number of people living in poverty ha increased dramatically .
i , too , would prefer to get specific answer .
the partnership with afghanistan should instead be strengthened in every way .
there are a few element that are worth considering in more detail .
i am not under-estimating the complexity of the situation .
that is making the afghan disillusioned and that ha to change .
the drug problem can not be suppressed with crop .
the resulting text is much more persuasive than the initial proposal .
( fr ) madam president , i wish briefly to say three thing .
thirdly , there is the question of political dialogue .
he is talking about the situation of woman and child in that country .
madam president , mr arlacchi 's report is well researched and informative .
i believe that it is a report which merely provides a starting point .
this is what acting both responsibly and democratically is all about .
first of all , i would like to thank the european parliament .
that ha been very well demonstrated by the discussion today .
i will conclude by again thanking mr arlacchi for the report .
i just want to make a couple of observation .
the final text say 'coalition of international force in place ' in afghanistan .
this part of the report ha been changed by the amendment .
i thank you , and i also thank baroness ashton .
today i did not even have the opportunity to speak .
thank you very much , and i wish you fruitful work .
the recent event linked to this involvement are a cause for disquiet .
the strategy pursued so far on afghanistan ha not brought the expected result .
we must support the fundamental message of this report .
i call for the withdrawal of foreign troop from afghanistan .
outcome of the nato summit in lisbon ( debate )
i wa very pleased to have participated in some of it discussion .
nato is a key strategic partner for the european union .
my ambition is to pave the way to even more progress .
i received a mandate for that at the european council on 16 september .
more than ever we have to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication .
similar exercise are planned for the next four year .
a an immediate result , 63 trained crew were deployed in afghanistan .
i believe that we need to develop this accordingly .
the third example is peacebuilding and civil conflict resolution .
the european union ha achieved a great deal in this area .
then along come nato and also want to be involved .
the next thing that nato express an interest in will be development policy .
unfortunately , it ha a split personality in security policy term .
i also support nato enlargement to georgia and ukraine one day .
thirdly , it ha consolidated the militarisation of access to energy source .
it is a false economy too , because defence spending brings good job .
today the british harrier jet is removed from service .
this would lay the nato state open to blackmail from teheran or pyongyang .
in my opinion , the nato summit wa far from being a breakthrough .
finally , what are your thought on the subject of the anti-missile shield ?
it seems that there are opposing view on this among the member state .
i would like to point out that equal partner must take equal responsibility .
there are some significant difference between nato and russia when defining security .
madam president , i would like to welcome baroness ashton here .
i think you have an opportunity to start anew .
the provision of the new strategy must now be put into effect .
the eu defence minister have touched on a sore point .
the eu doe not have adequate capacity or capability .
the term 'sharing ' and 'pooling ' describe what is now needed .
i also have something to say about election observer .
in this area we are inconsistent and sometimes even cowardly .
you now have the opportunity to say something on this subject .
we do not , therefore , agree with this philosophy .
it is insufficient , although it go in the right direction .
at the same time , there is increasing complementarity between the two .
there is a certain expertise and there are capability on the union side .
hence both are coming closer , hence complementarity is growing .
the alliance ha decided to retain nuclear weapon a the ultimate deterrent power .
the same money could have been used to build thirty thousand hospital .
i am talking about hospital costing usd ten million each .
twenty thousand three hundred and fifty-five euro each for twenty-seven million family .
you rightly noted the success and progress of capability development .
let u stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication .
it is good that it is being discussed here .
europe must set itself some homework and make sure that it is completed .
our goal must be to become an important security partner in the world .
they concern in particular the unresolved conflict in transnistria and georgia .
however , this is the general and optimistic view .
it really wa an important turning point and an important moment .
nato ha remained rather hesitant in opening up to georgia or macedonia .
however , nato 's credibility and potential still relies on u military might .
i would also like to comment on the conclusion of the nato-russia council .
it may be taken a a declaration of goodwill .
georgia wa invaded by russia and two of it autonomous territory practically annexed .
i think that we need to take this into account .
this discussion , today , is about cooperation between nato and the union .
actually the area that we are working in are indeed very complementary .
finally , structured cooperation : will it happen , what is being done ?
it is indeed for member state to come forward with idea .
i hope and expect to see more of that in the future .
doe this statement still hold true now , after the lisbon summit ?
however , it inevitably raise serious moral and strategic question a well .
the historic direction of peace-making and agreement must at any rate be welcomed .
all candidate had agreed beforehand the ground rule of the election .
it concluded that the election were held in democratic condition .
the international community ha been unanimous in recognising him .
ecowas and the african union have been crystal clear in their message .
mr ouattara is the legitimate president of côte d'ivoire .
on 3 december the acp-eu parliamentary assembly wa equally unambiguous in it declaration .
african body have already resorted to sanction on côte d'ivoire .
the response of the european union to this crisis is vital .
everyone wanted all that to come to an end with these election .
we are unfortunately faced with an extremely delicate situation .
an african representative and a european representative are responsible for drafting it .
our first responsibility this evening is to call for calm and dialogue .
however , this is also the responsibility of the main ivorian leader .
they mobilised to ensure that the result of the election wa respected .
this pressure must continue and sanction must be applied .
alassane ouattara must work tirelessly for the reconciliation of his people .
the united nation is backing u in this process .
we will not allow his obstinacy to lead to chaos in côte d'ivoire .
there is only one legitimate president : president ouattara .
the political instability is already having a significant impact .
there are two quick point i want to make .
of course i have kept in touch with ban ki-moon throughout .
i am expecting the list to be ready within the next few day .
the vote will take place at 12.00 on thursday , 16 december 2010 .
i therefore fully agree with the word of baroness ashton .
in the case of implementing act , the situation is a bit different .
my first priority wa that we could keep these important position .
i understand that it wa very difficult to get an agreement in council .
this will represent a real revolution in the field of commercial policy .
this is not a resident ' association , this is parliament !
if the council is involved , parliament is involved .
if this mean waiting for a second-reading agreement , then so be it .
we are codecision maker , colegislators in this regard .
i am not sure that this 'compromise ' achieves that .
there are , nevertheless , two thing which we consider need your attention .
it also raise interinstitutional distrust and we are all concerned by this situation .
we can not accept the prior exclusion of delegated act .
ahead of u lie a number of difficult year , without doubt .
the previous primary legislation only provided for implementing measure .
this regulation will definitely not come to a decision on this .
the regulation only cover the procedure in the case of article 291 .
my second point concern the criticism of article 10 .
this article also relates only to the procedure and nothing else .
this ha been reinforced once again in comparison with the previous interinstitutional agreement .
the only thing which is really new is the procedure for external trade .
for me , this question is all about weighing up the benefit .
despite the convention 's demand , nothing wa done .
it ha made every effort to ensure that something wa achieved .
allow me to react to some of the comment .
so our commitment to transparency and clarity is absolutely clear .
but several aspect fall short of full compliance with the treaty of lisbon .
that is why they should take first place in the quota .
however , a small number of your amendment are politically more delicate .
it also mean that we must respect regional , cultural and linguistic diversity .
this will inevitably lead to the unfair exclusion of many important site .
i hope that we were able to contain this , going forward .
this is something that we need to be mindful of .
europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulty at present .
( de ) mr president , i am much obliged to mr scurria .
i greatly appreciate what he had to say on this matter .
we shall also talk about it with the council .
i obviously heard mr martin just now saying that we should avoid bureaucracy .
mr takkula ha asked permission to ask a question .
mr takkula , you may put a question to mr badia .
i believe that what we are doing is unnecessary .
this is almost certainly the first christian church in europe .
which brings me to the last point in my comment .
they are core value that we want to take forward .
in my view , it is an excellent and necessary one .
it can raise our awareness of our common cultural heritage .
i have seen that in relation to the european city of sport .
there are a few good thing about this which should be commended .
i think we can be very proud of this .
i am talking about eastern europe and occupation by the soviet union .
today , we are adopting a symbol , namely the european heritage label .
anyone who travel know the value and importance of such scheme .
they are capable of generating cohesion and solidarity on a large scale .
one of the upshot of this will be to boost cultural tourism .
i wish to end by stressing the importance of promoting intercultural dialogue .
i am very pleased and very grateful for this approval .
common but diverse cultural heritage is what will unite u .
there is no doubt that the institution will operate with absolute clarity .
i welcome this initiative and the report that ha been presented .
i would like to congratulate mr paliadeli on her work on this report .
like everyone else , i wa very pleased with this development .
that is why we have made some good progress today .
lady and gentleman , what is it that we need to do today ?
we can either say 'yes ' or 'no ' .
what are the key point of this agreement with switzerland ?
the agreement will remain in place until one of the party pull out .
it ha expressed an interest in such an arrangement for a long time .
the commission welcome the participation of switzerland in the two programme .
it ha also , however , increased the capital of nation .
i believe that that will generate added value in all respect .
mr president , finally , i wish to thank our rapporteur .
finally , switzerland is tuning it pulse of life to the european union .
the benefit of being in the european union without the obligation .
here today , i am a bit dubious a well .
likewise , the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminal .
the important prevailing aim is that youth organisation should take part .
the people do not need to be consulted on every single issue .
i welcome the initiative to include switzerland in cooperation in this area .
a of today , only 18 member state have submitted complete data .
therefore , the above picture is far from being complete .
commissioner , this is merely a matter of simple arithmetic .
i know what i want this parliament and the commission to say .
after all , producer have had ten year to comply .
mr president , commissioner , your answer have failed to convince me .
however , we have no idea how to deal with them .
the public is very sensitive to animal welfare issue .
it is not unreasonable to expect something in return from all member state .
we have already made a demand at committee level .
we actually need to place a catalogue of measure on the table immediately .
we can not accept the possibility of further discussion aimed at extending deadline .
this point must be regulated immediately at the very least .
the european union is in pole position when it come to animal welfare .
we can use it to back up our argument worldwide .
what is going to be the outcome of that ?
i really think we need to know where we are going .
there is neither the cash nor the logistics to prevent this .
how do you remove and dispose of 100 million hen in 24 hour ?
do any of these country have a reputation for high welfare standard ?
it will completely undermine the effort of colony egg producer in the uk .
i believe that an intra-community trading ban is a complete non-starter .
unstamped egg are a gift to a fraudulent trader .
we have learnt this the hard way in the uk .
this involves massive capital cost and to comply mean borrowing money .
the regulation ha put about 15 penny on a dozen egg .
egg from illegal cage will undercut those who obeyed the eu .
one producer borrowed gbp 10 million to comply with this directive .
is the commission going to renege and make his egg uncompetitive ?
the recent crisis show where this can lead u .
public confidence in the eu is at an all-time low .
it is not time to play chicken with the egg farmer .
i would particularly question the figure , and perhaps you might clarify them ?
did you say that 66 % of production is now free-range ?
morally and ethically , we can not dump those egg .
i will conclude : the legislation will be compulsory from 2012 .
i do not think we can backtrack on this .
the language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforcement .
word like 'proportionate ' and 'dissuasive ' have been used .
commissioner , i am asking you to guarantee it a well .
i am interested in the reference to the marking or stamping of egg .
are they simply going to force these company to rely on third-country import ?
we understand those farmer who have already invested money in modernising cage .
i wanted to mention two other point in my contribution .
the issue of egg in shell is quite visible and clear .
this is a very real problem for the european union .
that could cause major problem for producer and , ultimately , for consumer .
so the commission ha a huge balancing act to get this right .
i am very happy with what the commissioner ha said .
you had the opportunity to raise your concern before we closed the debate .
this orderly procedure sends out the right signal to the public .
i should like to express my particular gratitude to the house service .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:40 and resumed at 12:00 )
thank you for having overwhelmingly signed this written declaration .
control by member state of the commission 's exercise of implementing power (
human right in the world 2009 and eu policy on the matter (
we simply wish to remove the word 'in croatia ' .
i do not believe it is controversial with the other group .
madam president , there are two addition to the text .
after 'list of individual responsible for ' , insert 'severe ' .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
that is what i wanted to say , madam president .
the lifelong learning programme and the youth in action programme are good example .
madam president , i would like to put one question to the house .
it people are twice a rich a the citizen of the member state .
and we should not leave it at our relation with brussels !
between 1998 and 2007 , it had real interest rate of -1 % .
we award the sakharov prize to recipient from around the world .
it ha postponed the decision to the near future .
the power of the european parliament have recently been increased .
( fi ) madam president , i voted for mr andrikienė 's report .
this lie at the heart of the european union .
we must also ensure that we practise what we preach .
we must ourselves ensure that we are not discriminating against any one minority .
i have rarely come across a proposal a strange a this .
this is tantamount to using beelzebub to exorcise the devil .
i would just like to say one thing about this report .
the new european heritage label may be helpful in just this respect .
it will stimulate economic attractiveness , particularly through cultural tourism .
by supporting this label , we will improve multicultural dialogue .
i abstained because of the abovementioned contradiction in the report .
switzerland will conform to eu financial control and audit provision .
cooperation with switzerland on education matter is an important step in eu-switzerland relation .
we must develop and strengthen exchange , cooperation and mobility .
likewise , the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminal .
the rapporteur therefore recommends that parliament approves the draft council decision .
traditionally , the plenary session in december is partly devoted to human right .
the rapporteur 's oral amendment reflected these positive trend in russia .
i voted in favour of this report with conviction .
i am voting in favour of the report by mr andrikienė .
i should like to congratulate mr andrikienon her excellent work .
two gue amendment were adopted ( equal access to healthcare/treatment and colombia ) .
i voted for the report on a new strategy for afghanistan .
the system that ha been in place until now must be changed .
the coalition need to be stricter when controlling these fund .
on the other hand , we must stop interfering in afghan affair .
a solely military response can not be enough , it is true .
in writing . - this report highlighted many of the problem facing afghanistan .
i abstained on amendment calling for more support to the afghan state .
the report highlight very well the many problem affecting that country .
there is no military solution for afghanistan , something the report also state .
it is important that the report actually highlight this unsatisfactory state of affair .
in general , the rapporteur ha quite correctly recognised the situation in afghanistan .
europe 's first line of defence is not at the hindu kush .
it is for that reason that i have voted against this report .
on the contrary , the islamist taliban is growing in strength .
it is for that reason that i have voted against this report .
it try to find way to elevate the eu role .
the commission can therefore be considered the executive branch of the union .
the commission 's proposal is a concerted attack on democracy .
this report settle for amending it without actually condemning that fact .
i shall be voting against this latest authoritarian move .
there have always been effort to centralise control within the european union .
in theory , there is a clear acceptance of the subsidiarity principle .
however , this is frequently ignored or skirted in practice .
the aim is to ensure that the plutocracy doe not go bust .
unfailing solidarity is today the best answer that we can give the market .
our support for the general provision is not support for ccctb .
over 150 million eu citizen live outside the euro area .
i shall therefore vote against this report , which i also condemn .
i am therefore voting against this motion for a resolution .
we need to find new and innovative instrument to finance the crisis mechanism .
for many year , côte d'ivoire wa the archetype of good decolonisation .
unfortunately , a latent political crisis ha gradually undermined côte d'ivoire .
the outgoing president , mr gbagbo , refused to hand over power .
ever since , the country ha sunk into unbelievable confusion .
the situation in côte d'ivoire is to be condemned at all level .
we can not accept this unconstitutional , anti-democratic hold-up .
the political situation in the côte d'ivoire is extremely critical .
deadline must be respected to make the european union 's action credible .
it ha been 10 year since the directive entered into force .
however , many factory farm are still not up to standard .
the risk that many business will not be in compliance alarm u .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the report .
this is the case in italy , for example .
for this reason , i voted for the proposed amendment .
we thank you for your work and welcome you to the european parliament .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on malaysia .
however , this also involves the rule of law with universal standard .
mr president , this resolution condemns the practice of caning in malaysia .
malaysia is a member of the un human right council .
sadly , western concept of human right are le developed in malaysia .
it is the same when it come to relationship between state .
malaysia is a valued close partner of the european union .
that is why we view what is going on in malaysia so seriously .
the situation we are discussing today is an unfortunate illustration of this .
thousand of people are subject to caning in malaysia every year .
lady and gentleman , what we are talking about is nothing exotic .
it is everyday life in the so-called moderate islamic world .
( pl ) mr president , malaysia is an economic tiger .
mr president , inflicting physical pain is against human dignity .
account show that the pain is so great that victim often lose consciousness .
beating up people and whipping people on behalf of the government must stop .
instead of restricting this practice , the malaysian government encourages it .
moreover , prison officer receive financial reward for caning prisoner .
in malaysia , this practice ha reached epidemic proportion .
the european union ha been cooperating closely with malaysia for eight year .
it is an issue to which we pay a lot of attention .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
uganda : the bahati bill and discrimination against the lgbt population
why return , one year later , with an almost identical resolution ?
thirdly , only 13 african country recognise homosexual ' right .
in many african country , sadly , homosexuality is indeed outlawed .
in mauritania , sudan and northern nigeria , it is punishable by death .
the draft amendment to ugandan legislation really do represent a radical change .
the bill already mentioned may indeed reappear at any time .
many of them apply for asylum in european country .
however , the bahati bill would make thing even worse .
people would be required to report on each other on privacy matter .
the fact is that these country choose to work with u .
we have the acp jpa , we have the cotonou agreement .
it is not colonialism to stand up for the right of others .
mr president , this is an interesting and important debate .
certainly , sometimes it is said that 'no news , good news ' .
the vote will take place at the end of the next debate .
mr president , the situation of the eritrean refugee in sinai is tragic .
mr president , lady and gentleman , let u be honest .
let u once again be clear : 'the situation is serious ' .
we were not permitted to include that proposal in this resolution .
the situation in the horn of africa is an alarming one .
the other issue is that member state should admit the refugee voluntarily .
when will you realise that the european union is saturated with immigrant ?
in the same way , human trafficking in africa ha reached alarming proportion .
( pl ) mr president , eritrean refugee are in a tragic situation .
this case is not the only cause for concern .
migrant and refugee in egypt still suffer from many protection gap .
the most serious incident are reported in the sinai .
there have been some positive development that should be stressed .
you asked to speak on the rule of procedure .
you should speak on that and not something else .
mr president , of course it is a point of order .
the commission could at least ask for the completion of the resettlement .
unfortunately , that is not a point of order .
otherwise , this matter doe not come under the rule of procedure .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
if there are no objection , we shall proceed a suggested .
uganda : the bahati bill and discrimination against the lgbt population (
i am aware that ten percent is generally sufficient .
however , that would not have been enough in this case .
anyway , i did ask in advance and you had plenty of time .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute

i have several thing to say a we begin .
the european parliament ha already taken up mr zhisheng 's case several time .

since our last meeting , important political event have also taken place .
both of these are on the order of business of our plenary part-session .

we are having an official debate about that on wednesday at 15:00 .
we will make a decision about this very soon .
we now have a bicameral parliament in the european union .
the european parliament and the council legislate on equal term .
thank you , mr chountis , for calling attention to this .
a you said yourself , the decision ha not yet been taken .
i would like to thank both of you for raising this matter .
we will decide how this matter will be handled in future .
so there is a proposal to adopt a resolution on the matter .
i understand mr cohn-bendit want to say something about this request .
i would ask you to remove brazil from the urgency on the agenda .
statement by the president of the european parliament on the situation in tunisia
today , we pay tribute to the victim of these event .
let u observe a minute 's silence in memory of our tunisian friend .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
lady and gentleman , the 'jasmine revolution ' continues .
in many respect , this is a truly historical time .
it is they who are the source of the change .
it is , however , only the beginning of a long road .
this is why we do not remain indifferent , today .
in addition , we call for the change to be peaceful in character .
they must serve justice and the rule of law .
firstly , the release of all those who have been arbitrarily arrested .
lady and gentleman , let u support the tunisian .
a i speak , the security situation remains precarious .
repressive regime across the world continue to use technology to silence free speech .
because of fear ; because people were afraid of islamism .
second , the transitional government is not a government of national unity .
we did not know in 1989 how poland would turn out .
we did not know how russia would turn out with gorbachev .
i congratulate the army on it professionalism in protecting the republic 's institution .
however , the european authority manage to be more vocal towards other regime .
there is a long way to go before the tunisian regain confidence .
men have already immolated themselves in algeria , egypt and mauritania .
do not think that it can not happen in european country .
harmonised condition for the marketing of construction product ( debate )
for economic growth , construction is essential for job and employment .
it is also one of the most dangerous sector to work within .
i would also like to briefly comment on smes .
in the european union , we should always strive for better regulation .
this look , in particular , at the so-called comitology aspect .
besides , 14 year in this chamber were not spent in vain .
of course , it is also important to place safety at the forefront .
i believe that we still have work to do with regard to labelling .
unfortunately , the belgian presidency made an error during the negotiation .
the hungarian presidency ha now addressed this in a letter .
the compromise therefore receives our support at this second reading .
in europe today , the construction sector directly employ 12 million eu citizen .
it is not perfect , it is a compromise .
we have all been talking about a technical issue .
we all know that construction is a basic pillar of the economy .
we have managed to achieve a compromise , a good compromise for everyone .
we have managed to sort out the issue of hazardous substance .
i just want to make two concluding remark in endorsing this agreement .
i trust that parliament in it entirety will do the same tomorrow .
i am therefore pleased that my proposal wa included in the compromise .
i believe that this report is heading in the right direction .
there is something that struck me throughout this debate .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 18 january 2011 .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the content of her report .
consequence in the european union of the dioxin animal feed incident ( debate )
no delivery of feed fat were made outside of germany .
what ha the commission done to help manage the incident ?
this concern a very serious infringement of eu food safety provision .
the german authority are informed and have agreed to this visit .
madam president , commissioner , i am rather surprised by your remark .
it is also extremely important to increase the number of state inspector .
the eu regulation and national legislation need to be improved in this regard .
what action are you intending to take , then ?
the alert wa given nearly three week after these oil were delivered .
they then evade liability and farmer and consumer pay the price .
in other word , we need a risk-based form of monitoring throughout europe .
we need to ensure that this is the case .
if they are , they should be prosecuted for it .
i can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment .
let u not simply go wholesale and bring in new legislation .
since 1999 , there have been five dioxin scandal in germany alone .
competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in germany .
state check are rarely carried out on feed and food producer .
the contamination would then have been detected in time .
numerous consumer have now been contaminated with additional dioxin once again .
that is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminant .
we need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable it traceability .
we must put a stop to the work of these adulterator throughout europe .
we need to be faster in this regard in general .
the value were a maximum of four time too high .
the people of europe have been shown their reflection .
individual are increasingly resorting to criminal mean and method .
however , we will all lose out in the end a a result .
we must finally tackle the cause of this problem .
i hope that the agriculture council will comment on this .
however , there is also a need for monitoring and surveillance .
there is still a great deal of self-monitoring in the industry .
we need more monitoring of those doing the monitoring .
that is too few and we need to increase that number .
lady and gentleman , today we see how well it is doing .
lady and gentleman , what is happening about the disposal of these food ?
we talk about the disposed egg and the disposed meat and what ...
we do not have animal husbandry any more - we have meat production .
it is a model which doe not guarantee food safety .
are the current mechanism for monitoring the safety of our food really adequate ?
there seems to be any number of food scandal .
the eu 's enthusiasm for biofuels can therefore have unintended consequence .
we have the strongest consumer protection system in the world .
consumer need to bear that in mind right now .
he said that , essentially , the system work .
obviously , we know that the system ha gone wrong .
unfortunately , this important development stalled on 8 december in the health council .
we hope that the council and the commission adopt a similar attitude .
the problem lie in compliance , control and sanction system .
however , the commissioner mentioned something that is extremely important .
are we really sure that the product on our kitchen table are safe ?
i hope that europe can take inspiration from this law .
there are still thing that need to be done in this area .
above all , we need to put a stop to the self-controlled test .
a consumer , we do not want to eat contaminated food .
i would therefore like to put two question to the commission .
the existence of thousand of farmer is currently under threat .
study quite clearly show that people would be happy to pay .
on the feed hygiene regulation , they want guidance and a workshop .
i would ask that we truly learn from this scandal .
i do not believe that we should make them stricter .
i would have liked your opinion on this matter , commissioner .
thirdly , we need tougher penalty for the criminal .
this is not a minor offence - it wa done with intent .
i believe that that is the current reality of the situation .
here , i would like to comment on the rapid alert system .
we also need to strengthen our rule and regulation .
we must ensure that this incident is now kept under control .

recommendation by yannick jadot , on behalf of the committee on international trade
[ 10028/2010 - c7-0170/2010 - 2010/0062 ( nle ) ]
the group of the alliance of liberal and democrat for europe
the group of the progressive alliance of socialist and democrat in the european parliament
the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left
the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrat )
a you all know , the forest is receding .
the issue that we are raising today is therefore obviously a crucial one .
today , we are talking about the republic of the congo and cameroon .
however , regulating and enforcing these agreement will prove a challenge .
but the will is there and for that we should be very pleased .
careful management can bring down illegal and unsustainably imported timber .
they need u to support their ability to voice any concern .
they provide a mechanism for tackling the massive illegal trade in timber .
i would just like to express three this evening .
there are two more point i would like to mention .
i am in complete agreement with the point made by the previous speaker .
i know that illegal logging is just the visible tip of the iceberg .
each year , usd 10-15 billion is lost in revenue .
there is a definite cost in term of resource .
i would emphasise , too , that member state also make fiscal contribution .
we have also dedicated human resource to the implementation of flegt .
it will discourage unregulated , unsustainable exploitation of forest .
i take note of the human right situation in partner country .
however , with flegt , we are definitely not taking a wrong step .
the problem are greatest in some of the world 's poorest country .
the good is not the enemy of the best .
we must not prevent the poor country of today from taking that opportunity .
this is completely unnecessary , particularly when there are perfectly good alternative .
i would have preferred the agreement to be binding rather than voluntary .
after all , corruption is a topical issue in cameroon .
the timber industry is a very important one for the country .
after crude oil , it is the second largest source of export income .
this is why it is so important to strengthen legal trade in timber .
it is an important instrument for giving new impetus to the negotiation .
the question is : are we doing what we need to do ?
finally , a series of delegated act is needed for the timber regulation .
we have two year until the regulation applies in full .
i am therefore very pleased that this debate is taking place .
where a lot of felling take place , there must also be regeneration .
we are still negotiating but we have high hope of a positive conclusion .
so i would say that the risk here are minimal .
we should also consider the global commitment to fight climate change .
let u take , for example , energy efficiency drive .
we made a start , and other part of the world have followed .
i believe there are a lot of way in which we can lead .
thank you for your desire to work with the european parliament .
the vote will take place on wednesday ( 19 january 2011 ) .
the insight they provided allowed me to make specific input to the report .
thirdly , i will comment on the future of ec-pacific trading relation .
i would urge the fijian government to make move towards democracy .
i hope that this house will follow his advice .
that is why there is also financial assistance to enhance trade capacity .
under no circumstance can the european union shirk it commitment to sustainable development .
it would also mean unfair competition for eu product .
what we have seen so far is that this is not happening .
it is really they who are the major beneficiary of the agreement .
a the rapporteur said , it particularly affect tuna .
here , we are hearing the complaint that are being made .
we want to know whether this agreement is aiding development in this archipelago .
i am not questioning the development policy implemented by the agreement .
this phenomenon can only get worse if this derogation is maintained .
in particular , it is impossible to verify the origin of catch .
provisional application date from 2008 , and we have some experience with figure .
it will not cause any disruption to europe 's fishing or canning industry .
i shall now turn to a broader issue : the epa in general .
it is true that regional cooperation is rather difficult at the start .
it is not just trade agreement that make regional development happen .
this ha a highly disruptive effect in the country concerned .
author . - mr president , i will be brief .
why are we giving a derogation to papua new guinea ?
here , we are actually doing something positive for downstream activity .
it ha to meet all our sanitary and phytosanitary condition .
at the moment , however , the statistic speak for themselves .
there is no threat to the european tuna industry .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 january 2011 .
amongst the association that contacted me wa the amici dell'adozione .
often , these child spend their youth shuttling between social worker and orphanage .
a child should spend a little time a possible in an institution .
this is a specific step which address the question raised today .
the italian model , and that of other place , can be followed .
the problem of abandoned child is becoming more serious in europe .
this is a dream for those child who grow up in institution .
i assume that the commission will take the lead in this work .
this explains the large number of child in care home .
however , 22 966 child do have a parent .
therefore , these child are not eligible for adoption .
this also applies to the 22 285 child in foster care .
finally , i recommend that everyone becomes more familiar with national legislation .
therefore , the first step is to provide appropriate care for these child .
the second step is to combat child trafficking and prostitution .
the fourth step is that only then should international adoption be considered .
between 1997 and 2000 , commissioner , romania 'exported ' 9 150 child .
my country will never accept such an abomination again .
in practice , major legal problem still arise in connection with international adoption .
thus , the eu should not reinvent the wheel in this area .
i welcome the commissioner 's statement in this regard .
i would like to warn very strongly against this .
these child deserve the highest degree of protection by the community .
the overview of the practice is at least a important a legislation .
exactly what kind of data are we collecting about this topic ?
is there an age limit a regard the child or the adoptive parent ?
what kind of support do member state provide in problematic case ?
give help , and do not take child from their family .
first of all , this mean that they deserve a family .
this clearly facilitates the development of criminal activity by child trafficking network .
the debate tonight reflects the interest that there is in adoption .
certainly , the birth family are very important in all of this .
this ha been a really useful debate and i thank colleague for it .
most child find that in their own home with their natural parent .
many though , get this with their adoptive parent .
this is a tragic situation which our democracy can not tolerate .
hundred of child are being illegally adopted or put up for trade .
i have five point to make in summing up the debate .
the commission considers accreditation to be a matter of national authority .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 january 2011 .
there are thousand of orphaned or abandoned child who live in substandard condition .
therefore , the welfare of the child must always take priority .
that is something that the united nation also need to take into account .
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
is the commissioner aware of what is at stake today ?
let u establish a broad inter-faith dialogue under the auspex of the eu .
the movement which we are witnessing is , in fact , a groundswell .
we are clearly seeing islam becoming a state religion .
the presence of christian everywhere is a balancing factor .
these are the concern i wanted to share with you tonight .
schengen membership surely mean the free movement of people and good .
who would ever question 1956 , 1989 or the autumn of 2006 ?
they are the one who are attempting to corrode the unified european spirit .
greece therefore face a massive crisis a far a this issue is concerned .
we are still waiting for an eu-turkey agreement to be signed .
europe should know this and bear it in mind .
this afternoon , we debated the serious reversal in tunisia .
activist from the left-wing movement 'kazakhstan 2012 ' are being harassed and jailed .
i demand that the eu stop boosting the nazarbayev dictatorship .
the topic could not have been anything other than the hungarian medium law .
the commission itself cited this in a paper in 2006 .
it begs the question of why the proposal ha not been produced ?
i urge the commission to get a move on .
they are now seeking to avenge their hurt interest .
there ha been no improvement in the effectiveness of the fight against crime .
the burgeoning paranoia about the use of such eavesdropping is even more unacceptable .
the content of recorded conversation mysteriously circulate in the medium .
the bulgarian prime minister also figured in one of the recorded conversation .
the content were discrediting , but he claim it wa manipulated .
the treaty of lisbon established the european external action service .
( fr ) mr president , i congratulate mr striffler on her report .
mr president , i should briefly like to ask some question .
secondly , there is something else that we must not ignore .
it is right to provide humanitarian aid for people in need .
this includes , in particular , political or armed conflict .
i would like to give you one example of this .
it is development that can lay the foundation for lasting peace .
on 8 december , the commission adopted a communication on this .
we also concluded that there is scope for further improvement in three area .
let me just respond here to the question of accountability .
i recently cut the ribbon of our humanitarian aid office there .
unfortunately , there will be more and more natural and man-made disaster .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 18 january 2011 .
the development of transport is a factor which facilitates the delivery of aid .
this is why getting business involved is so important .
global food stock are much more restricted nowadays than in the past .
just 7 % of farmer across europe are under the age of 35 .
i regret that we are debating this report just before midnight .
we need all production system to contribute to our food security .
the single key problem with agriculture is low income for farmer .
food is becoming , to an ever greater degree , a strategic product .
we must respect agriculture - it is the guarantee of our food security .
for this , we also need strategic coordination on a global scale .
child and adult alike are starving in the centre of the european union .
in four minute , mr sârbu covered a multitude of issue .
first , there is a need for a well-funded cap .
that is the question i would like to ask .
for them , the common agricultural policy make a real difference .
the report recommends the creation of a global food system .
we have had experience in the past of commodity board .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 18 january 2011 .
food security is a political priority at both european and world level .
eu member state have not encountered food security problem .
a glance into the future show how urgent the need for action is .
by 2050 , expert estimate that global demand for food will double .
indeed , large area of farmland are not used efficiently .
this is an interesting index which must give u food for thought .
the first item on the agenda is the joint debate on the ec-serbia agreement
recommendation by jelko kacin , on behalf of the committee on foreign affair .
stabilisation and association agreement between the ec and serbia .
civilian supervision of the armed force ha also been strengthened .
this also hold true for serbia 's relation with bosnia and herzegovina .
at the moment , that is still not the case .
the agreement establishes a new framework for political dialogue .
the council started the ratification process for the agreement on 14 june 2010 .
this can be expected in the second half of 2011 .
at the same time , serbia still need to make major reform .
i welcome the fact that many result have already been achieved .
lastly , allow me to share a concluding thought with you .
the mean of doing this are in our hand .
the benefit of this agreement for the european union are equally significant .
serbia 's market ha now been opened up to european union exporter .
i hope that ratification by the other member state will follow soon .
i am therefore grateful to the rapporteur , jelko kacin .
the augury for serbia 's road towards europe are reasonably good .
a very warm welcome to you , mr đelić .
this compromise really is necessary and we must all help to achieve it .
it is also crucial that serbia stabilises it economy .
the eu is simply letting itself be trifled with .
we are talking here about the perpetrator of horrific war crime and genocide .
they should not be allowed to get away with murder .
serbia can , and must , do a lot more to arrest them .
serbia 's relationship with kosovo is problematic but not insoluble .
serbia is even more corrupt than romania and bulgaria .
i therefore call on you not to underestimate it .
none of these problem can be solved without the contribution of serbia .
mr kacin 's report make a remarkable contribution in that direction .
some of the challenge that are faced by serbia have already been mentioned .
i would like to add something on the challenge of judicial reform .
that is clearly a key issue in term of the rule of law .
( pl ) madam president , serbia is a european country .
serbia is not just a part of europe 's geography .
we must end this inequality once and for all .
commissioner , i have a second question for you .
this concern the activity of radical islamic force in sandžak .
clearly , this also applies to relation with bosnia and herzegovina .
we are not completely satisfied in this area - more can be done .
our prompting in this regard have not really been satisfied .
i would therefore ask everyone to put pressure on for this to happen .
serbia must also work on these issue for serbia itself .
however , there are still challenge ahead for both serbia and the eu .
serbia is a crucial part of that with this commitment ...
what we need is a clear and united message from the serbian government .
the future of serbia and the western balkan is in the european union .
a democratic country 's future should not be controlled by it totalitarian past .
the only thing they are interested in are their own interest .
i believe that we should decide on this next december .
for a long time , this wa a sensitive issue .
the key are in serbia 's hand and serbia must meet the condition .
i will turn now to relation with the republic of kosovo .
serbia wa , and continues to be , an influential balkan country .
the european union 's role is to support these country and help them .
serbia 's democratic government and president tadić deserve our support .
a modern , european serbia ha a major responsibility here .
serbia made the right choice by signing the stabilisation and association agreement .
it committed itself to undertaking a range of undoubtedly difficult reform .
let me address briefly some question which were raised during the debate .
reflection is ongoing regarding the support for technological development .
it ha also been said that the situation is fragile .
mr brok and mr swoboda pointed this out a well .
the rule of law is the key copenhagen criterion .
we welcome belgrade 's recent effort to understanding these challenge .
to conclude , i would like to leave you with one thought .
at what pace it will progress depends solely on serbia itself .
the vote to that effect will take place tomorrow at 12:30 .
( the sitting wa suspended at 10:25 and resumed at 10:30 )
review of the belgian presidency of the council ( debate )
colleague , allow me to welcome prime minister yves leterme .
to achieve this , during this presidency , we followed two major guideline .
first , we did not want to push ourselves forward .
however , lady and gentleman , those six month are over .
of course , we can not dwell on the past .
i would now like to mention them in brief .
these move are good but they have to be consolidated .
thirdly , we have to address the financial perspective of the union .
i will first quote in french , and then translate :
i can only say : 'look around you ' .
what is really at issue is our collective destiny .
i would therefore like to congratulate the belgian presidency most sincerely .
the commission is proud of the contribution it made to this outcome .
mr president , the belgian presidency ha rightly received praise from all quarter .
however , this can not be said of the belgian presidency .
that also partly explains the success of the belgian presidency .
the belgian presidency had a clear focus on europe , however .
more poverty and more social inequality also translate to a loss of competitiveness .
that ha been proven economically , financially and empirically .
naturally , we wish belgium all the best for the future , too .
it is not without importance how the actor on the political stage behave .
in this connection , i wish you all the best .
in many way , you represented an exemplary presidency .
i hope that other , subsequent presidency follow your example .
it wa like this in former time in my own country too .
they are afraid that their liberty of expression is in danger .
mr president , i propose that we debate the hungarian presidency tomorrow .
i would say the same about the european patent .
now , that wa a major breakthrough , mr president .
in any case , i welcome this and i congratulate you .
you would not think that the incumbent belgian government wa resigning .
i am very familiar with both belgium and europe .
there are some who therefore say that belgium is europe in miniature .
there is not even a successor to mr leterme in the pipeline .
at the moment , we in europe are busy planting a transfer economy .
now we are faced with a call for eurobonds .
mr verhofstadt call for that on a daily basis .
let this be a wake-up call for all of u .
we were in the european year for combating poverty .
it is a single economic , cultural and perhaps also political force .
it had no ambition to add it own agenda .
( nl ) mr president , i risk repetition .
i think that a period of reflection on the matter ha been initiated .
this is a specific contribution without which europe would be far worse off .
i am here , on your left , mr prime minister .
i need to have a frank conversation with you .
during your presidency , you could have done more than look at refugee .
you could have done something to help ; it wa not difficult .
then tell refugee to look at article 290 , look at delegated act .
they will say : 'what are you talking about ?
i am sorry to say this ; i say it in sadness .
i hope that future presidency will learn from this example .
obviously , your success wa not an easy one .
i hope that we can continue in this way .
there can not be unequal treatment of worker who come to europe .
for now though , i offer it my most sincere congratulation .
it wa during the belgian presidency that this one promise wa broken .
that is the legacy of the belgian presidency , and it is regrettable .
( hu ) now i should like to continue in hungarian .
the irish rescue package wa put together at record speed .
( fr ) once again , congratulation to my belgian colleague .
i hope we will have just a much success during the hungarian presidency .
the area of international relation wa also exceptionally important .
mr president , could i raise a wider issue here ?
only something on that scale will give market durable confidence .
i would ask people to discus this , because perhaps he is right .
obviously , thing can not continue in this way .
the treaty of lisbon give parliament power relating to fishery .
this good path serf to strengthen a community rather than a government approach .
an undoubted achievement of the belgian presidency is the strengthening of economic governance .
agency which supervise financial institution have begun their work .
much ha been done towards budget discipline being more rigorously observed .
activity aimed at structural reform have been made the main instrument of development .
nowadays , there must be a seamless transfer from one presidency to another .
hopefully , this progress will continue with the new presidency .
almost 20 people on the list have the possibility to speak .
today , we can say that the lisbon treaty is now fully operational .
by way of conclusion , i would like to highlight three element .
we all fought hard for the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
( fr ) what ha been said is indeed correct .
all the best to your country and all the best to you personally .
in addition , belgium had to deal with domestic problem during it presidency .
the presidency took on the role of a mediator .
the eurovignette is a further significant achievement of the belgian presidency .
may the good of the community always be our priority .
merger of public limited liability company ( codified version ) (
ec-west african economic and monetary union air service agreement (
agriculture a a strategic sector in the context of food security (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
we will now proceed to the explanation of vote .
the benefit of this initiative will be felt throughout europe .
i therefore want to thank mr stihler for this excellent report .
i am sure that you can spot the problem in his reasoning here .
the spell is breaking and the shamanistic incantation are losing their force .
in europe , 16 % of citizen still live below the poverty line .
however , this doe not justify school fruit and milk programme .
nor doe it justify more market-supported milk subsidy programme .
however , i feel that there is going to be a problem .
there are a number of thing that we must do .
we must have a strong budget for the common agricultural policy .
clearly , food security is one of the fundamental element of agriculture .
this is why i , too , supported this report .
the insistence on efficiency ha somehow overlooked these health requirement .
i hope that we will see more of this trend in local food .
with this in mind , we decided to support the proposal .
i voted for the report like my fellow member did .
the proposal ha no impact on the eu budget and is uncontroversial .
these blind method have just demonstrated their limitation in tunisia .
euro-mediterranean agreement are gaining ever increasing significance in europe 's association activity .
for these reason , we did not vote for this report .
african country situated in particularly difficult geographic and climatic region require special treatment .
it prevents unfair , monopolistic practice and eas travel for ordinary citizen .
in writing . - i voted to give consent to this agreement .
the incentive set up by the commission do nothing to hide this .
the agreement negotiated by the commission wa provisionally applied on 30 november 2009 .
the current economic recession ha severely harmed this sector .
for this reason , i have decided to support mr stihler 's recommendation .
the functioning of the internal market is still limited by numerous barrier .
in this respect , the new regulation will mean a major improvement .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the regulation .
however , the crisis ha hit this sector hard .
this can create fairer condition that would benefit everyone involved .
the harmonisation measure in the report are too extensive .
parliament 's first reading took place during the previous parliamentary term .
i believe that the construction sector broadly reflects the economic situation .
therefore , it is rather premature to talk of a steady recovery .
this is important a we look to the future .
however , construction remains one of the most dangerous area of work .
the european consensus on humanitarian aid is major step forward .
i also agree with the effective application of a european rapid-intervention capability .
consequently , i voted in favour of this report .
the humanitarian dimension ha an important place in this major project .
we should also create a european rapid reaction force for all these crisis .
i voted against the report on humanitarian aid for two reason .
the european union is the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid .
it contribution represents more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
parliament ha tackled this issue at several sitting , particularly through our speech .
the humanitarian context ha changed profoundly in recent year .
natural disaster have certainly been occurring with increasingly severity in recent time .
it 'saves some 140 million people every year ' .
we must increase the focus on disaster risk prevention .
the european union is the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid .
it contribution represents more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
we therefore need to make a greater effort to bolster it visibility .
it contribution represents more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
it contribution represents more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
this is a critical issue for our poultry sector .
food price rise have hit the most vulnerable section of the population hardest .
europe can contribute to global food security by becoming more competitive .
environmental issue add to the complexity and scale of the problem .
79 million people in the eu still live below the poverty line .
the eu should not interfere with school milk or school fruit programme .
leave that to member state , if they so desire .
no link ha yet been demonstrated between genetic modification and higher yield .
farmer obviously need substantial direct support , including in the future .
agriculture play a key role in the development of community .
this new policy should therefore be part of a global vision .
900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty .
i voted in favour of mr sârbu 's report .
however , the title of the report is misleading .
you have made progress , but there is still some way to go .
under no circumstance must we allow food price speculation .
financial and economic criterion can not , therefore , be deciding factor .
even more important , however , is the ability to produce food .
this report reaffirms food security a a basic human right .
the financialisation of the agricultural market is not fundamentally called into question .
worse still , authorisation of genetically modified variety are emerging .
thus , food security continues to require a strong common agricultural policy .
on the other hand , the rapporteur advocate the use of gmos .
accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with .
we therefore chose to abstain in the final vote .
in fact , the future cap absolutely must do more for young farmer .
that is crucial to maintaining production in the eu .
speculative behaviour account for almost 50 % of recent price increase .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the question time with the president of the commission .
there is only one sentence in this document about the efsf .
it is also about structural reform , fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing measure .
the commission is ready to address these issue on 4 february .
your new annual growth survey promise more of the same .
all the focus seems to be on labour market .
on top of this , boris nemtsov wa arrested on 31 december .
so what joint action can the eu institution take on this matter ?
i think urgent action from the european institution is needed .
the situation can not continue a it is now in the russian federation .
in every area , it violates principle that apply in europe and beyond .
i could continue , but i will stop there .
why have there still not been any infringement proceeding ?
my criticism is also backed up by existing jurisprudence in this field .
we have some concern about hungary 's medium law .
i have personally taken up this issue with prime minister orbán .
the medium have taken a great interest in this in the meantime .
yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and chancellor merkel .
that is the public perception , in any case .
so , in fact , there wa no contradiction .
such a dialogue is fully in accordance with all international standard .
i think we should respect our institution , namely the independent institution .
this is , in fact , an exercise in transparency .
the european union may rightfully be proud of israel .
what are you telling the board of the jerusalem local authority , then ?
i think they also deserve our attention and support .
resource are scarce , mr president , and not everything can be done .
which of these priority is or are a priority for the commission ?
this is also a way to have renewables and energy efficiency .
cancún wa a significant step in the climate negotiation .
so far , they have not committed to it .
we are indeed proposing this for the next european council .
president of the commission . - we are pushing for that .
we are trying to put the issue forward for the next european council .
energy efficiency is still lagging behind , a you said .
if not , we will at least propose binding legislation .
the issue here are the environment and power generation .
the commission ha currently proposed a period of five year .
is the commission prepared to reduce the time accordingly ?
research and innovation are vital to drive the competitiveness of our economy .
it wa cambridge university , based in the region i represent .
what is the commission doing to implement those reform ?
mr figueiredo , you know our position on budgetary consolidation .
we must , if you will pardon the phrase , make solidarity operational .
however , the approach need to be more holistic .
we are always particularly interested in the big picture .
we are going to make proposal on that matter to the european council .
your report estimate that the cost will be approximately eur 200 billion .
improvement to these network will be carried out until 2020 .
that is why we are now proposing , for instance , unbundling .
renewable energy source exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste .
i can not know the detail of all the infringement procedure .
having said that , the commission ha certain obligation under the euratom treaty .
mr president , you are bringing an optimistic message from azerbaijan and turkmenistan .
having said that , there are still problem to address .
our thanks to you , mr president of the commission .
the directive now set clear rule for the mobility of patient within europe .
how and based on what criterion can one be reimbursed ?
all the answer to these question now appear in the draft directive .
this will mean that patient receive clear and accurate information .
the path towards today 's successful conclusion wa far from easy .
the court recognised the right of patient mobility under the treaty .
it is the legislator 's role to decide how to deliver such right .
allow me now to share with you some view on the directive .
lastly , the directive lay the foundation for european collaboration on health .
i believe such centre can lead to better healthcare for our citizen .
my sincere thanks and congratulation go to everyone involved .
mr president , lady and gentleman , this legislation is actually superfluous .
we have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare disease .
there ha been nothing of this kind available in the past .
there are some individual beacon of excellence , but no coordination .
of course , there are also thing that make me feel sad .
i hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency .
i come from a country where i can feel relatively relaxed .
the parliament remained united and stayed firm during the negotiation with the council .
let me just mention one example : quality and safety .
the initial proposal from the commission ha been significantly watered down .
i would therefore like to ask mr dalli the following question .
the new directive treat healthcare a a piece of commercially tradeable good .
this proposal , however , will maintain the existing two-tier healthcare system .
it may even be a matter of life or death .
this also concern the fundamental idea of european cooperation - free movement .
yesterday , someone called for the introduction of advance notification in sweden .
implement this so that we strengthen patient ' right instead of reducing them .
cross-border treatment now represents 1 % of total health expenditure in europe .
mr president , commissioner , our work is not finished .
first of all , what doe 'a reasonable time ' mean ?
it would not be acceptable for administrative difficulty to diminish patient ' right .
however , the directive will have to be implemented by the national government .
i am thinking of certain disease in particular , such a rare disease .
( pl ) mr president , there are no ideal law .
i am in favour of patient receiving healthcare close to where they live .
that being said , this proposal is the best that we can achieve .
this is not an issue that we need to concern ourselves with .
i am perhaps a little more cautious about it than some member are .
my own country , ireland , is included here .
the truth is that people would prefer to be treated close to home .
we were guided by this purpose in our work .
obviously , it is the patient who must come to u .
these reservation are not an indication of romania 's opposition to cross-border healthcare .
on the other hand , investment offer a mean of reducing this risk .
i would like to thank them very much for all their effort .
however , we have a firm , well-designed foundation on which to build .
this is a major step forward , particularly with regard to rare disease .
every member state ha a different level of facility .
this directive is for all european who need healthcare .
we are now going to start the catch-the-eye procedure .
i have 17 people who have asked for the floor .
it can have fundamental consequence for member state ' health system .
i congratulate the rapporteur and john bowis for a job well done .
therefore , i will respect the arrangement and speak for just one minute .
this wa a very interesting debate and , personally speaking , very instructive .
i would like to highlight four of it element .
this is very important in the case of rare disease .
this can be accomplished by defining the clearest and most practical rule possible .
prescription issued in one member state are not always recognised in other country .
the regulation thus represents a significant step towards patient mobility in the eu .
the road to the final agreement wa very long .
( el ) mr president , cross-border healthcare is a necessity nowadays .
this is a challenge that we need to address ...
i am very pleased to see this directive being adopted .
i will conclude by saying that tomorrow 's vote is essential .
we could say that this is a small step in the right direction .
in some case , prompt cross-border medical assistance can save life .
member state retain full responsibility for organising and managing social security system .
a person suffering from alzheimer 's can not go one hour unaccompanied .
the committee is initiating the procedure during this legislative term .
dementia mean great suffering for million of european and their family .
action to support people suffering from dementia could be developed in this context .
a good example could be the ongoing parliament initiative on carers .
in this case , there is no formal commission decision .
his claim , however , were rejected by the german court .
the fact that all these are carried out at national level increase fragmentation .
one of those statistic wa my own mother who passed away last year .
i therefore strongly welcome this european initiative on dementia .
this is clearly specified in point 21 of our resolution .
helping these patient also mean getting the diagnosis right .
medical progress is making medicine more and more expensive .
the case we are dealing with here is different .
this manufacturer ha been denied access to the market for 14 year .
we came to you and spoke to you personally .
i wrote you another letter , but i have received no reply .
you have also tried to prevent the next debate .
that is not the way the commission should act .
the effect are common but everyone 's experience is different .
legislation is clearly secondary in what primarily need local support .
why doe the commission favour the big pharmaceutical company and their lobbyist ?
sixteen thousand of those live in my constituency in northern ireland .
here wa an innovative manufacturer which developed an inhaler for asthmatic .
the manufacturer quite rightly won an award for it .
commissioner , i am not in the business of apportioning blame .
i particularly welcome the focus on a multidisciplinary approach .
alzheimer 's disease and dementia are a very big issue for society .
the number of alzheimer 's patient is thought to double every 20 year .
i hope that it will not divide this sitting .
i have heard people say that more resource are needed for research .
people do not work together and do not talk to each other .
they must have faith , they are not alone .
that is why we need research , research , and more research .
we need to know how to take preventive action .
what can we do in the future to combat alzheimer 's ?
i would like to touch on two thing in this short time .
first of all , the importance of prevention and early diagnosis .
the greatest burden usually fall on patient ' relative and family member .
this is mainly an ageing-related issue , but not simply an ageing-related issue .
i have been looking into this case since spring 2007 .
in autumn 2007 , i addressed a question to the commission .
a you can appreciate , these statistic are disturbing .
( da ) mr president , i would like to address commissioner dalli .
here you see the plastic gadget that this is all about .
this is what ha to undergo the major testing .
the plastic gadget is just like using a syringe .
it ha never created any problem other than financial ...
the commission welcome parliament 's report and it recommendation .
that is the extent of the clinical test that were requested .
why is there a resistance to providing these clinical test ?
if it is , do these medicine require different dosage ?
is there an adjustment system in the device to adjust the dosage ?
this is the kind of thing the authority have been asking themselves .
it ha been said that i promised to look into the case .
i have had a lot of detail about the case .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( wednesday , 19 january 2011 ) .
i totally agree that eu health policy should prioritise dementia .
alzheimer 's disease represents 50 % of these case .
there are 44 000 people in ireland with dementia .
disease causing memory loss are a common problem in europe .
approximately 10 million european suffer from them at the present time .
many factor influence people 's ability to remember thing and learn something new .
unfortunately , those that exist do not now meet the demand .
every one in five european will contract a disease that cause memory loss .
these figure will continue to rise a a result of increasing life expectancy .
the next item is question time ( b7-0001/2011 ) .
any support for productive investment ha to be seen in that context .
however , i would like to make a further comment .
( lt ) mr president , i have the following question .
last november , the commission established a specialised investment vehicle .
lastly , the commission will promote information about the progress microfinance facility .
i am interested where these additional fund came from .
supplying information , ensuring that information reach people , is very important .
thank you very much for your interest and your comment .
subject : additional support measure for smes under tourism policy
parliament will receive the updated text in a few week ' time .
what exactly ha been achieved in this area over the year ?
the same problem exists with regard to china , i believe .
however , youth unemployment and under-employment are unacceptably high today .
of course , the effort to improve employability begin well before higher education .
many will work in job that do not yet exist .
many will need advanced linguistic , intercultural and entrepreneurial skill .
young people are confronted with an increased number of educational choice .
they need to be able to take informed decision .
we are now starting to implement the various part of this strategy .
europe need to be better at anticipating the skill need of tomorrow .
however , i would like to pose an additional question .
the european union must guarantee all citizen the right to quality higher education .
that is why we want to have transparency in the record of university .
the oecd 's pisa survey is an important resource for these exchange .
i intend to launch the high-level group on literacy on 1 february .
an ec-eib proposal on the issue is expected in 2011 .
another pillar from the digital agenda is dedicated to digital skill .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your very detailed reply .
member of the commission . - mr president , the answer is yes .
must every member state implement this service correctly and in it entirety ?
the line taken by the honourable member make sense .
the hotline itself is the least part of the problem .
good progress ha also been made by austria on the northern access route .
the one-track section will be upgraded and the whole section will be electrified .
( de ) thank you for your kind answer , commissioner .
i have not received any information about these trouble .
about the munich-mühldorf-freilassing-salzburg priority project number 17 , it is ongoing .
it is fully funded by the german recovery plan .
this report is published on the europa road safety website .
we hope that member state will deal with this issue adequately .
it is extremely important to have cooperation between the different member state .
one of the new phenomenon on european road is people texting while driving .
it appears that the united kingdom is now intending to opt in .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:15 and resumed at 21:00 )
we offer our condolence to the family of the victim , luca sanna .
we promised them our help , and we stand by our promise .
the eu is a critical part of the global solidarity effort for haiti .
we stand ready to provide more if more help is necessary .
for 2011 , our priority will be housing , sanitation and healthcare .
we are also supporting commissioner piebalgs in linking relief to rehabilitation and development .
out of this pledge , we have already committed eur 327 million .
new programme were put in place to address additional need .
disbursement strictly linked to the pledge amounted to eur 74 million in 2010 .
aid worker and technical expert were often working in quite difficult condition .
where can we learn lesson in order to improve the situation ?
progress ha been achieved and million of life have been saved .
otherwise , the effort made so far risk being compromised .
new election under close international supervision are the only viable , democratic solution .
i recognise that that can not happen in a few month .
that is the task that we see before u .
we can not allow this to happen in haiti .
i therefore wish commissioner georgieva and piebalgs all the best in this endeavour .
we have to depoliticise our argument and be practical about helping these people .
cuba 's aid is considered by many expert to be particularly effective .
the international community ha promised usd 11.5 billion for the country 's reconstruction .
it remains to be seen what is meant by reconstruction .
how much of this aid ha actually arrived in the field ?
yet , progress ha been made , step by step .
( pl ) madam president , the european union ha not forgotten haiti .
we are still the largest source of humanitarian aid .
in this regard , our plan are progressing well .
we respect these priority of the people of haiti .
the debris need to be cleared from the street .
at the rate we are going , we will need another five year .
the commission is doing good work - very good work , in fact .
we must not , however , subcontract all public service to ngo .
i want to say a number of thing tonight .
this is where the problem ha not moved forward .
i listened to the commissioner and he is quite right .
wonderful people smiling and you wondered why they were able to smile .
in actual fact , port-au-prince is a vast refugee camp at the moment .
the haitian population is only surviving thanks to the humanitarian organisation ' effort .
indeed , we must be grateful to these organisation .
all this creates the need to rebuild the haitian state .
the first problem is probably building an acceptable sanitation system .
this is , without doubt , a huge and very complex humanitarian operation .
president , that is the upside of the story .
what additional and more effective action can be taken there ?
my third point , madam president , is the political aspect .
secondly , the cholera epidemic , which ha already been mentioned here .
there is a shortage of drinking water , food and other basic material .
we must therefore take step towards limiting these appalling act .
it is unacceptable that some aid ha still failed to arrived .
in closing , i would like to make five point .
what is it that we are very worried about ?
but we should not be somehow misled by this .
we finance security in quite difficult condition through the government .
the fund should not be misused and it take time for budget support .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 january 2011 .
it is not only italy that ha major problem with regard to waste .
many conflict are arising and recently , the situation ha only got worse .
the problem is that there is a lack of political will .
therefore , our group take a clear position on this matter .
we saw many illegal dumping site and burning pile of rubbish .
of course , they need to resolve the situation on the ground themselves .
obviously , the mafia , too , clearly ha a hand in this .
campania could make a huge leap overnight towards becoming a recycling community .
parliament ha truly an important role here and ha assumed it fully .
they are the one sounding the alarm about the full landfill .
the waste would be turned into ash , causing harmful and deadly emission .
this ha been especially true over the last few year .
the court found against italy - again , quite rightly so .
what is happening down there is not a pleasant sunday afternoon stroll .
it would be wrong to consider imposing further penalty .
first , a waste management plan must be drawn up .
however , the commission should also assist in this .
the resource that are available should be blocked until these condition are met .
the subjective behaviour of the state must be taken into account , too .
there can be no denying the will and commitment shown by italy .
the offer made by the eu is good , comprehensible and fair .
we should also encourage the local authority to do this .
we should make this deal with each other and work together .
there are three or four issue which i would like to address .
the situation is critical ; there is no quick fix .
it is not easy but it is more than needed .
i want to be helpfully strict and strictly helpful .
it is a new directive which wa recently adopted .
if they organise themselves in a proper way , they can really change .
i can assure you that we will do it also in the future .
i can guarantee that this will be the case .
the vote will take place during the next part-session .
i think the resolution we have proposed for vote tomorrow is very clear .
we do not need your support , but i hope we have it .
i would appreciate a very clear answer on this .
in my opinion , there is a need to take decisive action .
following the commission 's intervention , this law wa amended in december 2009 .
the commission is continuing to look into this matter .
it is very clear that the union can intervene here .
it is for the member state to define what marriage is .
it is for the european union to permit free movement and non-discrimination .
we will see , but that is what he predicted .
it is revolting to see right-wing politician scapegoating gay people in lithuania .
this is a poisonous slander , designed to confuse and mislead .
parliament ha proposed resolution in this regard on numerous occasion .
it ha always opposed the violation of these right .
the european parliament is already beginning to criticise one of it member state .
this is why we can not endorse this resolution .
this is why our resolution and the eu anti-discrimination directive are so important .
once again , i would like to address my friend mr higgins .
please do not refer to something you have not experienced .
comparing today 's lithuania with the soviet union is simply incomprehensible .
i can only subscribe to the strong position of this parliament .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 19 january 2011 .
international adoption in the eu ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
conclusion of the european council meeting on 16-17 december ( debate )
on economic policy , we reached some important conclusion .
it is an essential piece in our effort to make europe more crisis-proof .
the eu will continue to adhere strictly to standard imf and international practice .
work is going on to develop these element of this overall approach .
the european council also decided to give montenegro the status of candidate country .
innovation and energy - especially energy security - are key in this regard .
these were the conclusion of the last european council .
the commission ha signalled this very clearly in the annual growth survey .
this sharing of information empowers and strengthens national parliament .
first , we need to re-establish stability by consolidating public finance .
but we have to approach this in a sober and well thought-out way .
anyone who truly care about a social europe know this can not continue .
europe 's next budget must be a growth-enhancing budget .
the recovery ha taken hold and is currently progressing in the real economy .
europe 's manufacturing sector ha improved markedly in recent month .
we can not return to the old way of doing thing .
everything possible must be done to stabilise and strengthen it .
i think we are speaking the same language on this issue .
push hard for this , let u not give in !
let u not be afraid , president van rompuy and president barroso .
just think what would happen if this revision were to fail .
therein lie my second point : much ado about nothing .
you are changing the treaty for a point of law .
i would like the council to speed up , mr van rompuy .
a new year ha started and we have new problem to contend with .
i would like to endorse fully what mr goulard ha said .
the long-term solution doe not lie in bigger government .
you are destroying our service and the living standard of our people .
no , it is not 'failure ' - although it could be .
mr barroso used it , mr van rompuy used it : 'stability ' .
your reassurance that all is well do not work .
who do you think you are kidding , mr van rompuy ?
bond yield in portugal rose to nearly 7 % yesterday .
it appears that this situation will continue for quite some time .
moving then to creating the condition for growth and employment .
do you remember asking for a 6 % budget increase for the eu ?
mr president , the eu can not be trusted .
would that have improved the current situation in europe ?
no economist would agree with you on that , mr farage .
you can not simply say that we are living in the past .
we are dealing now with issue that concern europe today .
greece , portugal and ireland do not fit inside the euro .
regarding eurobonds , many issue have been set out here today .
were they capable of providing a panel of eminent person ?
you have been asked to manage the euro crisis .
this is the real issue at stake here today .
only the timing is under discussion : whether and when needed and how .
let the medium and analyst be under no illusion .
the eu will introduce all that is needed , when it is needed .
we can see that economic potential in itself is not sufficient .
this could be a real chance to boost european competitiveness in the world .
a single digital market also requires determined effort to develop a service market .
the first thought concern the scope of the permanent crisis management mechanism .
secondly , i would like to draw your attention to the national parliament .
will it be the european parliament or the national parliament ?
this is a question that i put to you .
the hungarian presidency ha begun the preparation for the energy summit .
the most important rule have already been laid down last year .
the regulation on the security of natural gas supply ha entered into force .
obviously , the united state of america is printing new money .
unfortunately , this nightmare about it collapse is now the main trend .
it is very odd that it should be weak on these matter .
the commission should therefore prioritise issue relating to a social europe .
if they are , they will be seen a hero .
we have seen that threat in this debate today .
we have not only the european institution ; we have 27 democracy .
the task we have in front of u is extremely difficult .
we need structural reform in europe , including in the labour sector .
i said it yesterday , i reaffirm it today .
once again , let me make clear the position of the commission .
we are for the most ambitious position in term of integrated response .
finally , i think everybody ha to make a contribution .
that is an important thing , that is a question of credibility .
this is indeed something that market are asking of u .
i apologise for appearing positive every now and then .
who would have believed that in 2008 or in 2009 ?
at that time , no one said that the euro wa at risk .
i wanted to highlight this before moving on to other point .
we virtually had to make them up on the spot .
there wa a stability and growth pact which wa not observed .
that is far more important than progress made separately .
we will get there by this gradual , progressive approach .
i am convinced that we are heading in the right direction .
i am convinced that there is a common will .
i am convinced that we will make it in the end .
therefore , both member state and the european commission have a great responsibility .
the last european council showed this clearly once again .
not one word wa uttered on the cause of all of this .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
the programme of activity of the hungarian presidency of the council ( debate )
today , we will discus the programme of activity of the hungarian presidency .
for you , of course , this is a six-monthly routine .
however , creating and maintaining european unity need strength too .
the only question is from where europe can draw such strength .
what is impeding the competitiveness of our entire civilisation today ?
quite the contrary ; our true problem is a very practical one .
lady and gentleman , everyone agrees on the diagnosis of debt .
to u , debating european politician , it is like a disease .
the hungarian presidency will do everything in it power to this end .
i would like to ask for your committed cooperation in this regard .
this will be crucial for the credibility of our presidency programme .
shared goal can only be based on shared value .
there can be no backtracking and no return to business a usual .
so i am pleased that the presidency 's priority fully reflect this .
it proper implementation will be a major task in the month ahead .
the commission kick-started the semester by adopting the annual growth survey last week .
these include the energy agenda 2020 , our communication on energy infrastructure priority .
negotiation with croatia are now in the final phase .
this will require an all-out push on croatia 's side .
the new presidency will also put the spotlight on our danube strategy .
the commission welcome the presidency 's commitment to this strategy .
finally , the debate on cohesion policy will intensify in the coming month .
it is encouraging that prime minister orbán himself will participate .
effectiveness and european added value must be the driving principle of the reform .
i count on the support of the presidency in this work .
it is our common interest and responsibility to make funding more effective .
only in this way can we defend an ambitious budget for cohesion policy .
prime minister orbán ha just said he is a politician .
i hope that prime minister orbán will take this into consideration .
let u make hungary closer to europe and europe closer to hungary .
mr orbán , you have won the confidence of your electorate in hungary .
indeed , both hungary and poland are both entitled to join it .
they therefore have a stake in ensuring the stability of this currency .
it also depends on greater flexibility in our employment market and greater productivity .
thank you , already , for what you did in december !
this man is the leader of my party , gyula horn .
i would like to look at two element of the medium law .
you have a two-thirds majority in parliament and it is a legitimate majority .
this is a problem which we need to address quickly .
we also need to focus on employment in the member state .
i told him that he spoke like karl marx in exile .
we can not afford that sort of thing now .
you , mr orbán , can do something yourself to help the situation .
withdraw the law and introduce a new and better one .
we were always running behind the fact , after the event .
the elephant in this beautiful room is naturally the medium law in hungary .
well , márai lived in kassa , which today we know a košice .
the group of the green , and i personally , love hungary .
i cried in 1954 when hungary lost the world cup .
do you think that mr nixon found the watergate information balanced ?
do you think that mr bush found the information about abu ghraib balanced ?
it upset u , too , and sometimes that hurt .
you say that you want a strong europe , prime minister orbán .
a strong europe , prime minister orbán , must be a credible europe .
how are we going to have discussion with china ?
a democracy never died from having too many freedom .
democracy died when people started restricting freedom , prime minister orbán .
you see , then , that what i am telling you is right .
i want to finish on one thing , prime minister orbán .
we are with you for the world 's christian .
these are the common value of europe that we must all defend together .
an excessive , discriminative , and structurally distorting crisis tax .
support to the wealthy to the detriment of the poor .
dissolution of the budgetary council , just like in venezuela .
impairment , and soon , revocation of central bank autonomy .
a 98 % special tax on severance payment with retroactive effect .
nine amendment of the constitution over the course of seven month .
populist hacking , a though going at a botanical garden with an axe .
destruction of the fine fabric of society , of it solidarity .
now we are facing the risk of the very opposite .
i , a a hungarian , will have none of this shame .
it is not too late to reverse our direction .
look at how they are trying to bully you this morning .
they are trying to tell you how to run your own country .
at that time , this wa our historic mission .
in today 's world , lie and oppression rest on two pillar .
i wish the best of luck to hungary , my freedom-loving home country .
however , whether that suit mr orbán is another matter .
there ha been mention here today of your predecessor named marx .
what he said about justice is no longer referred to here .
you are the greatest oppressor of the working people .
this is also proven by the six month of the upcoming hungarian presidency .
is your goal perhaps to weaken the hungarian presidency in doing so ?
prime minister , you are a man of purpose .
and this criticism is especially not directed at the hungarian people .
we last met at his funeral service in december 2009 .
you attended a a private individual and we very much appreciated that .
you have responded to the criticism of the medium law with two argument .
the assessment must take a political form and it must be completed quickly .
your second argument is that the criticism is unspecific .
that is what the criminal law is there for .
please let the criminal law take effect in this case .
member state are turning a blind eye to what each other is doing .
even hungary is asking everyone to keep their nose out of it business .
that is a strange attitude for a presidency of the european union .
the whole matter of the medium law show the hypocrisy of these attack .
they are in an honourable place , adorning the president 's table .
this is why i see this a a double standard .
yes , we must bring up the matter of the slovak language law .
yes , we must bring up the matter of annulling the beneš decree .
yes , we must bring up the territorial autonomy of the székely people .
these are the real problem and i wish you success for the presidency .
the electorate ha given you a clear mandate to do this .
you will have the active support of parliament and of my group .
this hypocritical approach must not gain a majority in this house .
i do not think that this is what you want .
my second point concern the state medium law in north rhine-westphalia .
is eu enlargement in a eurosceptic context and an economic crisis actually realistic ?
in conclusion , i wish u all good luck .
where a single political party dominates , other voice grow silent .
we must guarantee that all this remains within the limit of affordability .
we will be your partner in solving these issue .
the first of these value is the fight against all form of nationalism .
the second of these european value is the defence of democracy and freedom .
this is the message of firmness that we are now awaiting .
should anyone doubt the fact , we have a political europe .
you are putting the economy of hungary right , mr orbán .
you are probably the prime minister we need at this time .
it is not the first time you have done this , though .
i will end by drawing your attention to croatia .
do not forget that you were minister for justice .
the southern corridor should obviously include the nabucco project .
i wish you best of luck for these tremendous task .
in europe , we have freedom of the press .
however , it should not respond hesitantly , half-heartedly and defensively .
instead it should take rapid , decisive and effective action .
i can imagine that this doe not always feel good .
that is what i would like to ask you .
i hope that you will succeed in your objective .
in your submission i heard nothing about a review of neighbourhood policy .
i take the liberty of disagreeing with mr cohn-bendit .
these are all area where we want to and intend to support you .
this is important and it is also the right thing to do .
we can not accept thing moving in this direction .
next , moving to the four priority of the hungarian presidency .
what specific action are you going to take on that ?
we in europe are currently up to our neck in water .
mutatis mutandis , something similar is taking place today .
this is apparent in the context of the medium law .
i come from austria and i wa born close to the hungarian border .
i wa assigned to teach two of my classmate german .
i know all about the significance of the revolution .
it aim wa to bring about freedom , including freedom of the press .
it mean reinforcing democracy in europe and it mean a community of europe .
the process of making europe stronger begin at home .
party are simply the instrument of democracy and not the other way around .
our weakness are nationalism , egoism , polarisation and protectionism .
the new unity government should truly represent the wish of tunisian society .
we believe that together , we can further the european project .
i wish the presidency all the best for the next six month .
we are looking forward to working together for the benefit of europe .
first , i will don the hat of hungarian prime minister .
and the list could go on and on and on .
i am shocked to see how much you are living in the past .
i wa here and heard it with my own ear .
i wa here and heard it with my own ear !
you threatened me , claiming that hungary wa moving towards becoming a dictatorship .
what is this if not an insult to the hungarian people ?
let me tell you that this will all depend on you .
not that we are happy about it , of course .
i am well aware that we will be having serious political debate .
mr schulz ha asked to make such a personal statement .
you have also spoken directly to some other member of this house .
mr cohn-bendit ha described in his biography his relationship with the hungarian people .
no one who criticises a law is insulting the hungarian people .
we can not create a successful europe by dismembering it .
prime minister , thank you for your speech and for your presence .
mr cohn-bendit , do you wish to make a personal statement a well ?
mr cohn-bendit , it must be a personal statement .
( fr ) are you going to be quiet up there ?
this is unworthy of the european union , mr orbán .
i have lost my appetite now ; i will not dine with you .
under what rule wa mr schulz allowed to give a speech ?
are all meps equal or are some meps more equal than others ?
the issue which have been raised in the chamber have been clarified .
you are making the exit from the crisis your top priority .
the french presidency of the g20 is an opportunity that must be grasped .
a united europe should set an example to it foreign partner .
thanks to it , we maintain stable relationship with our closest neighbour .
what do you intend to do to revive it ?
that is the only way to break free of party political game .
medium pluralism and freedom of the press are fundamental european value .
any self-respecting democrat must accept criticism of his or her political action .
nobody can deny that the hungarian presidency took a turbulent start .
i note with regret that this wa not the case .
this issue is exceptionally important to the bulgarian socialist and all bulgarian citizen .
this should also include a plan for the baltic sea energy connection network .
good cooperation will facilitate smooth hand-overs of the presidency between the polish-cypriot-danish trio .
i am confident of the hungarian presidency 's support on this matter .
it is normal to expect a reply in line with eu rule .
the support of the hungarian presidency is required in this process .
sport is one of the priority of the hungarian presidency .
the central motto of the presidency a a whole is 'strong europe ' .
the map in question is that of europe in 1848 .
i shall watch it work with all the more interest for this reason .
hungary is taking over the council presidency from belgium .
these two member state could not be more different .
the hungarian presidency ha presented a comprehensive list of priority .
interim partnership agreement between the ec and the pacific state ( vote )
interim partnership agreement between the ec and the pacific state (
stabilisation and association agreement between the ec and serbia (
i urge all my colleague to support this amendment .
european initiative on alzheimer 's disease and other dementia (
situation in haiti one year after the earthquake : humanitarian aid and reconstruction (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i think that it is a good day for the patient of europe .
( pl ) madam president , european society is becoming ever more mobile .
nevertheless , this will not , in fact , affect very many european .
there are still a few matter that need to be ironed out .
the burden fall chiefly on my constituent in london .
this would also be an opportunity to exchange best practice .
it is wonderful to see you in the chair .
all of those that are currently taking all our job ?
is the eu failing european worker in this regard too ?
yes , there are many family willing to give loving home to child .
we need to promote union policy designed to overcome difficult family situation .
i welcome the motion for a resolution voted on today on international adoption .
in this case , both parent and child lose out .
that is why we are in favour of this motion for a resolution .
international adoption is , of course , vitally important .
they are friend , and everyone is well aware of that .
for that reason , my party support the continuation of this dialogue .
madam president , this is very good news indeed .
therefore , i am using this minute to make a few point .
what part doe the food we eat play in the disease ?
what part doe the stress of life play in the disease ?
what part do our gene play in the disease ?
why do twice a many woman a men contract the disease ?
you are talking about prevention , diagnosis , treatment and cure .
we have come a long way down the road .
but now let u look at the situation a year on .
why ha only 5 % of the rubble been taken away ?
when you have an earthquake , huge chunk of masonry fall .
it is in nobody 's interest if the situation is politicised .
( nl ) mr president , lithuania is a sovereign member state .
the country 's president ha blocked similar proposal twice already .
yet , the majority of the european parliament have seized on this matter .
there is no way i can support such arrogance .
this right of a sovereign state can not be interfered with from outside .
the text adopted lack the most important point of view .
the title of the resolution includes an absurdity a well .
but the point is i am not a lithuanian legislator .
i voted in favour of this report for these reason .
the european union is taking an important step with the new legislation .
in writing . - i support this proposal on cross-border healthcare .
healthcare should never be treated a a commercial market service .
the text that we adopted on wednesday is more consensual .
however , any refusal to grant authorisation will have to be justified .
this is one more step towards a more concrete europe of health .
you can receive treatment in another member state only in emergency .
this directive is for all european who need healthcare .
therefore , i have decided to support mr grossetête 's recommendation .
in the end , i voted for the directive on cross-border healthcare .
hence , the issue of cross-border healthcare is clearly a crucial one .
i welcome the directive on patient ' right in cross-border healthcare .
patient should be comprehensively informed about the procedure for accessing treatment abroad .
i voted in favour of adopting the grossetête report for several key reason .
the issue of authorisation ha given rise to much debate .
a key exception is the case of individual with rare disease .
it is particularly timely given the widespread labour mobility within the eu .
this is particularly important in case of complicated or rare health problem .
this will guarantee the quality and safety of the healthcare treatment and service .
each member state is responsible for providing it citizen with healthcare .
for all these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
this is the price to be paid for health .
patient , too , have the right to benefit from freedom of movement .
it is in area like this that europe can contribute significant added value .
i can not support such a concept of healthcare .
the market value of good made from timber is also considerable .
independent verification procedure are also provided for by these agreement .
it sell 80 % of sawn timber to the eu .
these , amongst others , are some of the reason behind our abstention .
the eu must act in this regard by taking direct and decisive measure .
most of the criterion derived from vpa definition have been met .
we must not allow abuse and the destruction of the environment to continue .
an effective and transparent monitoring system need to be established .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
i am definitely in favour of these two agreement .
a vpa ha already been signed between the eu and ghana in 2009 .
this year , 2011 , is the international year of forest .
that is why i voted in favour of the original text proposed .
the resolution explains parliament 's doubt about the interim economic partnership agreement .
this is important for regional solidarity , cohesion and integration .
the millennium development goal will be achieved through this interim agreement .
the resolution explains parliament 's doubt about the interim economic partnership agreement .
regional integration is crucial in the development of these country .
the interest of the local economy are paramount here .
in my opinion this is a step forward for development and prosperity .
the interim agreement cover rule of origin and market access issue .
these agreement are further proof of the neo-colonialism of the european union .
last but not least , fiji doe not have a democratic regime .
our shadow , josé bové , tabled 11 amendment in that regard .
we must protect the welfare of each child and defend their interest .
the adoption of child is a particularly sensitive issue .
we should devote a real law to international adoption .
all child should be guaranteed the right to be adopted .
foreign adoption also take place in my own country of poland .
this is neither an adequate nor serious basis for adoptive parenthood , however .
serbia ha received encouragement with the vote on the stabilisation and association agreement .
however , it must receive equal treatment with regard to this path .
i therefore feel that the country should continue towards achieving this goal .
the progress already made in the reform process is praiseworthy .
i believe that those country ' membership will eventually be achieved .
i would congratulate serbia on the progress achieved in the reform process .
i am voting against this text out of solidarity with the serbian people .
serbia is showing serious lapse in the field of respect for human right .
the case of the boy from temerin ha still not been investigated .
the eu is serbia 's main trading partner , which speaks volume .
i voted for the resolution on serbia 's integration .
i would congratulate serbia on the progress achieved in the reform process .
i welcome the stabilisation agreement between the eu and serbia .
given our view on enlargement , we abstained from this report .
these issue have not been put to other country in similar position .
serbia submitted it bid for eu membership in december 2009 .
i urge the other 16 to do so a soon a possible .
serbia ha made progress in the field of the environment .
the main element of the acquis on renewable energy remain to be transposed .
the country need to adopt a legislative framework on energy efficiency .
however , that accession is bound by a series of condition .
in recent year , serbia ha made major progress in moving towards europe .
the number of people affected is expected to rise significantly .
scientist admit that this figure could double over the next 20 year .
i support the rapporteur and voted in favour of her proposal .
the focus should be on early diagnosis and prevention of alzheimer 's disease .
scientific study suggest that this figure could double every 20 year .
i fully support this project on alzheimer 's disease and other dementia disease .
at the same time , the symptom of the disease become more acute .
frequently , the burden of care fall on family member .
there are 50 000 people in ireland caring daily for dementia sufferer .
this figure is likely to double virtually every 20 year .
in france , there are 160 000 new sufferer each year .
above all , we must highlight the importance of preventing the disease .
alzheimer 's disease is a major challenge to european society .
this make it even more important to start treatment at an early stage .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the matias report .
it is important to act in a global way .
a yet , no cure ha been found for alzheimer 's disease .
alzheimer 's disease is responsible for more than half of these case .
in poland , over 200 000 people suffer from alzheimer 's disease .
alzheimer 's disease is a major economic challenge for all society .
we need a joint european strategy in the fight against dementia .
those caring for patient should be guaranteed appropriate financial and psychological support .
i have voted emphatically in favour of this own-initiative report on alzheimer 's .
these comment should be included in the policy a well .
better coordination between the member state is essential too .
a a result , we will be faced with a major challenge .
in summary , this is the reason for my vote .
if a product ha a ce mark , then it fulfils these requirement .
in writing . - with the adoption of this resolution , the ep :
asthma attack cause sudden breathing difficulty that can even last for hour .
europe , in turn , can launch a similar programme for haiti .
the majority in parliament ha said nothing about these fact .
the situation in haiti continues to be a cause for great concern .
action must be taken to ensure long-term development in haiti .
the resolution emphasis issue such a protection of human right and dignity .
in writing . - haiti is again a matter of urgency .
these word must inspire u to make an ever greater commitment .
the lithuanian authority are in the process of considering these change .
equality between citizen is a principle that europe compromise on too often .
we would like to see it respond every time this principle is flouted .
i welcome it and it certainly ha my vote .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
situation of christian in the context of freedom of religion ( debate )
i would like to ask vice-president/high representative catherine ashton to take the floor .
the victim do not belong to a single faith or to one region .
the european union will not turn a blind eye to their plight .
christian europe must take a self-confident approach and defend itself .
we must not accept violent discrimination or act of terrorism .
we can not talk about minority in this case .
mr president , baroness ashton , thank you for your clear statement .
however , there is also intolerance between different muslim group .
europe ought to set an example on tolerance and intercommunity dialogue .
otherwise , we can not expect our policy in this area to succeed .
this house fight for the right of people to emigrate .
action , including military action , is needed to fight and prevent it .
this freedom wa persecuted in atrocious way by the communist regime .
it is right that we should condemn atrocious killing perpetrated by fanatic .
it is not only a matter of extremism , however .
conversion to christianity is forbidden or even punishable by death .
in particular , legislation supposedly aimed at repressing blasphemy must be repealed .
we are now about to adopt the agreement on iraq .
our determination to defend them should be no le .
for others they are value in their own right .
either way , they are value that we should promote and respect .
secondly , the european union ha signed bilateral agreement with all those country .
freeze those agreement , put them on ice this very day !
we believe that this resolution is a step in the wrong direction .
no , the same problem exists there , a well ' .
this is an acid test of our european spiritual value .
they usually remain silent about their daily problem in order to avoid difficulty .
this attack on conviction is more aggressive towards christianity in certain quarter .
our sympathy also go to their friend and family .
we must make a commitment to ensuring the right to freedom of religion .
this must lie at the heart of our bilateral relationship .
there is , therefore , no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect .
it is important to repeat the appeal made by religious community .
i would like to recount a short incident that i find significant .
today , however , eastern christian community need protection .
european foreign policy should not remain powerless while the world change .
it should not be afraid to say the word ...
no one should be persecuted because of their religious belief .
this incident is now being considered by the un .
europe need to wake up , open it eye and take concrete action .
wake up , wretched europe , and remember your christian root !
the victim need to be present in our european institution .
this is a deep-seated problem and christophobic act are a reality .
christianity and other religion are peace movement like the european union .
we can not let terrorist use religion a a tool of barbarity .
europe is a mosaic : it unity and diversity are our motto .
ha the turkish representative to the european union been called in ?
so let u not make this a motion against anybody .
it is for christian and for those who are being attacked .
it is time we started to have mutual respect .
we must not allow these people to be driven out of their home .
you can count on the solidarity of parliament in that regard .
iraq , iran , egypt , nigeria , turkey , pakistan .
in northern iraq , people are afraid to adorn their home .
it need to be stopped and it must be stopped .
elsewhere in the world , too , there are challenge .
we want to isolate religion in a private space .
this is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attack .
on the contrary , it is classic mass persecution .
people who have newly adopted christianity are exposed to the risk of death .
christian are among ancient traditional inhabitant in these country .
they have recalled the fact , assessed them and made specific request .
colleague , we now come to the catch-the-eye procedure .
turkey must be condemned for it crime within eu territory .
the european parliament support fundamental freedom and human right all over the world .
in general term , this is not just about the position of christian .
from a liberal perspective , this concern freedom of religion a a whole .
by this i mean all the religion throughout our entire world .
this is precisely the problem of our community today .
i do not quite understand why we are showing our concern today .
we should not be surprised , because the problem start at the top .
baroness ashton , we need courage and we need to maintain our standard .
the ideology of laicism tie our hand and suppresses freedom of religion .
some member also disagreed with religious leader making speech in our parliament .
i want to just pick up two or three thing .
we have funded anti-discrimination ngo in some 60 country .
a number of honourable member indeed raised this a a particular point .
the world 's religion do not encourage violent attack .
those responsible are motivated by fundamentalist and extremist islamist ideology .
this is the very least it should be expected to do .
in 2010 , the number of attack on christian community rose worryingly .
however , we can and should ensure freedom of religion for all european .
we are confronted , regrettably , with a global attack on christianity .
christian are currently persecuted in over 70 country around the world .
certain member state have bilateral cooperation policy , too , of course .
however , we now need to go much further .
in particular , our action need to be much more coordinated .
firstly , we need a political and diplomatic dimension .
you said that the response need to be a regional one .
all that make the situation unsustainable and a real threat to europe .
we therefore need to see a qualitative leap in europe 's initiative .
the issue raised in this discussion are extremely important .
is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism ?
this is an important question when it come to assessing the situation .
i am opposed to security policy which will help to militarise africa .
all these factor have obviously facilitated the spread of illegal trafficking .
it could only do the eu good to be more far-sighted .
the european union ha not acted in this way , though .
the worrying level of insecurity there concern u all .
the first stage would deal with the immediate , urgent situation .
i need to see where best we can lend support .
we need to think about this approach in a very comprehensive way .
however , honourable member , the time ha come to act .
many of those detained in the last few week have been released .
i believe we need to pause in this process .
mr president , this is the framework within which we are currently working .
i am now very interested to hear the view of member of parliament .
the recent presidential election held in belarus in december were not fair .
perhaps there is a problem with the english interpretation .
the authority have still not allowed it to register .
however , i would just warn that this is not good news yet .
we still need confirmation , which may arrive next week .
so why is this 'strike hard ' happening in belarus ?
however , europe should also take some of the blame .
this also includes the immediate release of all political detainee .
sanction have had little effect in the past in belarus and elsewhere .
for example , reduce visa cost for belarusian a soon a possible .
the december election were actually a ritual of re-appointment .
indeed , we said we would wait for the december election .
clearly there is no place for belarus in the eastern partnership .
that would be a tangibly painful reward for the organiser of 19 december .
the hope that these election would be more democratic than the previous one .
that is precisely why the eu should change it policy on belarus .
unfortunately , the policy of rapprochement with the regime ha not worked .
the eu will have to impose sanction on the belarusian leadership .
sanction which will affect , not it citizen , but it leader .
sanction such a withdrawing all visa for the leader and their family .
fortunately , lady ashton seems to be on the right track .
so far , this programme ha not exactly lived up to it promise .
i hope that she ha put her headphone on again .
let u now get down to business , commissioner .
this is a matter where both type of measure should be linked .
we should discontinue doing a little a we did in the past .
did we do all that we should have done ?
no , it wa ridiculously modest assistance and we have to change that .
i also admire the concept that you have produced .
this is why the response of the conference wa exactly the right one .
they should be aware that they have our solidarity .
any form of political isolation will only play into the hand of lukashenko .
the citizen of belarus should be welcomed into the union .
a policy of agreement and tolerance could not bring about the desired effect .
europe will not tolerate the suppression of freedom by the belarusian dictatorship .
we can provide real assistance when it come to education and visa facilitation .
any restriction imposed must not affect the country 's citizen , however .
we must follow in poland 's footstep and relax the visa regime .
i would like to call for this in the strongest possible term .
lukashenko is leading the country and the opposition is in gaol .
we speak of political prisoner who must be released .
however , there is yet to be a trial .
we do not yet know what the verdict will be .
they all survived because american trade union member sent financial assistance .
such a move would certainly raise attention and many question across the country .
the ihf is the body in charge of such a decision .
i will take great heart from the comment that have been made .
we will now move forward to make sure that we do this .
i also made very direct comment to the foreign minister .
if they do not , then the international community will and must act .
the vote will take place on thursday , 20 january 2011 .
would you like u to take a five-minute break just to relax ?
it is up to you , otherwise we can keep going .
let me say it quite clearly : no unhcr , no agreement .
libya must be persuaded to ratify the geneva convention on refugee .
i am determined to ensure that the close cooperation between our institution continues .
i know that our chief negotiator debriefs you after each negotiation session .
let me give you some information on the latest state of play .
we completed the ninth round of negotiation in mid-november in tripoli .
the next one is scheduled for 24-26 january in brussels .
therefore , the attention and caution libya devotes to this issue is understandable .
a for trade , libya ha limited experience negotiating complex trade agreement .
this is why progress ha been moderate in this field .
one of them is the question of the rome statute .
libya categorically refuse to make an explicit reference to the rome statute .
this is an important point for the european union .
a you know , negotiating directive are a classified document of the council .
the council ha informed the chair of the committee on foreign affair accordingly .
massive illegal immigration in malta risk altering it demographic composition .
lastly , this recommendation call for reflection on the issue of bilateral agreement .
let u make sure the eu doe not commit the same mistake twice .
we must also address the sensitive issue of the death penalty .
gaddafi want more money or else he will let europe turn black .
gaddafi : 'islam must become the religion of europe ' .
gaddafi reject democracy in favour of strict observance of sharia law .
nor should we reward the refugee with refugee status or permanent residence .
incidentally , it is also a disgrace that saudi arabia doe too .
libya 's leader is a master of capriciousness and unreliability .
the eu is now about to conclude a framework agreement with him .
this is , incidentally , what the charter of the european union require .
the italian exception must not become the european rule .
we can not forget the horror that gandufa prison revealed to u .
are these the base on which agreement should be conducted ?
we can not deal with either terrorist or dictator .
it ha already bought greek , spanish and portuguese bond .
the unrest will certainly have an impact on the influx of refugee .
this mean sharing it equally between the member state .
i have visited the camp in libya and seen what go on there .
we had the opportunity to speak with the people in charge .
they are not concerned about human right or about giving refuge to people .
to ignore libya and the maghreb would truly be a very serious mistake .
i am fully aware that certain topic are problematic in relation with libya .
i have absolutely no illusion about the challenge we face .
libya ha shown it strong will to deepen relation with the european union .
i think this debate highlight the dilemma we face .
the vote will take place on thursday , 20 january 2011 .
cost of examining asylum seeker ' application in member state ( debate )
this concern area such a the interpreting service and also legal advice .
there are also hardly any detailed calculation and analysis concerning the new proposal .
victim of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the eu .
if he reappears , he is offered an extended range of procedural option .
the future of this complex undertaking is by no mean clear .
are they talking about human cost , political cost or financial cost ?
these different cost are sometimes linked in any case .
in the second place , some of the existing practice are utterly unacceptable .
above all , we can talk about how we might improve the situation .
mr president , sometimes we are the victim of our own working method .
let u think through what the implication of that might be .
i find that totally unacceptable , especially given the current situation .
by way of conclusion , i would like to clarify one point .
that requires a neat process and proper arrangement for reception .
in this context , please allow me to point out one more aspect .
we are counting on the commitment and expertise of the european parliament .
only a few member state could identify the full cost of asylum procedure .
the commission assessed financial implication on the basis of the available information .
additional investment in the first-instance procedure improve the efficiency of the asylum process .
these saving considerably outweighed the additional legal aid cost .
therefore , the commission doe not intend to prepare another study on cost .
i can think of many reason why the situation is blocked .
it would be unfortunate if this process should cease .
let u continue to hope and work towards this being possible .
i also doubt that there will be le red tape .
unfortunately , that is not a good thing for europe .
we therefore want more information from member state backing up their claim .
asylum seeker ' right to legal aid applies at different level .
these difference demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed .
it deal with the minimum standard applicable to asylum procedure .
therefore , the assessment that we are asking of the commission is necessary .
they vary significantly in their present form from one country to another .
i have a request for you , mr füle .
if overall standard are raised , the consequence will be cost increase .
i am more than happy to discus this point .
several element of the proposal proved , nevertheless , to be difficult indeed .
he stated this in connection with the rom policy .
the hungarian presidency will carry on the work of it belgian predecessor .
the united state attracted 43 % more foreign investment than in 2009 .
it demonstrates the european union facing a competitiveness deficit .
i hope you will clarify this issue on behalf of commissioner almunia .
another issue is the set of rule for divestment .
work criterion for downsizing company are sufficiently clear and fair .
this is a feature we have often seen in the process of privatisation .
i remember it too well in the postal sector .
government propped up their postal provider just before entering the private market .
preventing a problem is better than going the long way of legal redress .
however , the gradual phasing out of these measure ha already started .
some measure have been terminated and others have been maintained under stricter condition .
it then plan to adopt a communication based on the result of this .
good competition policy also contributes to creating growth again in europe .
transport is also a decisive issue when it come to competition .
the railway are required to bear the burden here .
we have a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive for every kilometre travelled .
this is a mandatory levy and ha no upper limit .
we can not allow this because it completely miss the point .
that is why you must establish fair competition in the transport sector too .
a concrete example of this is the baltic state and the gas market .
i therefore congratulate the rapporteur , mr eppink , on his excellent work .
the second sector is that of raw material , particularly food commodity .
a market survey on this issue is absolutely vital .
another point , and not the least important , is tax competition .
under such condition , this therefore constitutes a direct form of aid .
the report set down pointer for the commission 's future policy on competition .
no , we are not going to enter into a discussion on this .
mr dartmouth , you may respond to mr lambert later in the corridor .
you have invented new rule - your own rule - a a chairman .
perhaps you will allow him the opportunity for a brief reply later on .
i would like to continue where mr lambert left off .
there is no denying that we need transparency in the banking system .
this is the work of cartel and big business .
the second aspect of this issue is pharmaceutical authorisation .
i would once again call on you to take intensive action here .
we need to do that in a number of area .
mr president , competition policy is a cornerstone of european legislation .
this is a very bad phenomenon and it go back to party treasury .
we also need new rule for the internet sector .
however , our relationship with the commission is tremendously boring .
in my opinion , this is just a important .
however , lady and gentleman , this is now in the distant past .
in this , however , i request the commission 's cooperation .
coordination is also required in all functional and regulatory area .
this , however , is the responsibility of the commission .
however , the condition of competition must be equal .
hopefully , he will continue to play a progressive role in this area .
i would like to thank mr eppink for his report .
we are concentrating , here , on the work of the european commission .
we have been talking about assistance for the banking sector .
thank you , and i apologise for exceeding my speaking time .
therefore , the commission should be congratulated for it work on the subject .
european competition law is both wide-ranging in scope and highly specialised .
caution ha to be the keyword at a time of such uncertainty .
these saving are due to increased competition via common standard and process .
will what wa done be effective in the long term ?
competition policy should help promote and enforce open standard and interoperability .
this would prevent a technological lock-in being applied by market player .
so the report should say much more about that .
i have one other point in relation to competition .
i make some complaint to the commission on behalf of constituent .
appropriate competition policy is the right tool for achieving this objective .
it is good that we make these annual assessment of competition policy .
such an examination , with the benefit of hindsight , is very instructive .
it is necessary to improve competition in the market for medicine and energy .
i note your call for sector inquiry in a number of market .
the commission 's enforcement of the competition rule is essential to enable this .
a sustainable eu policy for the high north ( debate )
in this report , i also focused on the human dimension .
we engage with the arctic region on many level .
secondly , we pursue solid environmental and maritime policy .
we seek to promote a safer , sustainable arctic .
i believe that it message and approach are timely and appropriate .
that is precisely why our policy must be responsible .
this ha all been expressed well in the report .
therefore , we will be pleased to endorse the report in the vote .
mr president , many thanks to mr gahler for his report .
the issue of making better use of shipping route ha already been discussed .
the logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region .
climate change ha led to this situation in the arctic .
however , this strategy take a diametrically opposite approach .
now it is diplomacy and cooperation that are needed .
an influence which is significantly greater than in other region .
the eu 's environmental footprint there is not light .
i also agree about the position of the indigenous people .
emission trading simply doe not work ; it is harmful .
the thing that the eu touch do not necessarily go ahead .
the danish member spoke here sensibly about the region which are there .
the eu is playing an active role in arctic issue .
thank you very much for your attention and congratulation to the rapporteur .
that is why they need to be listened to .
no one ha the right to rape and plunder that region .
that is why it should be more active and responsible .
it should invest in the region financially and tangibly .
this will also depend on iceland 's possible future membership .
we observe that china is even now building an icebreaker .
this is a virgin area a long way away .
however , there are people living there , people with a culture .
in my opinion , it would be good to draw up a plan ...
a fifth of the world 's undiscovered resource lie in precisely this region .
let me address five specific issue raised in this morning 's discussion .
this area ha been mentioned in the framework programme .
it promotes a cautious approach that we will also apply in the arctic .
madam president , i would also like to thank all the speaker .
i look forward to further debate on the basis of this report .
the vote should not mark the end of this issue .
an eu strategy for the black sea ( debate )
today , our policy in the area can be further developed .
some people would say that the black sea is a small sea .
let me mention just two of the recommendation in the report .
the creation of a separate budget line in the eu budget is vital .
the report and it recommendation are interesting and innovative on the many issue .
since the latest enlargement , the black sea is also an eu sea .
indeed , the danube strategy will require obvious interaction with the black sea .
however , we are aware that each european basin region is different .
a key task is to incorporate a project approach into the new strategy .
these are different matter and this cooperation doe not replace them .
to my mind , there are two main reason for this .
this resolution pursues that objective and is therefore supported by my group .
this is absolutely essential following the disaster in the gulf of mexico .
had georgia been in nato , the consequence could have been disastrous .
turkey ha just 4 % of it landmass within europe .
disappointment could drive turkey into the hand of islamic extremist .
today , this house should offer it wholehearted support for the strategy .
it need to complement the established european neighbourhood policy and the eastern partnership .
stability and security around the black sea have a direct impact on europe .
this will provide effective help in modernising the area .
we need to launch the energy and transport partnership alongside the environment partnership .
so far , we have had various financial instrument and little visibility .
this could also offer a good basis for multilateral cooperation in the region .
i propose we begin this cooperation and act together with others .
however , we note the lack of a structured approach to this region .
at some point , we need to set a time limit .
i think that the european union should not ignore this region .
yesterday , mr barroso reported the result achieved in azerbaijan and turkmenistan .
i also wish to thank rapporteur ungureanu for this compelling and necessary report .
the vote will take place in a few moment .
however , the black sea synergy ha produced limited result .
unresolved conflict have become the sore point in the black sea region .
they can reignite at any time , posing a threat to regional security .
the black sea is also of particular importance to eu energy security .
the european union strategy for the black sea region resembles a yeti .
everyone talk about it , but no one ha seen it .
first , there is the definition of the black sea region .
the conclusion from the last debate on suspending visa with ukraine are missing .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
situation of christian in the context of freedom of religion (
( de ) we would propose making the following insertion in paragraph 105 :
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
we thank the country you represent which did not desert u .
so that such a tragic story is never repeated , we must ...
the commission ha spent an incredible eur 4 million on promoting islam .
these fund could probably have been used for other important purpose .
this resolution is , of course , an expression of that obligation .
we can not stand idly by in the face of such event .
we called for the appointment of a special eu representative on human right .
the situation of christian around the world need action from the european union .
this is what is happening in various part of the world .
( fi ) mr president , this is an historic , excellent resolution .
we need to focus attention on freedom of religion in europe .
people are becoming victim of persecution because of their religion .
this , in turn , is due to a misplaced fear of islam .
these value are a crucial part of our european identity .
( ga ) mr president , i attended the debate here yesterday .
that is a very important point around the world .
we know of the massacre of christian in iraq .
he did not do so , and this is to be regretted .
i would have liked to see more regarding the problem faced by youth .
this is a protest against the lack of freedom of speech in belarus .
he ha turned again to the most shameful feature of his dictatorship .
i strongly condemn the dictatorial practice of president lukashenko 's regime .
we are facing a fierce intensification of repression directed against human right defender .
one example is a clear initiative like the common european patent .
this is an example of how ineffective the eu is .
i believe that public money should have been used to promote growth .
i am pleased that the finn are demonstrating crossparty cooperation on this matter .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the report .
negotiation on an eu-libya framework agreement started in november 2008 .
the economic partnership between europe and libya is already a reality .
libya ha 6 million inhabitant , 2 million of whom are foreigner .
libya is a country which requires a great deal of work .
meanwhile , the common position against cuba is being maintained .
parliament should take immediate action to raise the issue more vigorously .
i therefore voted in favour of the european parliament recommendation to the council .
however , it is anything but a blank cheque .
the eu need to engage with libya across a broad range of issue .
the european union must conclude the framework agreement a soon a possible .
today , however , they are fleeing the region en masse .
christian in iraq and egypt may be feeling abandoned and betrayed .
it ha the instrument to do so , if it want to .
i therefore declare my vote in favour of the resolution .
such act of violence should be condemned in the most absolute of term .
it is the foundation on which to build effective policy .
it is not just fundamentalism that is the threat .
religious freedom concern all religion ; it even concern atheist .
those who deny their own root deserve little respect from anyone else .
everyone ha the right to freedom of religion , conscience and thought .
the premise is that freedom of religion must apply to all religion .
of those killed now because of their religion , 75 % are christian .
approximately 100 million christian every day suffer violence because of their religion .
obviously , something concrete must come from the resolution that we have adopted .
a socialist , we support human right a one of our basic policy .
religious violence is rooted in the dogmatism that is inherent in all religion .
we must therefore protect people against the violence generated by these religion .
i shall vote in favour , out of compassion and conviction .
we hear of the persecution of christian with increasing frequency .
we must not be indifferent to such disregard for human life .
to attack these community is to undermine our most fundamental value .
i am wholeheartedly voting in favour of the joint resolution .
i voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in belarus .
they have been requested to rescind this decision immediately .
therefore , we did not vote in favour of this resolution .
this is why i voted for the adoption of the resolution .
the eastern partnership can play a significant role here .
arrest , search and further conviction continued over the next few day .
this unacceptable attitude towards the opposition should be of great concern to u .
anyone arrested for political reason should be released immediately .
the eu ha not recognised the official poll result .
it is for that reason that i have abstained from voting .
many demonstrator and opposition leader were arrested and could face severe sentence .
the report cover both antitrust policy and state aid control policy .
consumer gain most when competition policy is applied effectively .
furthermore , parliament must be informed regularly of any initiative in this field .
these are essential condition for a successful internal market .
the report ha also been successful in setting out the best way forward .
i have therefore decided to vote in favour of the report .
we have voted on a crucially important document on eu competition policy .
competition is essential for the healthy functioning of the economy .
competition should be looked at worldwide a well a inside the union .
i welcome the call for completion of the single railway market throughout europe .
there is little doubt that a coordinated approach in this area make sense .
however , it should not degenerate into an attack on sovereignty .
for this reason , i have voted against the report .
we want the internal market to be effective , dynamic and innovative .
competition policy is the right tool for achieving these objective .
this is particularly important given the increasing interest in the exploitation of resource .
this region is also a very important route for world maritime transport .
iceland 's accession would also strengthen the eu 's presence in the region .
i would stress the importance of guaranteeing the best condition for scientific research .
the indigenous people have a right to an unpolluted natural environment .
the indigenous people also need special protection and consideration .
it member include three eu member state - sweden , denmark and finland .
both report refer to the 'black sea synergy ' .
i would caution against this belief , certainly with regard to fishery .
the black sea strategy must be based on the uniqueness of the area .
i therefore declare my vote against the abovementioned report .
paragraph 39 of this report recall the aim of diversifying route .
it specifically mention the strategic importance of the nabucco project .
the black sea region is a strategic area for europe .
it is there that they understand the region 's politics best .
discussion on the black sea synergy began in 2007 .
the proposal for the danube strategy wa drawn up in 2006 .
the danube strategy will be finalised in the first half of this year .
the black sea can contribute to the development of the danube .
the danube region contributes to the development of the black sea .
for this reason , i believe that a common approach should be considered .
the issue that could bring an immediate result is energy .
the most important project in this regard is the nabucco pipeline .
it is an inflammatory text , and i shall vote against it .
the strategic importance of the black sea is now well established .
the eu intends to become involved directly and permanently .
turkey , georgia and ukraine have repeatedly expressed their appetite for eu membership .
the commission responded by launching it communication on black sea synergy in 2007 .
it is particularly important that natural gas supply for europe should be secured .
nonetheless , i have voted in favour of the report .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
unfortunately , black sea synergy result have so far been rather limited .
the black sea region is of major strategic importance for the european union .
i supported the report on eu strategy in the black sea region .
the black sea region ha known bilateral conflict for many , many year .

pakistan : murder of the governor of punjab , salmaan taseer
others followed in their condemnation of the blasphemy law , even conservative politician .
we have to support that here in the european parliament .
today , we have adopted a resolution on the matter .
the murder of mr taseer show how delicate a situation we face .
will asia bibi 's fate be the same if she is pardoned ?
we are , indeed , talking about this matter one more time .
there wa a resolution about pakistan a couple of month ago .
salmaan wa a man of charm , charisma and high intelligence .
there are only 3 million christian in pakistan 's population of 160 million .
we are well aware that the persecution of christian exists in many country .
one such common value is the freedom of religion .
it is being violated , however , around the world almost daily .
this assassination underline the growing radicalisation of pakistani society .
jinnah , were he alive today , would be shocked .
they seem to be winning the battle of idea in pakistan .
we therefore really can not remain indifferent to what is happening .
sharia law is now recognised in some tribunal in the uk .
this is the case in pakistan , for example .
that is why we should understand that this is an islamic state .
all these deed in the name of justice were his undoing .
high representative ashton strongly condemned the killing in her statement on 4 january .
ideally , of course , the blasphemy law would be totally repealed .
inciting hatred and violence with impunity should not be allowed .
it is regrettable that this ultimately cost him his life .
the european court of human right did not consider the appeal .
in other word , this case is disposed of .
there are therefore no question mark over our friendly relationship with brazil .
it is not a matter of revenge , but justice must be done .
we have to await the decision that they will make in due course .
so far , it ha been a debate between lusophones and italophones .
if you were in my shoe , how would you do it ?
it doe not , however , reduce the seriousness of battisti 's crime .
raising criminal to the status of political refugee can not be accepted .
there is a bilateral extradition treaty between brazil and italy .
my dear fellow member , would you like to make yourself clear ?
then please speak into the microphone and i will answer you .
that is what you would call a personal accusation .
i am here every thursday afternoon myself , sir !
every thursday afternoon , i am here in plenary !
mr president , may i please have my allotted time ?
you only have to read the european parliament debate to realise that .
this is not how thing are done in the european parliament !
mr president , would it be possible to speak without being interrupted ?
i would very much like them to show the same tolerance towards me .
do you really think it is appropriate to pick fight ?
i have taken a personal interest in this period .
we have had the argument and we have had the counter-arguments .
( we now move to the next speaker . )
in writing . - the rule of law must be upheld .
the rule of law is fundamental to brazilian-eu relation .
our treaty are founded on the principle of human right and fairness .
iran , in particular , the case of nasrin sotoudeh
she is banned from practising law , but let u serve justice .
defending human right is now considered an act against national security .
human right are clearly the achilles heel of the iranian regime .
colleague , you heard the request made by mr schaake .
other colleague have also asked if you could be quiet .
if you have something private to discus , you can do so outside .
the mullah have hanged 65 people so far this year .
eighty-seven people have been hanged in the past four week .
anyone who try to expose this evil is immediately targeted .
well , i for one would sign up to that project today .
this verdict wa reached following a mockery of a trial .
it is good that the european parliament ha taken up this matter .
those last two word should probably be put in inverted comma .
this group would have done well to study today 's plenary .
in addition , we read about the increasing number of death sentence .
the european parliament must react to case of human right violation .
pakistan : murder of the governor of punjab , salmaan taseer (

eu recognition of the rom genocide during world war ii
today the rom are the largest ethnic minority in the european union .
they are also the most oppressed community in europe at present .
unfortunately , not all european are aware of this fact .
only a few eu member state have officially recognised the rom genocide .
today we are speaking up for our rom brother and sister .
at that point my son , józsi , said :
`` i do n't care , my son , ” said i .
i fainted and wa taken out of the crematorium . '
should we not concern ourselves with the future instead ?
if they were alive , many of them would be eu citizen today .
'but this is still the past , ' one could say .
the council and it hungarian presidency would like to contribute to this .
let u all fight together the ghost of the past .
too many rom are still victim of racism , discrimination and social exclusion .
this wa the first-ever policy document dedicated specifically to rom .
however , there were also other victim of the national socialist atrocity .
they are still discriminated against and prejudice still exist .
other study mention more than a million rom murdered during those year .
however , we can not just stop at this .
mr president , i speak here this afternoon with deep feeling .
to the horror of war have been added neglect , indifference and silence .
the recognition of the rom genocide is therefore a genuine act of remembrance .
let u make the rom people european citizen in their own right .
he wrote : 'i have found my parent again .
after much soul-searching i have reached the point where i can face death .
thank you once again for everything that you have done for me .
the joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over .
we need the whole truth about this chapter of history .
we must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people .
raising awareness of these event is a priority for current and future generation .
the rom are part of the future of romania , a european romania .
the tragedy of the holocaust is now part of our collective memory .
the best form of commemoration is to look to the future .
we need a community which will be fully integrated into modern society .
preparation for the european council meeting ( 4 february 2011 ) ( debate )
energy security is a priority for all of u .
this requires a greater degree of integration and interconnection of the energy market .
the first element is therefore an integrated and interconnected energy market .
the establishment of a complete internal energy market is a necessity .
to this end , the european council must decide on several important step .
first of all , it must implement legislation on the internal energy market .
we also still have regulatory task ahead of u .
we must , for example , simplify authorisation procedure for building new infrastructure .
all this must be funded primarily by the private sector .
furthermore , appropriate cost sharing principle must be laid down for cross-border investment .
foreign relation are also of exceptional importance in energy policy .
let u move on to the topic of innovation .
innovation could also help resolve the dilemma between budgetary rigour and pro-growth policy .
from where can we obtain funding for growth before it becomes self-sustaining ?
not from credit , since that is not something we want .
energy and innovation : investment pointing towards the future .
this is an important point to make in the current context .
so this week 's european council should identify clear , concrete deliverable .
the discussion and outcome should be a operational and productive a possible .
it could also create two million job by 2020 .
we also need to focus on the external dimension of european energy policy .
fiscal consideration and public support for innovation are not irreconcilable policy .
our competitor know this , they are already betting on innovation .
and a well a maintaining spending , we need to spend better .
so this month 's european council will discus energy and innovation .
the commission will be particularly attentive to these issue .
they were the one that set themselves this objective .
finally , having more europe in the field of energy mean investing more .
we expect ambitious decision from the european council in order to achieve this .
i will therefore limit myself to two essential element .
disconnecting people from the energy supply is a question of social injustice .
the president of the commission is right about one thing , however .
that is a basic condition for maintaining the balance of the european institution .
i am disturbed by the absence of europe in a historic process .
mr van rompuy make his statement - that is also excellent .
we must not waste the opportunity that we have here .
i have to say that the commission 's letter wa excellent .
it is not compatible with the audiovisual medium service directive .
that ha been stated very elegantly by mr kroes herself .
quite frankly , i find it both disappointing and embarrassing .
the world outside of europe is facing the energy challenge head on .
the u is investing huge amount of money in green technology .
( the president briefly intervened on a procedural matter )
you do not even dare to discus a binding energy efficiency target .
china is investing heavily in research and new technology .
ten year ago they had zero per cent of the world market .
ten year ago they had zero per cent of the wind market .
that is where we are compared to china and the u .
what is keeping the fidesz government from doing so ?
i wa in hungary quite often between 2002 and 2010 .
i also saw demonstration by your uniformed jobbik party in budapest .
i will not tell you what these demonstration reminded me of .
a a german i will not go into that here .
this summit is actually supposed to be an energy summit .
perhaps we have actually been too patient where economic governance is concerned .
germany now seems to be following the schäuble course .
we need more than a minor amendment to the stability instrument .
we want the immediate neighbourhood of the eu to be stable and democratic .
what we need in this council is an energy revolution .
they say they have already promised to supply five other party with gas .
we face the most horrifying scenario of losing the suez canal .
so , a for egypt , for all of u : orderly transition .
it can not be evaluated according to such a criterion .
it ha not been following the principle of constantly making new demand .
you spoke about poverty that can arise a a result of energy price .
moreover , the state will not be able to bear this cost alone .
there are also politician who make sound preparation and implement initiative .
first , let u do what we have already committed ourselves to .
we are fairly good , but not good enough .
take action ; do something - here and now .
ensure that we have binding energy efficiency target that are actually complied with .
give consumer and citizen strong and clear right in relation to energy company .
ensure that the energy market is both transparent and capable of being monitored .
that is not good economics , especially in a time of crisis .
so much for how important they think it is to listen to u .
this is a considerable victory and renewables will continue .
that is the number one energy of the future .
we ought to discus this with the council a well .
undoubtedly , energy security can not be discussed without including innovation .
energy is at the heart of the european social pact for prosperity .
fifty per cent of our energy supply come from outside the union .
this brings me on to the subject of research and innovation .
eur 53 billion have been earmarked for the period 2007-2013 .
relation with industrial policy are disappointing , and we must ass them .
finally , how are we to structure our european space ?
this is the europe of result which our fellow citizen of europe expect .
this is another item that the council ought not to ignore .
however , we should be pragmatic a well a ambitious .
a great tectonic change is taking place before our eye .
the greek communist party express it solidarity with the people protesting in egypt .
it call on the people to express their real support and solidarity .
i believe that we do not have time to waste .
however , the council is engaging in the wrong debate .
our objective should be to switch entirely to renewable energy by 2050 .
a coherent , community approach is required for both production and efficiency .
new transport route can be created in this region .
the danube strategy can also help develop new gas or oil supply route .
we can not discus a common policy without having a common energy network .
nor can it ignore the financial and economic crisis .
these measure require great sacrifice from family and business .
a for the eu , is it doing what it should ?
in other word , we are facing global problem requiring a global response .
that is also what the public expects from the upcoming european council .
we now have to move forward and make progress .
business and household need to make decision according to market condition .
we must also create an environment which will encourage investment in infrastructure .
secondly , regarding energy , we need energy efficiency .
we have a lot of programme in order to achieve that .
that is one way of using energy source efficiently .
i can not see any determination , sincerity or dynamism .
we urgently need more courage to have more europe .
they require the next step to be taken towards integration .
the european union must make use of all potential energy source .
we did miss something , however , which nobody ha noticed .
the hungarian-born nobel laureate györgy oláh ha discovered a methanol economy .
well i am afraid i am stuck for an answer .
if you would allow me one final thought , mr president .
i am convinced that the case could be closed within a few week .
any further malicious and unfounded political attack will be redundant .
this european council on energy really is very important .
the commission is therefore pushing very hard to have very clear target .
i listened very carefully to our meps from the baltic country .
i really believe that we are leader where environmental policy are concerned .
we all know that the cleanest energy is safe energy .
we have to analyse the real cause of our lack of ambitious progress .
the economy will , of course , be discussed a well .
of course , please encourage u to do more in this field .
'the modification of the legislation could be considered ' .
the commission yesterday said it wa pleased that the answer had arrived .
this council is adopting energy and innovation a subject for debate .
there will therefore be no difference in this strategic area of vital importance .
the area of energy and innovation are fundamental to growth and employment .
unfortunately , some of the leader of our country do not understand this .
we can not afford a two-speed europe in the field of energy .
there are currently 27 energy market operating in the eu .
transparency and traceability in the work are necessary prerequisite .
europe should integrate it force in this area too .
situation in the mediterranean , in particular in tunisia and egypt ( debate )
i am going to begin by talking about tunisia .
i plan to travel to tunisia the week after next .
finally , the foreign minister described the atmosphere a an atmosphere of reconciliation .
we are concerned that live ammunition may also have been used .
hundred of thousand have gathered in each rally across the country .
the time ha come for orderly transition and a peaceful and far-reaching transformation .
it is important that civil society play a crucial role in that dialogue .
why , baroness ashton , ha europe reacted so feebly ?
in point of fact , we have hardly reacted at all .
that wa the only decent response to be heard at european level .
i believe that europe ha made two mistake in recent day .
well , let me tell you that i am not afraid .
quite the contrary , they are revolution for freedom .
mr president , baroness ashton , you are appealing for calm .
so , do not appeal for everyone to be calm .
the question is : can you not recall what happened in iran ?
do you not agree that we have to secure an orderly transition here ?
that is precisely the lesson we learnt from iran , mr tzavela .
this is a popular revolt because the people are subjected to abject poverty .
you may have some explaining to do later on .
a mr cohn-bendit rightly said , there are indeed many last-minute resistance fighter .
the tunisian people acted alone to free itself from a dictatorial regime .
today , the violence happening in egypt also show that thing are difficult .
the european union ha lost a great deal of credibility in these country .
yes , finally , we must support the democrat and condemn all dictatorship .
there are certainly lesson to be learnt from iran .
people expect change and they expect aid without string .
the ea representative there said that it wa spent on reform .
i have been told this many time within the european union .
president mubarak ha to leave , that ha to be made clear .
i did not say 'we have failed to accept political islam ' !
there is a difference between terrorist , fundamentalist , and some muslim brother .
let u not throw the baby out with the bath water .
i believe that we need to review our own work in this region .
the situation is in constant flux and is hard to predict .
interestingly enough , both are claiming the credit for this arab popular uprising .
the european union should not turn a blind eye to this threat .
people are rising up against dictatorial despot and that is a good thing .
obviously , we from europe should support the democratic process .
let u therefore be prudent in our choice of partner .
we express our solidarity with the peaceful muslim in the arab world .
however , we should nevertheless try to do so .
furthermore , part of our neighbourhood strategy wa based on there being stability .
we therefore need to speak and express our opinion clearly .
therefore , baroness ashton , we must express our opinion loud and clear .
that is why parliament should continue to provide it unanimous support .
however , there are also risk that we must face up to .
( nl ) mr president , baroness ashton , stop being so naïve .
mr guy verhofstadt , stop being naïve , a well .
baroness ashton , you have not said a single word about that .
democracy doe not just pop up in an unfertile field .
( nl ) mr president , i can only agree with mr deva .
the second subject i want to mention concern u , the european union .
to do this , we need to retune europe 's political antenna .
mr blair also warns against a rush to election in egypt .
what do you think about the statement of tony blair ?
under magna carta , the english have the right of lawful rebellion .
what is happening in egypt ha come a a surprise to u all .
in recent year , they have hardly had any opportunity to structure themselves .
in the case of tunisia , however , we still have time .
it is essential that this decision is taken with a degree of urgency .
the need for a strong , proactive europe is more urgent than ever .
their right and the eu 's credibility are tied .
the situation in egypt is similar , even though thing are moving fast .
go to cairo before the council of foreign minister .
speak with the government representative and with the opposition there .
it is a revolution against the dictatorship and for freedom .
i do believe that europe can dictate the setup in these country .
madam president , this moment ha been a long time coming .
well , that is right , but it is not enough .
high representative , this is not a time for limp wrist .
in my opinion , there are two thing that need to be done .
secondly , we must ask ourselves where we went wrong .
where wa the mediterranean union in all of this ?
is europe ever going to stop reacting and decide to take action instead ?
the international consequence of such a turn of event should be considered .
now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the street .
the union 's visibility ha been in no way comparable .
do we want to be a major global player ?
no dictatorship , no authoritarian regime is stable in itself .
many people are afraid to mention them by name .
to my mind , saudi arabia is a possible candidate , for example .
this situation requires political leadership by the high representative .
however , the 27 do not have differing interest .
finally , i agree with baroness ashton , our high representative .
these are not value that we are imposing from europe .
the moment of truth is also approaching for the european institution .
it should provide effective support for the pro-pluralist political power .
it is already time for mubarak to go ; his time ha passed .
could you confirm whether you agree or disagree with mr blair ?
they are a symbol of hope for all those who defend freedom .
it must implement a strong strategy towards these country .
unfortunately , we are among the last to adopt a common position .
why did we establish the mediterranean union during the french presidency ?
we do not want intolerant and militant islamist to get into power .
there is a great deal of work here for you , baroness ashton .
europe need to revise it current policy on authoritarian regime and dictatorship .
we were the first to make statement on both tunisia and egypt .
neither do i accept that we were slow to act .
i do not accept that we have not done enough .
i do accept that there is more that we can do .
did you give me all the tool i need with the lisbon treaty ?
did you give me all the resource i need ?
i am not somebody who can go out and give my personal view .
when i speak to him i speak on behalf of europe .
we must not lose sight of that in anything else that we do .
i have been saying it for a long time .
it brought about transformation that will last for generation .
that is what we are in the business of .
we are not in the business of knee-jerk reaction and response .
i am of course engaged in what is happening in iran .
i certainly have not forgotten the middle east peace process .
i have not forgotten any of the other issue .
and i am not responsible for what tony blair say .
next week i go to the security council , on your behalf too .
however , at present these aim are far from having been achieved .
support for authoritarian regime , a history show , doe not pay .
may their hope be fulfilled quickly and without bloodshed .
the same happened 20 year ago when the soviet union collapsed .
only genuine democracy can provide for a long-term stability .
expert believe that the riot in tunisia have caused a domino effect .
libya , algeria , jordan , syria and morocco have also been mentioned .
the event in tunisia and egypt proved that autocracy is not a solution .
nevertheless , the same event do not guarantee a democratic outcome .
there is hope and there is danger in the ongoing event in egypt .
tunisia is one of malta 's closest north african neighbour .
also i am hopeful that it domestic situation will improve .
referendum on the future status of southern sudan ( debate )
we also provided technical expertise and financial support to the sudanese referendum authority .
we will continue to engage with both khartoum and juba .
but historic moment are transient - they do not last forever .
the two state have a lot of issue to resolve .
the question that most urgently need to be resolved is that of border .
a solution must be found in order to prevent conflict emerging .
then there is the question of the so-called returnees .
will the government encourage political , ethnic , cultural and religious diversity ?
it currently face a number of challenge , a outlined by baroness ashton .
this region ha the potential to destabilise the whole country .
they will probably now have to be reintegrated in the southern economy .
lastly , there is the problem of the international criminal court .
this wa astounding , representing reconciliation and a new era .
so i fear that there are lot of problem to be resolved .
the comprehensive peace agreement signed in 2005 put an end to that war .
the new state doe not yet have a formal border with the north .
thousand of people are still moving from the north to the south .
essentially , this new state will have to be created from scratch .
so for the un security council , the rule will change .
after all , southern sudan is one of the poorest country in africa .
that is a recipe for disaster and even a recipe for armed conflict .
europe must establish a presence there and must stay there .
i very much hope that that will be the case .
southern sudan should now be the eu 's number one humanitarian development priority .
another war would have unimaginable consequence for africa a a whole .
( applause for dr nazario and the southern sudanese delegation )
in any case , the south ha huge challenge ahead .
however , expert believe that this can not be resolved by military mean .
the necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement .
now , that process certainly requires a reliable police force .
that is simply what the international community is called on to do .
i think that we need a swift but very pragmatic solution here .
this is clear testimony to how determined the people are to achieve self-determination .
( nl ) mr president , these are apocalyptic time .
from mauretania to oman , people are in flux .
all over the world , thousand are dying in natural disaster .
that is a cause for great thanksgiving and joy .
i warmly congratulate my southern sudanese friend present here today on this .
may it be a country where mercy and faith meet together .
may it be a nation where peace and justice are intertwined .
make this country a priority of your foreign policy .
i am looking forward to a specific response from you to my request .
currently 80 % of southerner have no access to toilet facility .
one in ten child die before their first birthday .
every year sudan export billion of dollar of oil .
it will be an indication that they have arrived at statehood .
i think it is something we should encourage sooner rather than later .
i would therefore like to make a very simple point to the commissioner .
there are two or three thing that we need to do .
every day count now until the declaration of independence .
nearby , the people of somaliland do not have that opportunity .
prediction of event in sudan are nothing but crystal-ball gazing .
let u hope that the european union give it full support .
for me and the greek communist party , the answer is very simple .
southern sudan had the good fortune to have oil .
in july , the world 's 193rd state wa officially founded .
however , the split alone will not create stability in the country .
we wish the sudanese people the very best of luck .
it must be remembered that there are nine country bordering on sudan .
that is why what ha happened with the referendum is so important .
lady and gentleman , several of you have spoken of darfur .
that is why we expect all party to embark on this peace process .
the commission spoke about this issue at length in it communication this morning .
very briefly , i would just like to make three further comment .
these are the answer i wanted to give on behalf of baroness ashton .
thus , both side profit from the chinese model .
the problem of illegal migration to europe must not be disregarded either .
where , then , doe the council stand in this scenario ?
parliament and the council agreed to this starting procedure when adopting the regulation .
i hope that the chairperson will now be able to start their work .
we wanted them to be fully operational from 1 january .
to achieve this , they need the full support of your institution .
it is a debate on the future of financial regulation in europe .
in any event , today parliament need a concrete answer .
it deal with problem of human and financial resource .
we agree with virtually everything the commissioner said in plenary this evening .
madam president , lady and gentleman , why are we here ?
that wa not part of the council 's programme .
it wa not part of the member state ' programme .
where there is european supervision , national momentum come to a standstill .
that surprise and annoys u , and it must call u into action .
we still have another opportunity with regard to the executive director .
you can take on board the objection of this house .
i hope that note is taken of this in the future .
there is no guarantee that these authority will do anything better .
i encourage you all to vote against these or any other candidate .
the second point is that of the selection procedure .
it is what it is and it doubtless ha it shortcoming .
i personally brought in the rendez-vous clause to improve it .
i have no reason to question the motif of the candidate chosen .
if i may , i will now continue in hungarian .
the proposal is currently being examined by the preparatory body of the council .
the commission negotiated this agreement on behalf of the european union .
my answer is very clear : it could not .
doe that mean that all 's well that end well ?
i will make the following comment on this issue .
first , the budget for the banana sector ha been increased considerably .
mr president , we all know the meaning of 'banana republic ' .
in these country , the same company continue to produce banana .
these are very poor country that need our help .
once again , small producer will be the one who suffer .
madam president , in my opinion , these agreement are not positive .
madam president , i want to concentrate on fair trade banana .
the world economic forum in davos seems to have provided some impetus .
the g20 want to conclude the world trade organisation negotiation before 2012 .
madam president , a few week ago we were going banana about bee .
we all recognise not only their importance but also their inevitability .
the rapporteur herself admits that the agreement threatens their future existence .
mr mato adrover and mr teixeira , i can show you the figure .
so , i think i have covered the major point .
still , please allow me to mention some myself .
many have expressed concern over what will happen to acp country .
there are many thing that must be done going forward , therefore .
unfortunately , we are unable to savour fully this success .
i will be voting in favour of the agreement .
we must therefore take care that this new competition is fair .
first , health doe not have a price but it ha a cost .
that being the case , it is important to spread the cost broadly .
to be specific , i am talking here about the public-private partnership model .
the alternative would be to protect only well-off population .
the fact is that we still do not have these important data available .
this alternative is therefore already in place , and it work .
from this point of view , then , this possibility could be examined .
however , there are concern about the increasing number of resistant bacteria .
this directly result in a deteriorating economic and social situation in these country .
this justifies the growing concern globally of public health organisation .
tuberculosis constitutes a flagrant example of the inequality that riddle our world .
this is the result of nation-destroying liberal thinking , among other thing .
in other word , it is promoting investment in health .
over 95 % of case occur in developing country .
every second , the tubercle bacillus claim another victim .
access to effective treatment is limited in many country .
we need comprehensive programme aimed both at preventing and treating tuberculosis .
an imbalance persists between the industrialised and developing country .
now to come back to my basic subject of waste .
we are not protesting against justice , but against politically imposed abuse .
it is already february 2011 and the report ha still not been published .
it conclusion indicate that romania meet all the schengen acquis requirement .
meps can not vote without being familiar with the report ' content .
however , the council is delaying making a decision without good reason .
together we must defend our right , our freedom and our democracy .
casino-type investment from many country flooded into irish bank .
there were some who raised their voice in connection with the medium law .
st valentine himself is reputed to have been a sufferer from epilepsy .
on 14 february we must raise awareness of epilepsy .
basque and catalan are entitled to autonomy while the székely are not .
although romania ha a democratic constitution , it article are often blatantly flouted .
i urge and await an official position from mr buzek .
dictatorial regime can not stand firm for long anywhere in the world .
waste crisis in campania ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
fourthly , transparent criterion have been introduced for allocating fund .
all of these advance easily meet the expectation of the acp country .
parliament and the committee on development prove this every day in their work .
this issue also arises in the case of human right dialogue .
in foreign policy , however , this is seen a highly contentious .
this is another reason why this instrument is especially important .
particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprise .
all the matter of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary .
so far , so good - or so it would seem .
we want to do what we see a our duty to our electorate .
otherwise the commission is unable to implement the relevant budget .
thank you for your attention and i am looking forward to the debate .
parliament decided to react quickly , and that is crucial .
we are therefore sending a strong political message to the acp country .
yet we are also sending a message to the council .
the ball is now in the council 's court .
the european union made a commitment to the acp country .
the council should therefore shoulder it responsibility , a parliament ha done .
( fr ) thank you for your question , lord dartmouth .
transparency of european decision must be at the heart of our work .
this is the very spirit of the treaty and the essence of history .
so far the eu instrument have not really been adapted .
i should like to endorse what mr brandtner said .
( pt ) madam president , out with mubarak , now !
hence the insistence of this parliament on the delegated act procedure .
i want to thank the commission for the structured cooperation we have .
let u make sure that this cooperation continues in the future .
madam president , answering that question in 30 second is a big challenge .
this is therefore about strategic choice , about the content of policy .
there is not enough bread and jam for all of them .
nowadays , developing country are strategic partner for the european union .
it is essential for the european union to provide help .
we are demanding nothing more and nothing le than that .
from my point of view , the taxpayer finance a budget .
a budget is an instrument for showing solidarity with the least well off .
it is not true that parliament and the concept are not understood .
project have only had to be discontinued in a few individual case .
on the contrary , we need much clearer financial support .
my apology - i got held up in traffic .
the good news is that it used to be 34 000 .
i can assure this house that we have really tried very hard .
on these issue , there ha been no rapprochement .
they supplement the basic regulation and are of general application .
the criterion mentioned in article 290 are compulsory if they are fulfilled .
the council and parliament must have a veto right .
all amendment concerning delegated act from first reading should be reinstated .
we will not be divided or have our role a a legislature ignored .
twenty-two thousand child do not need to die each day , every day .
we demand to have our say on how this issue is addressed .
i wa the rapporteur on the development and cooperation instrument .
perhaps i can give one more example with regard to the content .
i hope that the new regulation will be future-proof .
the issue of electronic waste is not about implementing exaggerated environmental standard .
what use are advanced technology if we no longer have any raw material ?
every country is doing what it want and using it own definition .
we are right to define the collection target more clearly .
we are right to put a stop to illegal export .
the example i can give would make your hair stand on end .
this is why we want a more dedicated collection system .
we must also stop illegal shipment and change the scope of the directive .
the system must be brought up-to-date and made more attractive .
i would like to start with a question for mr potočnik .
we need the member state to implement the regulation properly .
it is clear that everyone must take on their share of the responsibility .
in other word , parliament want clear and very specific target .
recycling , re-use and ultimate disposal are not cheap and not free .
let u not be over-prescriptive in directing how member state get there .
this is an area that ha been sadly neglected .
the stricter export regulation for electric and electronic waste are important .
some nanomaterials come with clear instruction stating that they are damaging to health .
last week , commissioner , you launched your resource efficiency strategy .
unfortunately , in europe , today it is the exception .
this also give u a chance to finish some uncompleted business .
but the printer company found a way around that .
i look for the support of colleague for those amendment .
madam president , i too enjoy my joust with mr davy .
perhaps i do not recognise you because you have a new haircut .
it say nothing at all about taxpayer having to fund the system .
in fact , this is the responsibility of the producer .
i would like to hear your response to these two point .
madam president , first of all i will repeat what i just said .
we all know where the cost end up - where it always doe .
you never tell people that you are going to put up tax .
the electorate of my country , great britain , can not remove commissioner .
empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation .
our citizen must become actor and not spectator in european environmental policy .
there are other aspect a well , in addition to this impact assessment .
( hu ) madam president , my apology for hesitating .
i would like to thank mr florenz for his excellent professional work .
it is not a question of the cost of dealing with this .
we must put a stop to the export of waste to poor country .
by the way , the recast proposal certainly facilitates implementation .
it is of fundamental importance that we have ambitious target .
many of you mentioned that this is the fastest-growing waste stream .
we published 14 day ago the so-called waste report .
i wa struck by what i learned and saw there .
i held in my hand 20 kilo of gold produced from mobile phone .
many of you also mentioned better reporting and better sorting .
you must continue to be tough with the council .
it is therefore highly necessary to update the directive covering this area .
unchecked shipment usually end up in ghana , nigeria , india or pakistan .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:10 and resumed at 11:30 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
request for waiver of the immunity of mr tamás deutsch (
closure of the account of the european police college for the financial year 2008
appointment of the chairperson of the european supervisory authority ( european banking authority )
( applause and cry of 'hear , hear ' from the efd group )
parliament 's message ha reached the presidency and found open door .
i kindly invite you all to vote in support of the candidate .
at the end of this process , i personally met the people pre-selected .
we know that the market move at a much faster pace than democracy .
there were four area in which we sought assurance .
i do not understand it , but there it is .
author . - mr president , i know this is the last vote .
i am not going to take up much of your time .
i have read the name of the signatory of the amendment .
( it ) mr president , that demonstrates that this resolution is political .
it is even shown in the way people have addressed mr mazzoni .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
the programme is aimed at natural and legal person .
i have been asking to speak for about ten minute .
i should therefore like it put on record how important this initiative is .
i voted in favour of the amended version of this important directive .
the huge growth in electronic waste is the most visible example of this .
this can not but have an effect on the natural environment .
the proposal here are certainly timely in that regard .
also , the point made about the internal market is very important .
we like speaking about it , but it is far from complete .
those little cairn are a visible monument to the law of unintended consequence .
a directive intended to encourage recycling ha ended up encouraging fly-tipping .
a a consequence it ha vitiated the traditional notion of property right .
there is no residual obligation on you to recycle .
sometimes they will even pay you a fee for doing it .
i wa reduced to suggesting that she give it to her mother-in-law .
we are seeing the wind of change sweeping through the middle east .
any upsurge in the flow of illegal migrant must be decisively countered .
i respect the principle of non-interference too much for that .
it is too easy to criticise these people after they have fallen .
but , anyway , he will not come now - mercifully .
it wa not expected that thing would be put right until 2014 .
moreover , we are calling the very existence of cepol into question .
in fact , that would represent a huge saving for the taxpayer .
we should save the taxpayer some money and scrap it .
so why did we so overwhelmingly vote to appoint these nominee ?
then we ourselves voted on the supervisory authority chair .
by voting against , we were actually voting in favour .
our aim wa not to discredit or run down the region .
we were also not intending to fight any domestic political battle .
the european union 's fair offer to campania is a follows .
indeed , the case involving tamás deutsch demonstrates it direct benefit .
accordingly , the accuser brought the criminal proceeding against tamás deutsch .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
development and economic growth currently underpin the proper functioning of a country .
this is why we can not support this measure .
development cooperation represents a very important part of eu external relation .
this instrument can be used in way that will benefit population .
the saharov prize , for example , is evidence of this .
this motion is primarily about empowering the commission to adopt delegated act .
for this reason , i voted in favour of this report .
development cooperation represents a very important part of eu external relation .
development and economic growth currently underpin the proper functioning of a country .
the union 's development policy aim to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty .
for each one of them there are justification that sound credible .
however , taken together they are all aimed at the same thing .
and we know by now who is paying for all of this .
the hard-pressed taxpayer and obviously and a usual the british taxpayer - disproportionately .
the cost of all this , despite our best effort , is unknown .
that is why we did not support either proposal and abstained .
cooperation with industrialised country is of enormous importance for the eu economy .
the proposed change were introduced with this in mind .
it is essential that the commission provide an impact assessment on this agreement .
this is important support and we understand that the adaptation can take time .
we believe that the eu 's agricultural aid should be phased out .
that is what the majority of this parliament seems to ignore .
we must demand reciprocity and access to foreign market for our own product .
amendment 11 draw attention to human right concern in columbia and honduras .
once again , small producer will be the one who suffer .
in this respect , i express my objection and abstain from this vote .
the free trade agreement concluded in this context are ill-considered in my view .
of the total production , only 20 % is destined for international trade .
it establishes an artificial level playing field between banana-exporting country .
it doe not say a word about their environmental crime .
this agreement is therefore an illusion and part of a harmful policy .
for these reason , i voted against this report .
only 20 % of global production is traded internationally .
nevertheless , only 20 % of production is traded internationally .
therefore i welcome the end of this trade war .
i supported this initiative knowingly , without a smile on my face .
in the eu alone 5.4 million tonne of banana were sold in 2008 .
however , the eu is faced by a problem .
five multinational corporation control 80 % of the international banana trade .
i appeal to consumer to actively contribute to the success of such collection .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
however , i find i have to point out a few critical flaw .
apart from that , some very important point also emerge .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting on the report .
flow of waste electrical and electronic equipment are increasing in the european union .
in any case , the objective is more recycling and greater re-use .
therefore , we voted in favour of this report .
electrical and electronic waste are recycled in completely different way .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
the quantity of waste electrical and electronic equipment is steadily increasing each year .
today , only a third of this waste is collected and treated properly .
the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment is constantly increasing .
in theory , therefore , i would have wanted to support this approach .
for that reason i decided to vote against the proposal .
smes would have massive problem to contend with when implementing these regulation .
this fact entail several other matter which require an efficient solution .
the new eu member state will need to make a particular effort .
sadly , we do not have a spare planet .
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on achieving this important goal .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the entire sector from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting on the report .
this is good economic sense being used to protect the environment .
i believe this is an excellent way of promoting this clean technology .
however , the subject of photovoltaic module remains a problem .
there is no understandable reason for excluding the solar industry from the regulation .
we have a wide range of legislation governing waste stream .
solar cell may contain toxic substance which can be reused .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting on the report .
the commission also did not want to introduce any change .
for this reason , i have not voted in favour of this report .
we must not allow this to happen , in particular to smes .
excluding the smallest company which have very small premise is not enough .
the european parliament 's resolution sends a powerful signal in this respect .
i therefore welcome the initiative to set up a commission of inquiry .
the tunisian people need support in developing properly working state institution .
respect for human right should form the basis for political dialogue .
the people of tunisia have opened a new page .
the european union must now meet the legitimate expectation of the tunisian people .
europe must prioritise it relation with those entity that respect fundamental freedom .
indeed , the european union ha a great duty in this regard .
i know that nothing will ever be the same again .
it ha done so because , allegedly , such partner do not exist .
it would appear that that is not strictly true .
we are witness of the enforced departure of authoritarian ruler .
we need a systematic strengthening of recognition of the value which we hold .
we have a new external action service , which should facilitate this work .
in writing . - i voted for the resolution on tunisia .
i support the position adopted in the motion for a resolution on tunisia .
i fully support tunisia 's democratic transition and development process .
i fully endorse the appeal made by the european union .
it is still not clear where the change of government will lead .
stability in the area is a basic and permanent european ambition .
this one and only approach ha now been reduced to dust .
the day of the dictatorial and technocratic east are over .
it now remains to create a different kind of east .
therefore , the sole criterion for access must be need .
only this will allow u to reduce the prevalence of this disease .
this is why i endorsed the motion for a resolution .
the tbvi is a practical way of implementing the eu 2020 strategy .
that hospital is not functioning now since there is no medical staff !
around one third of the world 's population is infected .
it is clear that we are far from eradicating tuberculosis .
for this reason , i have abstained from voting .
these worthy goal were also the reason why i voted in favour .
research and funding in this area should therefore be increased .
human solidarity must reach out beyond the border of country and continent .
if we cease to feel this solidarity , we cease to be human .
given the irregularity observed , cepol should be closed down .
there are case of inappropriate use of fund which border on financial crime .
i consider this resolution to be very timely and useful .
the european police college ( cepol ) wa established in 2000 .
cepol help national body to work together to prevent and combat crime .
in addition , it work closely with police service from third country .
however , now it is important to look to the future .
in fact it add another level of bureaucracy to existing supervision .
there will be confusion about who is responsible for what .
it is this that give rise to the european banking authority .
in addition , financial supervisory authority only represent part of the overall solution .
in fact it add another level of bureaucracy to existing supervision .
there will be confusion about who is responsible for what .
i wish him the greatest happiness in carrying out his duty .
in fact it add another level of bureaucracy to existing supervision .
there will be confusion about who is responsible for what .
therefore , it is important that this agency start to operate soon .
the financial supervisory authority may be more useful than many other eu institution .
with the current division of responsibility , this will be difficult .
the three new financial supervisory authority only represent part of the overall solution .
in addition , the member state need to change their attitude .
for this reason , the green voted to reject his candidature .
the health and environmental situation in that region is already very alarming .
i am truly appalled at the behaviour of member of the italian left .
the image of naples swamped by rubbish ha spread around the world .
everyone , therefore , know the extent of the problem .
in writing . - i abstained on the resolution .
it ha blighted the daily life of many italian .
such plant have already begun operating in utena , marijampoland panevėžys .
this is a good example , but we need more .

we admire their courage , determination and aspiration for democracy .
this stance ha already brought significant change , which we fully support .
we call for the restoration of full freedom of speech .
let u work towards this objective together a a true community .
in the european union , we also share this obligation and this responsibility .
finally , shocking figure are reaching u from iran .
particularly alarming are the death sentence being handed down to political dissident .

text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
the debate wa requested last week only because mr putin wa coming .
i should now like to receive some information concerning what we discussed .
lady and gentleman , there is one more request concerning tuesday .
the reason for this request will be given by mr mauro .
after all , we have to deal with an enormous influx of people .
we now have to establish a title for this debate .
mr president , i will attempt to formulate this very precisely once again .
the european commission also agreed to help u in this regard .
on the first point , i have the following to say .
in some case , they are merely internet portal .
one issue here is the language that is provided .
it is not enough to offer the local language and perhaps english .
that is what i demand of the member state in this context .
mr president , thank you for your welcoming remark .
mr gebhardt spoke of lengthy discussion here in parliament .
discussion took place before that ; they took place outside parliament , too .
however , service are a key source of growth and employment .
we shall perhaps discus this later on with regard to the patent .
many state have still not transposed it fully or correctly .
that is precisely the reason for this own-initiative report .
secondly , the report highlight the fundamental element of the directive 's transposition .
the second aspect concern the scope of the directive .
developing a single market for service is very important for creating new job .
additional support must be given to small and medium-sized enterprise .
in some case , many procedure are still not available in electronic form .
unfortunately , a reading of the report on mutual evaluation confirms these fear .
this report ha therefore come at a very opportune time .
the verts/ale group will therefore vote against this report .
it is doing so on account of two key point .
we also called for an assessment of the cost impact for public authority .
my final point is in the form of a question to commissioner barnier .
that is what the point of single contact are all about .
we regret the absence of this in the report .
unfortunately , therefore , the gue/ngl group can not support this report .
she said that the transposition of the directive ha to be correct .
i agree , but it also ha to be timely .
unfortunately , however , these thousand of change are clearly not enough .
you can count on receiving support from our imco committee .
furthermore , service of general interest are being destroyed or privatised everywhere .
mr president , the service directive ha been consistently opposed by my party .
this is just more unreality , more bureaucracy and more dismay .
the campaign should be aimed at all those involved , including public body .
what interest me especially is how smaller enterprise have fared .
i would like to have much more precise information on this .
the problem is that protectionism still persists in many member state .
perhaps this will result in some kind of desirable outcome in the future .
there are still some challenge to be overcome , however .
in my view , the language of the neighbouring country should be used .
a of now , these campaign have yet to be organised .
hopefully , that will change with the new government .
particularly where smes are concerned , there is great potential .
the first thing is certainly to transpose the directive into law .
it ha been far too easy up to now .
if we are to have progress , this ha to be done .
if each sme had one more employee , unemployment would cease in europe .
this is a great opportunity , a mr harbour and others have said .
of course , these must not act a a gateway for social dumping .
service provider must respect the law of the state in which they operate .
the country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently .
one of our greatest achievement is that one can now move legally .
after one year , we are on the way to doing this .
i wa also struck by what you said , mr rapti .
mr kelly mentioned that ireland wa the very last country to do so .
i myself am visiting the member state , a wa noted earlier .
mr løkkegaard mentioned my visit concerning these issue in particular .
mr harbour mentioned the performance test that we have begun .
mr president , this debate wa very interesting and illuminating .
please do not fall into the trap of comparing apple and orange .
we therefore really need to very closely monitor what happens .
the vote will take place at midday tomorrow , tuesday , 15 february .
now we are to do so a second time .
it is a purely procedural decision that is to be taken here .
when it come to the language issue , no progress ha been made .
the council ha formally asked u for our assent .
in the meantime , 25 member state are now behind this proposal .
we therefore need this qualitative progress to a european patent now .
there is currently no internal market in term of patent protection .
the applicant is obliged to work with 27 separate national legal system .
their clear expectation is that visible result be achieved within a reasonable time .
( it ) i turn now to our italian friend .
for this reason , my group will give it consent to enhanced cooperation .
in the worst case scenario , thing would remain a they are .
i do believe that we will make progress , however .
we are not relinquishing a single right , quite the opposite in fact .
it is quite simply too expensive and complicated , a we have heard .
we need to keep a sense of proportion here .
this wa not the intention of the convention when we discussed enhanced cooperation .
this is particularly important , especially for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector .
the recommendation and proposal of the european commission also point in this direction .
i think we should give more thought to this .
the commission , however , want to forge ahead with this .
the fact that it doe so is just another example of eu empire-building .
it is being driven forward by 12 country that include the united kingdom .
however , we are not here today to resolve a linguistic issue .
however , once again , this linguistic debate is not on the agenda .
he referred to innovation a 'our generation 's sputnik moment ' .
we must not allow 'our generation 's sputnik moment ' to slip away .
we support anything that improves and expands the internal market .
is it to do with politics , a i suspect ?
we must all now work to achieve better respect for all .
( e ) mr president , let u not delude ourselves .
i am grateful to the hungarian representative for speaking italian and spanish ...
however , i do have reservation about the language to be used .
time is the only resource which is not renewable .
we can not experience europe solely through austerity programme .
that is the first thing that ha to happen .
i remember working with klaus-heiner lehne on mr palacio 's report .
this continent - the european union - need to be more inventive .
we need to create more invention and exploit them more .
it is absolutely indispensable that we have a competitive patent system .
this enhanced cooperation move is an imaginative one to move the debate forward .
i would just like to deal with a few important point .
this presidency ha achieved a great deal in other area too .
the issue at stake here is a procedural decision .
in which case , why can the patent itself not be innovative ?
however , i believe it will benefit all researcher in the eu .
in other word , it will not have to pay any damage .
we need to encourage , stimulate , protect and remunerate creation and innovation .
this is one of the area in which europe ha another advantage .
let u guard that advantage ; let u strengthen and protect it .
mr roithová mentioned the word 'counterfeiting ' just now .
and will counterfeit good be able to enter all the other member state ?
i am referring , for example , to invention of medicine .
to achieve this , we must do everything we can .
i would also like to react to two other remark .
i believe that the belgian presidency actually did do all it could .
we need the single market and we need to strengthen it .
according to the treaty of lisbon , unanimity is the absolute exception .
the european patent office work in the language agreed in the epc .
the european patent convention will continue to apply for them .
however , it should also pay for this itself .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 15 february 2011 .
they must therefore be protected in every way and in every form .
what impact would a trilingual regime have on the work of this parliament ?
a more streamlined approach is essential for the union to remain competitive .
the cost incurred by inventor are too high and procedure are too complicated .
we have a new round of negotiation before u .
these are , obviously , top priority for the european union .
meanwhile , the constitutional and social context have evolved radically .
we are therefore proposing to make explicit provision for this .
that is a proposal we are going to present to the plenary tomorrow .
no explicit provision ha yet been made to that effect .
last but not least , there is the question of the legal basis .
most of the other amendment relate to this change of legal basis .
the commission belief that this amendment to the legal basis is unjustifiable .
we need clear guideline that everyone can have confidence in .
so the commission need to submit a full report on maximum permitted level .
we are all well aware of the importance of this debate .
we know this from chernobyl , yet not only because of chernobyl .
the problem of the maximum level remains , however .
we have the case of urgeiriça in portugal , for example .
it is important that we take all this into account .
this is the only way we can enhance our own security .
therefore , these are issue that interest me , mr harm .
i wa also the french agriculture minister not so long ago .
we therefore regret the fact that the commission is persisting in it view .
i thank you for your attention and your commitment .
they are , in fact , available from bank and venture capital fund .
in short , there is no need to ask brussels for them .
this is what ha been done a regard future financial programming .
the second wa to reduce cost by cutting red tape .
an excellent example of this is the service directive .
we will provide our support for this in parliament .
however , these rule have increased the loan cost for small business .
you want u to do away with bureaucracy and complicated procedure .
they provide many more job than do the larger firm .
here , i agree with what mr herczog said .
let u not forget this question in today 's debate .
we in the european union have adopted new legislation .
that is where it all start and then move down the chain .
secondly , these company , smes , are concerned about finance .
many would not have any financial problem if their invoice were paid .
the bank have retreated into their shell and are not serving their purpose .
we have heard the mantra of bank being too big to fail .
indeed , 23 million european smes are expecting positive action from the commission .
another important aspect is also the development of alternative source of funding .
particular attention must be focused on supporting large-scale funding for innovative company .
it is the private sector that creates the job .
on paper , we encounter one sme initiative after another .
innovation is vitally important for the survival of smes into the future .
these are some of the specific thing that also relate to simplification .
we shall continue with it and apply it strictly .
the vote will take place at midday on wednesday , 16 february 2011 .
i believe that over 1.8 million smes benefited from loan guarantee in 2009 .
europe must work towards creating a viable venture capital market a a priority .
i refer to the need to reduce administrative and bureaucratic burden .
smes must be able to operate without hindrance and to act quickly .
access to funding is therefore one of the greatest obstacle confronting smes today .
implementation of the eu strategy for the danube region ( debate )
which is not to say that innovation and progress are to be abandoned .
it is very important that the commission should not go beyond this .
however , both tender and instrument must be clearly defined .
this region connects 14 european country and 115 million european citizen .
this seems to be the case in the danube region .
there are plenty of opportunity for this in ongoing programme planning .
there will be follow-up conference , report , etc .
commissioner , you have proposed a contract for the future cohesion policy .
mr president , it is fortunate that mr hahn is the commissioner responsible .
there are too many priority , commissioner and fellow member .
this is a question that also need to be answered at european level .
this mean that we also need to find solution for conflicting interest .
i am referring here to the danube a it flow freely through bavaria .
this prior decision must be withdrawn at all cost .
this should also be reflected in parliament 's resolution .
with nothing working against each other , an integrated approach can really help .
under those condition , we are currently moving forward with the baltic sea .
good for the east and good for the west !
by this i mean real ownership of the process .
the greatest possible use should also be made of existing instrument and policy .
how can you ensure that the strategy is properly implemented under these condition ?
implementation should be regulated through a commission action plan .
the strategy for the danube region is genuinely a bottom-up process .
the danube region already ha a long history of cultural cooperation .
the fear relate to sustainability and the threat to the danube itself .
there are call for more money and indeed monetary support will be required .
this is a fundamental requirement if europe is to develop .
the first of these point relates to the issue of navigability .
there are two approach that can be combined intelligently .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 february 2011 .
these treasure are the earth 's oil , food and fresh water reserve .
the danube river basin is the backbone of a sustainable macro-regional structure .
the next item is the commission statement on cord blood stem cell .
similarly , adult stem cell are also showing promising potential .
the eu ha no competence to harmonise the use of cell .
providing such information is , again , the competence of the member state .
we can encourage it ; we can not dictate it .
well-informed mother in europe will clearly want to give life twice .
it is therefore important for u to have these bank .
that should be the opening that we aim for .
this false promise that is being sold to parent cost money .
in this context , i believe that we need a strategy .
this time , medicine is scarcely being mentioned a the election take place .
cord blood stem cell are one example of where progress ha been made .
i say this a a former rapporteur for the directive on advanced therapy .
that could be a good way of overcoming some of the difficulty .
many member state already have in place information campaign and other information activity .
the commission encourages member state to take such action .
until recently , this blood wa regarded a biological waste .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the only political option that did not condemn them ha been banned .
i have spoken here before about the case of the newspaper egunkaria .
there are other example , and they should not be repeated .
some done , but a lot more to do .
( e ) mr president , today is also european sexual health day .
in order to combat all of this , we need a european strategy .
we are not to be pushed around by putin .
the problem is turkey 's intransigent and arbitrary policy .
for this , i would like your support and attention .
young people and woman have been hit hardest by the economic crisis .
the child 's father , an egyptian national , is ignoring this decision .
i ask for your assistance in returning young adam to his mother .
that wa not true , however , a we now know .
this is in stark contrast to event in the german parliament .
that is exactly what i want to call on parliament to do .
today , food price are approaching those of 2008 .
the main reason for this low figure is to do with financial constraint .
two type of measure can be devised for this .
the second type of measure relates to increasing grant for student exchange .
firstly , this model is only intended for euro area member state .
emission performance standard for new light commercial vehicle ( debate )
i hope that colleague will join me in supporting the package today .
nevertheless , this compromise still represents an important step forward .
transport must make a substantial contribution to the eu 's overall co2 target .
mr president , the first reading should be the exception .
we can be proud of what we have achieved .
overall , we are therefore pleased with the compromise .
the industry committee is prepared to support the entire package .
she ha done an excellent job on this dossier .
overall , we are all pleased with the compromise .
nevertheless , we faced major environmental and economic challenge .
we must keep a very close eye on how the situation develops .
this mean that the air quality in our city will improve .
some comment have already been made about the first reading .
we should make sure in future that we reach fewer first-reading agreement .
we did not need to introduce that into the second reading .
i would like to thank everyone concerned once again .
i am pleased that we have achieved a large majority for this compromise .
however , i will not be expressing my thanks for the agreement .
it will not do the competitiveness of the car industry any good .
the question is where are we going to sell car in 2020 ?
it will , of course , be much higher than that .
european competitiveness is not and will not be assisted by hobbling european industry .
i would like to end by thanking all of the rapporteur .
the commission proposed a reduction target of 135 gram of co2 per kilometre .
in my opinion , that would have been feasible .
this feeble compromise is a gift to the industry .
small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife .
it will put it up by at least eur 5 000 .
the first is how no one talk about global warming anymore .
if it wa not such a tragedy , it would be a farce .
globally , 2010 wa one of the two hottest year in recorded history .
i think everyone will agree with what ha been said .
therefore , all this is really a step in the right direction .
i am also glad to see that there are penalty .
i suspect it will not increase it by a single euro .
the fact is that oil price are now at usd 100 a barrel .
that is more than the commission estimated when it undertook it assessment .
the manufacturer have made great technological progress over recent year .
he know it will , and i know it will .
this is what the uk independence party is so determined to fight against .
in doing so , it want business to pay more than they need .
the motor industry is of vital importance in the european union .
i believe that the target for reducing emission are both ambitious and realistic .
manufacturer will have to achieve 147 gram of co2 per kilometre by 2020 .
the directive now need to be introduced a quickly a possible .
instead , we simply need to do what is possible .
therefore , the cost of these vehicle must remain manageable .
i would like to make two comment by way of conclusion .
this also applies to the case of vehicle emission .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i will be brief .
however , emission in the transport sector have increased by almost 30 % .
in other word , we need to focus heavily on developing public transport .
we must not increase the burden on small and medium-sized company .
we will achieve much more by moving from individual transport to public transport .
we in europe are very dependent on import of raw material for energy .
it would also have translated into saving for the consumer .
that wa also an answer to mr vlasák and his concern .
i would not be surprised if the same thing happens with van .
i appreciate the very broad support for this piece of legislation .
i have to say that i simply do not understand that remark .
mr wils compared this regulation with the passenger car regulation .
in my view , that is a false comparison .
there is already a much higher diesel penetration in the van market .
this will result in overall cost saving for many business .
in conclusion , i think this is a good result .
the vote will take place at midday today ( 15 february 2011 ) .
that said , we need to combine ambition with realism and good sense .
right of passenger in bus and coach transport ( debate )
a regulation that would protect non-discriminatory access to transport by bus and coach ;
the main problem were primarily encountered in defining the scope of application .
the final text can be deemed a pleasing and balanced compromise .
together , they worked tirelessly in helping to move thing forward .
let me congratulate you on a job well done .
let me convey my heartfelt thanks to you for making this happen .
i am of the opinion that the text represents a very well-balanced compromise .
i think the scope of the report is correct .
we have said that three country are not directly affected .
therefore , it is not realistic to criticise u for excluding local transport .
this can be dealt with at a regional level .
two question spring to mind when you look at this particular agreement .
there are some positive aspect to all of this .
that , of course , is not a good thing .
another aspect is the distance of 250 kilometre which ha already been mentioned .
this must be taken into consideration during the implementation process .
we are familiar with this position of the council from previous conciliation proceeding .
they have achieved what is a genuinely very reasonable compromise .
i regard the following element a being particularly positive :
3. compensation and assistance in case of an accident .
i also consider the improved information for passenger to be positive ;
passenger must receive updated information in real time by electronic mean .
however , some point in the proposal go too far .
company now have to pay for delay which they have not caused .
we must avoid inappropriate measure like this in future .
people with reduced mobility have been granted more right in this regard here .
having said that , this regulation completes the list .
we now have european rule on passenger right for all transport mode .
this should be enforced on the ground , in particular .
for these reason , we want to support this compromise .
air travel is not the same a bus travel .
indeed , it would put many of them out of business .
however , our effort and enthusiasm for regulation should have clear boundary .
madam president , this provision is a little like the curate 's egg .
i live myself over 300 kilometre from our capital .
we will have to monitor this a we go forward .
the number of people with disability will skyrocket overnight .
in the case of bus , it is two hour .
we face this challenge with all passenger right legislation .
for the above reason , i fully support the adoption of the report .
i would like to congratulate mr cancian on his work .
we also have a duty to monitor whether the regulation is properly applied .
the number of case to support this statement is unacceptably high .
this is a matter of serious concern to u .
all of these freedom are enshrined in the constitution of the russian federation .
the situation in the northern caucasus is particularly worrying and need urgent action .
overall , the current report ha not been a very positive one .
we are engaged in a serious dialogue with russia on human right .
today , after lisbon , we are a powerful political institution .
this imposes on u more responsibility , pragmatism and self-restraint .
we should not let ourselves be led by emotion .
we should not be casual with our value either .
we are not allowed to be simultaneously prosecutor and judge .
the russian authority are evidently implementing unconstitutional law and order .
the european union must be consistent in it policy towards third country .
we can not continue normal relation unless concrete improvement are made in russia .
this is also clear from the fall in the number of appeal .
controlled democracy go hand in hand with controlled justice .
they have not been outraged ; they have been honoured .
this example illustrates the degree to which extreme freedom ...
( the president cut off the speaker but the speaker continued off-microphone )
dear colleague , this is a discussion on russia .
the item on the agenda is the situation in russia .
i also think that we need to develop more expertise at home .
madam president , i am sorry , i wa not listening .
madam president , i will vote for the resolution , yes .
i very much share the concern expressed here by many of you .
two thing in particular delighted me during this discussion .
russia is a permanent issue on the agenda of the foreign affair council .
any decision on restrictive measure would be for the council to take .
such instrument should be wielded wisely on the basis of clear evidence .
in conclusion , i will briefly sum up some of my previous point .
the european union must stand ready to support russia in these effort .
the north caucasus region remains a source of deep concern for u .
the high representative will be duly informed of your opinion .
the vote will take place at midday on thursday , 17 february 2011 .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:45 and resumed at 12:00 )
the extrajudicial record of the russian state is already a tradition .
the eu 's policy should take stock of this deplorable practice .
after all , the eu should know how to recognise such a problem .
madam president , i hope i can make myself heard above the din .
agreement between the ec and south africa on trade , development and cooperation (
agreement between the european community and brazil on certain aspect of air service (
enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection (
although i wa not able to vote , my vote is against .
i would like this to be recorded in the minute .
that mechanism should be based on the polluter-pays principle .
this is a joint proposal by five political group .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
our overriding aim wa to facilitate the provision of service throughout europe .
now , thanks to this directive , they have lost everything .
however , the implementation of the directive is stalling .
the implication ha been that they have been underfunded and not provided well .
however , that is only the case over longer distance .
many of the other point are not worthy of a european directive .
these are the reason why our group abstained in the vote .
acknowledging the need of the disabled always brings with it clear added value .
i am not particularly happy with the compromise reached .
most rural area are outside the 250 kilometre limit .
in many case , there is no alternative public transport service available .
passenger will have 12 basic right applying to any length of journey .
european union citizen will be able to feel better protected .
the act function only partially in several other member state .
the problem in connection with cross-border coach travel is also unresolved .
commercial vehicle are on the road every day and they travel huge distance .
we did not choose this path and that is why i voted against .
that would really help our enterprise to compete on the global market .
i think it would have been a better idea to start harmonising them .
in particular , the new system should help stimulate scientific research and innovation .
using enhanced cooperation is , in my opinion , an absolute dead end .
i abstained from voting because the language arrangement are still not entirely clear .
citizen ' interest in the effective management of post-accident situation must be guaranteed .
i voted in favour of this document , because it includes important amendment .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
the worsening of the economic and financial crisis of capitalism bear this out .
south africa is an important partner both for trade and development relation .
this agreement ha a five-year review clause following it entry into force .
iceland can export fishery produce to the eu tariff-free .
the commission ha tabled a proposal for four agreement to parliament .
in practical term , it provides an overall package of eur 1.8 billion .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
in the case of brazil , this concern is even more pressing .
the interpretation provided by the judicial authority violates the commitment undertaken .
for the above reason , i voted in favour of the document .
the 41 kilometre that separate the two country became an external schengen border .
switzerland joined the schengen area alone , on 12 december 2008 .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the coelho report .
the 41 kilometre that separate the two country became an external schengen border .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
the jurisdiction ha now implemented 98.4 % of eu directive into domestic law .
the 41 km that separate the two country became an external schengen border .
the negotiation were concluded and the draft protocol wa initialled .
i welcome this fact and am voting in favour of the present report .
we need to enforce the common eu visa policy without delay .
however , not everyone from the european union ha the same privilege .
this mean that the 'reciprocity principle ' is not being respected .
today 's vote on the eu-brazil air service agreement brings significant mutual benefit .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 )
we need to take measure in this area without delay .
we need to enforce the eu 's visa reciprocity policy without delay .
the interpretation provided by the judicial authority violates the commitment undertaken .
this agreement will cover about 90-95 % of all traveller .
technological and financial aid will ensure food competitiveness and low price .
the other member state have concluded bilateral agreement directly with brazil .
the macovei recommendation is also significant for another reason .
i voted to approve this agreement a the european parliament 's rapporteur .
however , not everyone from the european union ha the same privilege .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
the interpretation provided by the judicial authority violates the commitment undertaken .
this agreement affect holder of diplomatic , service and official passport .
this wa not the case until the treaty of lisbon came into force .
it wa for these reason that i voted in favour .
the potential benefit deriving from the implementation of the service directive are incontrovertible .
firstly , the point of single contact ( psc ) .
their purpose is to facilitate the provision of service across europe .
these pscs are the key to the success of the service directive .
parliament even insisted on this point when presenting it view to the council .
splitting up the legislative amendment ha resulted in a process that lack transparency .
it would be more useful to investigate the implementation process more closely .
this instrument may be significantly important to small and medium-sized enterprise .
moreover , business people should receive assistance in completing the necessary administrative procedure .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
this is probably why there is no roll-call vote .
the name of those responsible will not be known .
the eu provides a wide range of opportunity for service provider in particular .
the system established ha significantly reduced the amount of administrative obstacle .
this objective can only be reached by developing and implementing shared rule .
this will promote the creation of new job and help fight unemployment .
the report is also too optimistic about the possibility of job being created .
in writing . - i strongly endorse the gebhardt report .
the commission should earmark fund for a promotional campaign .
strengthening the control option in the destination country represents an important step forward .
the eu should not have the right to make law for the uk .
the eu should not have the right to make law for the uk .
however , making them liable can only help improve the service offered .
the eu should not have the right to make law for the uk .
the regulation is intended to ensure access to transport without discrimination .
this represents important progress with regard to defending citizen ' right .
only distance greater than 250 km will be covered .
parliament ha , however , settled for a cut-price , poorly drawn-up agreement .
particular attention ha been paid to disabled person and person with reduced mobility .
parliament wanted to apply the rule to journey of more than 50 km .
protecting consumer is a key priority of the labour party in europe .
passenger who travel for part of these long-distance journey are also covered .
until now , bus and coach passenger were in a much worse situation .
this is an example of good , citizen-focused legislation .
however , we must not forget the question of road safety .
by comparison , in sweden , there are 39 death per million inhabitant .
this is an important step in uniting europe against discrimination .
in 2020 , the limit will drop to 147 gram .
it is an ambitious , but feasible , plan .
currently , light commercial vehicle make up around 12 % of the fleet .
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work so far .
in my opinion , the sanction should be the same in both area .
however , we have to combine ambition with realism and common sense .
the future is calling , but we are not listening .
i welcome this compromise and have therefore supported it .
all change must be made to the engine or mechanic instead .
there is also concern that they may reduce competitiveness in this sector .
i am glad to see that my amendment were taken into consideration .
the regulation will not burden them with excessive cost .
two year ago , legislation on car emission wa approved .
the objective indicated aim to encourage innovation in the industry .
the sense of urgency ha disappeared , that much is clear .
furthermore , this protection will finally come at an affordable price .
patent protection is one of the basic instrument for competitiveness and economic growth .
i believe it is essential to resolve the matter of the european patent .
however , i have reservation about the language arrangement to be established .
i think the enhanced cooperation procedure ha been used cynically .
we voted against this report for three fundamental reason .
the purpose behind it inclusion is starting to become clear .
i am thinking here of the manufacturer of generic medicine , for example .
the european union can not afford a fragmented patent registration system .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
however , eu body and institution do not always succeed in this .
this will certainly reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved .
i voted against the introduction of a trilingual system in patent regulation .
the belgian presidency of the european union ha been a complete success .
the other political group have not supported our request for postponement .
the consent doe not concern specific measure implementing enhanced cooperation .
i have therefore voted in favour of the report .
we must realise that europe ha fallen behind in the global innovation competition .
in the united state , around eur 1 850 suffices .
this make a european patent 10 time more expensive than a u one .
pre-established maximum permitted level of contamination must be applied to foodstuff and feedingstuffs .
it is for the above reason that i abstained in the final vote .
all people have the right to a healthy diet .
therefore , our final vote wa one of abstention .
the ecr group therefore voted in favour of this report .
who would be given the responsibility for such a task ?
the same applies to forest , although to a lesser degree .
i therefore voted in favour of adopting the report .
preventive measure and aid for those affected are important .
i have taken these consideration into account when voting .
food which is produced and consumed locally doe not need to be irradiated .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the opinion that the commission ha just adopted make explicit mention of that .
what we are talking about today is a question of general european interest .
we must move forward quickly and properly on this subject .
that is the essential lesson that we have learned from the crisis .
this document say and show clearly that the current policy are not sufficient .
we must do more to respond to current challenge .
we must do more together , and we must not be divided .
i think i can say that we can count on your support here .
the council should be available for discussion over the next few day .
i am delighted to hear that you also share these reservation .
basically , in what direction is this train setting off ?
what procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place ?
will there be a role for the european parliament ?
can we reach a majority in favour of a simplified procedure ?
i think that there are still some condition that need to be met .
mr wortmann-kool and other rapporteur have tabled six proposal .
this problem can also be resolved through article 136 .
i would like to make a third and final comment .
it is because the intergovernmental method is not working .
the irish believe that the german bank are being rescued at their expense .
i would now like to see this being put into practice .
i would like to say one more thing at this point .
the fund that we currently have available are not sufficient .
a decision wa made in brussels today to provide more liquidity .
we will soon have to talk about this again and also about eurobonds .
mr verhofstadt ha provided the correct justification for this .
half of the uk 's trade is with eurozone country .
the city of london is the financial capital of europe .
let u look at the interest rate of the german bund .
exactly a mr gualtieri said , it is a crucial moment .
economic governance is a trap and moreover , it ha no mandate .
this is about making the european financial stabilisation fund permanent .
in fact , they are known only too well .
the treaty did not establish a permanent stability mechanism .
this wa a unanimous decision by the member state .
that is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in .
they can not imagine what war might be like .
we will have to do this with our historical experience .
like others , i am concerned about the mechanism .
national parliament are given six month to decide what they may do .
surely they have to wait until june to make that decision ?
treaty modification are always complex , even simplified one .
it is true that we are being listened to .
a lot of valid remark have already been made in this respect .
i would like to add three point which are of fundamental importance .
when the euro wa first introduced , the same figure wa usd 1.17 .
the value of an international currency is based on it external value .
however , the internal structure of the euro is not at all stable .
the problem is not that europe can not act in a consistent way .
the problem is that europe can not agree on a consistent procedure .
the european union is being politically transformed for the future .
mr weber said that 'european citizen want to see a stronger europe ' .
mr president , a new stability mechanism is proposed .
mr president , well , here we go again .
this change is necessary in order to protect weaker eurozone economy .
therefore , a real strategy for global competitiveness need to emerge .
if you bet against the euro , you will lose your money .
that is a very important message to send out .
my last remark is to mr higgins from ireland .
of course , we expect that any future government would respect the deal .
since then , important legislative development have taken place in greece .
it is a subject that concern the people of europe .
this make it clear that the enforcement process is not working .
it is needed now more than it ever ha been .
now , with algeria , the pressure ha shifted to italy .
proper , fundamental solidarity must be established between the member state .
unfortunately , this case is not at all unique .
it is important that we avoid more case like this one .
europe ha made a mess of it own asylum system .
indeed , it is not an à la carte menu .
the sudden influx of tunisian refugee is fresh evidence of this .
in any case , she can count on my commitment .
however , greece is also the victim of it bad neighbour , turkey .
finally , the european asylum legislation should be a great deal more stringent .
others go to malta , some probably go to portugal and spain .
it go without saying that here again , dublin ii will be applied .
following this decision , clear measure are now needed immediately .
germany ha also decided no longer to send asylum seeker back to greece .
in lampedusa , this is because of current event in tunisia .
dublin ii can not continue in it current form .
the judgment is therefore important due to the precedent that it set .
how many people could be awaiting judgment having appealed against denied asylum application ?
how many people could apply for compensation due to delay in proceeding ?
nor do all the member state have the same procedure .
we are tired of talking about abuse and trafficker .
for u , this is all about protecting fundamental right and human right .
we need sensible asylum process for these people which function properly .
i agree completely with my colleague , mr hirsch , on that point .
this will remove the legal basis for deception on humanitarian ground .
asylum procedure must be dealt with immediately and in the best possible way .
we also need to accelerate our work to establish a common asylum system .
people need to be treated in a decent way .
we need to ensure protection for the most vulnerable .
on greece , the commission is doing a lot to help .
it ha done a lot , but need to do more .
lately , turkey ha shown itself to be constructive and cooperative .
we have finalised the negotiation on a readmission agreement after eight year .
of that number , 12 638 ( 77 % ) were accepted .
we are ready to assist both italy and tunisia .
i know preparation at technical level are being made .
i invite all member state to show their support .
this is , of course , also a priority .
of course , a medium-term strategy must also be further developed .
they should be sent back to tunisia where they came from .
i think that it is about time that the commission implemented this article .
it is time to say that no country is alone .
the lesson of recent week ha really not been learnt .
this is one of the main requirement of the democratic transformation of tunisia .
all that is lacking is the political will and the sense of solidarity .
this is the real political challenge that europe must face up to .
( nl ) mr president , we have a real emergency in europe .
the european border appears to be a leaky a a sieve .
regarding the mediterranean , today we have nothing to say .
we shall appreciate your good intention and stop there .
( it ) mr president , thank you for the question .
( fr ) yes , it wa the last speaker but two .
we know that this problem concern italy , but it also concern europe .
what should i tell my constituent who are afraid ?
what can the commission do , and what can frontex do ?
the second level is more strictly political in nature .
it is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policy .
talking doe not cost anything , but we need to act .
the fact is , commissioner , that these are uncomfortable subject .
the problem we are discussing is both technical and political .
whoever come to malta will have no choice but to remain .
the eu ha learnt nothing from it past experience .
it wa taken completely by surprise by the stream of refugee .
ten of thousand of them are already waiting in the neighbouring country .
we can not do it all alone , however .
we need to address this with the utmost urgency .
that would also be a good trip to make .
the authority are no longer able to control the situation .
we must not respond by closing door and by equating immigrant with criminal .
the problem of north africa can not be resolved in southern europe .
in addition , there is , of course , the public relation problem .
hence , the key thing are : faster procedure and better public relation .
image from these country have dominated the news over the last few day .
we must remember what these country have really achieved .
if these young people have no future prospect , they will come back .
perhaps not the same people , but constant stream of new migrant .
this is why we need to deal with this problem now .
( el ) madam president , the mediterranean is going up in flame .
europe today ha just 2.7 % of the muslim population .
we have to act in solidarity with italy and we can do so .
tomorrow , it will be in malta and crete .
frontex is also involved in doing analysis for the whole region .
lady ashton wa there yesterday for discussion with the authority .
we are ready to offer election support to them in carrying out election .
i think many were quite surprised when the berlin wall fell .
we did not have an action plan immediately up our sleeve .
the debate we are dealing with today is particularly important .
italy immediately turned to the european union to request prompt action .
right now , it is important that european solidarity should function properly .
adequate , sustainable and safe european pension system ( debate )
it wa not easy to manage such a large number of amendment .
you can not link derivative and pension fund , just like that .
in a pension fund , derivative are used to hedge risk .
so even there , commission , you must look before you leap .
it seems to me that we should not harbour unrealistic expectation .
you can only use individual saving opportunity if you also have the money .
finally , i would like to make two concluding comment .
third , we must draw lesson from the financial and economic crisis .
it also clearly identifies policy area where the eu can add value .
state must not shirk their obligation to provide adequate pension for all citizen .
i would like the rapporteur to comment on this .
the former restores stability , while the latter endangers it .
i think this is the start of that process .
but the core question is : who is responsible ?
finally , i support the inclusion of pension liability within the sgp .
there is double speak here , with eu control overturning principle .
pension system fall within the competence of the member state .
in my opinion , this simply will not work .
this is a good opportunity for u to do the groundwork .
there , you have pointed to the importance of solvency ii .
so , there is a job that need doing .
in future , job in the social sector must be better paid .
people want proper , secure pension in their old age .
the public ha financed the rescue package for the major bank .
previous pension reform are already leading to increasing poverty in old age .
the only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension system .
life expectancy will continue to increase and the birth rate will remain low .
young people will be starting work later and later .
i would like to give mr andor a clear message .
i should like to refer to two key aspect of these essential reform .
i think she ha done a very good job .
but what we can do is share best practice and experience .
i am sorry that this wa not in the report .
the eu should provide the criterion for the minimum pension .
the eu should persuade member state to raise the retirement age .
the eu should encourage competition between european pension fund and further privatisation .
individual country should be responsible for their own policy and reform .
saver deserve transparent information , which is easy to understand and available .
risk for pension are not the same a insurance company or bank .
mr mann gave a detailed description of the german occupational pension system .
current forecast indicate that the number of dependant in europe will soon double .
the bottom line is that they , too , should be working .
extending one 's working life must result in an improved pension .
this standard also need to look to the future .
should we not instead be attempting to resolve the really urgent problem ?
this is why we need to take step in this area .
with the white paper , we are just wasting time .
this pose a threat to the sustainability of the pension system .
national budget can not secure a decent old age .
i do not know where mr de jong is .
i hope that satisfies you , mr de jong .
the demographic situation is not in our favour either .
therefore , the system 's sustainability is an urgent problem .
we must also consider the possibility of free movement within the eu .
it should pay to have child , rather than just being a cost .
a responsible constitutional court would necessarily describe such a law a unconstitutional .
we can not support the planned crime of the century !
the commission should make a clearer call for equality between men and woman .
woman more often have atypical employment contract than men .
appropriate and secure pension system represent long-term intergenerational contract .
let me give the example of my own country .
this procedure ha passed through two commissioner and four presidency .
a member will know , falsified medicine are different from counterfeit product .
i would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteur .
this would have led to different level of protection in the european union .
the commission ha always supported a european approach in this regard .
finally , parliament insisted on rule concerning online sale of medicine .
i would have liked the proposal to go further on this front .
pharmacist also need access to trustworthy supply of quality product .
yet i do not think our work end there .
we will need to monitor carefully how this directive is implemented .
madam president , lady and gentleman , we can all imagine the nightmare .
someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation .
we are grateful to the commission for producing this proposal .
it is true that we have been discussing it for some time .
we have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation .
medicine can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist .
however , we are also not compromising on patient safety .
all of this will improve safety level and increase patient ' confidence .
there is an early warning system throughout the european union for contaminated food .
everyone who buy medicine on the internet can do so independently .
this wa a huge task and she ha done very well .
i believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved .
we have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefit .
we have laid down tighter control on prescription medicine a a first step .
a they say , rome wa not built in a day .
i look forward to building on the foundation of this directive .
all too often , we adopt legislation that is imprecise and unclear .
this must not happen in such an important case a this .
these are only those case that have come to light .
i am very pleased that this scheme ha addressed that issue .
i suppose that is up to each individual member state .
the other 99 % come from illegal channel and the black market .
we all know that the pharmaceutical industry is very big business .
we will never be able to prevent the production of fake medicine .
could we try and find a happy medium , please .
there is also one point on which we will need to be vigilant .
initially , we had a very heated discussion on this subject .
this wa a warning which prompted u to speed up our work .
we have now produced result that we can be really satisfied with .
however , i would like to make one request .
i am very pleased that parallel trade ha been retained .
it is therefore excellent that this will apply throughout the eu .
we will do everything in our power to ensure proper traceability .
this is the policy we have to push forward .
the commission explained to u that this would be impossible to achieve .
i would like to mention something else with regard to this commitment .
this situation is exploited by criminal group throughout the world .
the pharmaceutical industry is one of the three most lucrative industry .
i welcome the inclusion of safety device on the medicine ' packaging .
the involvement of broker is undoubtedly a positive step .
the next item is question time ( b7-0009/2011 ) .
the product remained authorised in france , portugal , luxembourg and greece .
what action will the commission be taking in this connection ?
so rest assured that action will be taken , if necessary .
ha the commission considered halting funding to the gfatm ?
this accounted for approximately 50 % of the fund 's total resource .
member of the commission . - there are two side to this issue .
but , on the other hand , they are public fund .
so we need to find a solution very rapidly .
we have identified the area where we need this : at national level .
then i would say that i wa thinking only of sick people .
i want to thank the commissioner for his reply .
secondly , i believe that we should be exploiting it more .
i assure you that i am committed to ever better information .
subject : uneven environment for growth and development in member state
first of all , with regard to the china helpdesk .
it seems to be more suited to larger-scale enterprise .
that ha worked best for trade and investment in both area .
perhaps that should be the standard to be followed .
what should we do to make it easier to access eu financing ?
smes are therefore seeing sign of real support from this direction a well .
i have held quite a number of meeting on microcredit a well .
we would , of course , like to continue with this same effort .
however , here is an additional question i would like to ask you .
nevertheless , you did not answer my question very clearly .
of course , we have to look at the baseline .
i agree with you that it wa very low .
of course , these condition are being created gradually .
what are the lesson to be learned in this process ?
i think that after that , we will see appropriate result .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:50 and resumed at 21:00 )
the next item is the commission statement on the situation in albania .
it ha become a country with a european perspective .
the development in tirana on friday , 21 january 2011 , were tragic .
the increasingly bitter political stalemate ha resulted in four needle death .
this is the shared responsibility of the political leader in albania .
that is what the citizen of albania expect , and they are right .
these investigation should be conducted by the judicial authority without political interference .
we can help to bridge the gap through our active engagement .
rather , they bring clear , measurable benefit for citizen .
the european parliament also ha a vital role to play .
you a politician can send a clear message to politician .
other political force and civil society organisation would benefit from european integration .
this includes functioning democratic institution which are used properly .
the parliament is the place where democratic debate should take place .
this is why the citizen have elected the member of the parliament .
the socialist party should take responsibility for it role a parliamentary opposition .
i hope that his assurance doe not involve any condition or loophole .
sometimes calmer , at other time violent , this crisis ha no end .
we support the commission approach , and that of commissioner füle in particular .
i have spoken to the representative of the two main political party there .
none of them wa able to come up with an answer .
new election will take place in may and the preparation are under way .
mr president , the crisis in albania is nothing new .
so are corruption , manipulation of the medium and political appointment .
both side need to start to move in order to reach that stage .
how do you get both party that far , though ?
when that happens , we will be able to grant albania candidate status .
unfortunately , that did not bring about any change .
i think that we should hold the prospect of a sanction over them .
we would really be harming the citizen if we did that .
democratic institution are weak and press freedom is scarce .
nato leader must now question whether albanian membership wa granted too soon .
albania is , after all , a secular country in practice .
i do not think that this will bring about any particular result .
surely , a country with young people like that must have a future .
because , if you do , they will destroy our nation 's future .
i wish you a great deal of strength and success in this .
we should not allow this political crisis and tension to go any further .
albania is awaiting the local election of may this year .
this will be another check on democracy in the country .
he is used to addressing and resolving tricky problem .
i wish both of them the best of luck .
i admit that i wa sceptical when this debate started .
of course , we still have our political affinity and our personal friendship .
however , we do not want albania to be isolated .
we want it to start out on the road towards europe .
i agree with those who say that this need to be investigated .
it is important to find out who is really to blame .
the parliament fully supported the liberalisation process which ha already been mentioned .
the other possibility would be to freeze the ipa fund .
what are your plan in the event that no solution can be reached ?
we must therefore be more vigorous in defending democracy in albania .
reaching a consensus is something entirely new in albania .
the government which wa subsequently formed wa also something new for albania .
two party which can not stand each other sat down and worked together .
two opposing group have come together to help albania to make progress .
not the sort that we have in my country or in yours .
we have to go before the constitutional court or the election commission .
it is not always possible to bring everything onto the same level .
this is not possible , because the constitution doe not allow it .
how can negotiation take place about this if it is not allowed ?
now the situation ha escalated and four people have been killed .
it is good that you have attempted today to present a road map .
however , it may be exaggerating slightly to describe it in that way .
mr president , i welcome the statement by the commissioner .
the bloodshed of 21 january dragged tirana backwards by several year .
is it possible that we failed to address the country 's true problem ?
it is a pity , but it is a reality .
we experienced this very acutely in greece in the 1990s .
but there wa another question : whether we are considering sanction .
we have a clear idea of how to do this .
albania urgently need to implement the 12 key priority of the opinion .
the leader of albania must act now for the benefit of their people .
the next item is the commission statement on the eavesdropping scandal in bulgaria .
the general principle of eu law must also be respected .
for the commission , bulgarian legislation seems to comply with these requirement .
the issue at stake here concern the enforcement of legal obligation .
there is also established parliamentary scrutiny of this legal system .
yes , we fully support the fight against corruption .
why is everything not given to the judicial authority ?
why is it filtered by the ministry of the interior ?
what doe the ministry of the interior do with what is coming in ?
you mentioned schengen and , yes , we want the schengen border extended .
you stated that only one or two percent are used in court .
mr president , we have received different figure from bulgarian source .
( bg ) mr president , just a quick question , mr swoboda .
secondly , the important thing is how it is used .
this may be politically motivated or it may be personally motivated .
ha that led to a lessening of the regard for right ?
it appears that people feel that they are being pressurised to withdraw signature .
i would ask the commission to watch this space very carefully .
the situation in bulgaria , however , is particularly strange .
apparently , this is for the fight against corruption and organised crime .
while you were in power , kidnapping were a daily occurrence .
the mafia wa all-powerful , while citizen had no right .
however , it will not work , because the voter are not blind .
they are publicly available to anyone who care about the truth .
however , i would like to ask a question .
furthermore , the ruling party is not entitled to chair the committee .
not because of bulgaria , but because we are a community of value .
for that reason , the commission must investigate this .
situation like this can only lead to further social violence .
here , insinuation have been made which are completely unproven .
there , the aim wa to bring the two major party together .
why have i not heard you state a single fact ?
why do you not go to the subcommittee on security and defence ?
i ask the commission to familiarise itself with these finding .
the stockholm programme ha not been consigned to the museum .
so what is it that ha provoked the debate in this house today ?
i would like to make a little joke here .
i repeat : what is happening here this evening is pitiful and disgraceful .
bulgaria 's reputation is being tarnished for the sake of short-term political gain .
illegal phone tapping ha become prosecutor ' investigation method of choice .
that is what the bulgarian electorate voted for in 2009 .
this is an infringement of a number of european directive .
it is an infringement of the charter of fundamental right .
this is not a question of propaganda or a party political campaign .
show arrest have been carried out with deliberate heavy-handedness .
that is the style used by mussolini and it concern me greatly .
it would have significantly improved the quality of this debate .
i just want to express my disappointment at what mr strasser said .
( lt ) mr president , this really is a rather complex issue .
however , the fundamental idea is to respect human right .
behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end .
for this particular sector , we have specific legislation .
if it is not breached , it will not act .
these problem can not be tackled by fossil fuel .
fossil fuel have a disastrous impact on health , environment and climate .
fossil fuel create centralised , hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution .
we have to assist developing country to leapfrog our destructive fossil fuel path .
only renewables can bring a solution to these problem .
decentralised power supply are in the hand of the people .
nevertheless , the world bank continues to push fossil in it energy strategy .
this is not what an energy revolution look like .
the world bank 's energy policy suffers from a lack of transparency .
also , carbon capture and storage do not make coal power low carbon .
this is fortune telling and not research , and certainly not policy making .
this is not low carbon and this is not sustainable .
we have known about these problem for two decade now .
we have seen a slight change in this strategy .
my point is that we should address this issue with all seriousness .
so i believe that we need to understand the scale of the challenge .
the second point that we need to take into account is growth .
we should respond to growth in demand with supply .
there is an additional fundamental challenge because of the scale of this .
i also believe that there is a lot of untapped potential .
at the beginning , we need to lead by example .
a major instrument in this framework is the acp investment facility .
the facility finance infrastructure and climate friendly energy project .
all project financed by the world bank must have this aim .
i would like to make a number of comment .
i would like to congratulate mr keller on her excellent work .
it is a if they were assumption unworthy of discussion .
there are many , many others , taking climate change into account .
where are the sustainable forest in the amazon or in vietnam ?
where are the solar panel and wind turbine in kenya ?
we have to understand that million of people have been radicalised .
they have simply said 'we have had enough ! ' .
rural area are a special case when it come to energy requirement .
the world bank could therefore act a a partner to the developing country .
this will play a central role in development cooperation .
i think a few point need to be made more precise .
the question is : do we finance them or do we not ?
it is a genuine opportunity to respond to energy challenge .
now it seems that we are well on track .
the world bank make the whole process very open .
there will be the world bank energy week in washington .
otherwise , many people could attempt to evade this challenge .
it is definitely a question of where to start .
you can not do too much on energy with eur 200 million .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 february 2011 .
enlargement is a key driver for political and economic reform .
let me now speak very briefly about the outstanding issue .
we are therefore very close to the conclusion of the negotiation .
i will now give the floor to the commissioner responsible for that policy .
i would therefore like to thank the shadow rapporteur once again .
the commissioner ha come up with the key word today .
croatia is ready for accession to the european union now .
croatia belongs in a historical and cultural context with slovenia and hungary .
please allow me to add just one more sentence .
i agree with mr posselt that it is a fair report .
we can not give up on this objective for the western balkan .
some of you have mentioned chapter 23 on corruption .
now it is being handed out without a shot being fired .
croatia ha had to make extensive and intrusive legislative change .
the report here say that editor and journalist complain about undue political pressure .
more work ought to be done in this regard .
effective investigation , prosecution and court ruling are needed .
the eu must be proactive and not simply place the responsibility on croatia .
there are two point i would like to stress here today .
the first is the reform and strengthening of the judiciary .
otherwise , effort to tackle corruption and organised crime will have no effect .
it go without saying that there are still area requiring improvement and completion .
i hope that this is achieved a soon a possible .
that is beyond dispute and i am pleased about that .
the protection of human right is a key issue for the eu .
it turned out that the answer wa several ten of thousand in total .
the accession of croatia mark the beginning of the change of that situation .
instead , we need to make clear what still need to be done .
there ha also been some movement with regard to dealing with war crime .
we have a duty to make a success of this accession .
those benefit will have to be clearly communicated in the month to come .
this is also underlined in your report and resolution .
we all know that what we have here is unfinished business .
the vote will take place at 12:00 today , tuesday , 16 february .
we hope that croatia make fast progress in the negotiation for eu membership .
it show that the country is close to completing the accession negotiation .
even the 2010 return of serbian refugee wa very limited .
this process requires profound reform which are often highly unpopular with the public .
the question is what this step will be like .
the position of croatia in the western balkan is of strategic importance .
significant progress ha also been made in improving relation with neighbouring country .
the european parliament must clearly support croatia 's accession effort .
indeed , it is of particular importance for all of u .
let me emphasise some important element concerning economic governance .
this is the major challenge for europe in the year to come .
mr president-in-office , thank you for your introductory speech .
we are talking about a very important issue : the europe 2020 strategy .
employment policy is therefore absolutely crucial , including under the 2020 strategy .
managing the european semester will be a real test for the eu .
the annual growth survey is very clear about the top priority .
however , i want to be clear on this .
your role a co legislator is fundamental to their successful implementation .
discussion of the new multiannual financial framework will start soon .
we would simply like to draw your attention to three point .
the first concern the content of this annual growth survey .
we believe that this constitutes an extremely dangerous breach of the social contract .
however , it is here that important matter will be decided .
how do you envisage democratic debate on this issue ?
we can only achieve that with a stable currency and a stable economy .
what you are recommending to u is nothing new .
ask your staff to show you the document from the last ten year .
we want to get to know your economic model .
there is nothing about any of these thing in your document .
this is also true for the upcoming revision of the multiannual financial framework .
i would also like to address the member state directly .
they all have the potential to create job and growth .
i applaud the huge majority behind the joint resolution .
this is a strong message from parliament that we need action .
you do not get stable public finance by cutting expenditure .
can you tell me what europe 2020 ha to do with all that ?
now where are the job going to come from ?
they are going to come from private investment enterprise and new business start-ups .
it continues to count on the stability and growth pact .
in practice , this mean austerity measure to the detriment of citizen .
it mean extending working life , in other word pension cut .
in this regard , many people talk about limiting debt .
this antisocial policy is not something that my group and i can support .
some 25 million people in the european union are unemployed .
implementing a single railway area is a vital step towards deregulating rail transport .
this can be translated directly into the europe 2020 strategy .
fourthly , we need to have clear support for the energy efficiency policy .
we have to make sure that no one is left behind .
unemployment rate among older people and disabled people are disgracefully high .
now is the time to start delivering on them .
i believe that we should ask ourselves what economic responsibility actually mean .
it is a fact that we have 23 million unemployed in europe .
we have 5.5 million unemployed below the age of 25 .
however , unfortunately , funding is being cut back throughout europe .
there can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy .
how are we going to finance the proposed initiative and action ?
we must understand that we can not focus solely on indicator and figure .
you have given u a lot of fine word .
most job come from economic growth and a healthy private sector .
government do not create job and are not job creator .
the major problem in europe is the lack of competitiveness .
the difference between germany and southern europe is almost 35 % .
what are we actually doing to promote growth and stability ?
it is also crucial in all decision to consult with social partner .
mr morvai , that wa not the spirit of your question .
thus , we need to be more careful in our consideration .
therefore , an instrument like the european semester make sense .
i am talking here about energy , transport and communication .
we also need to consider what resource we can make available to europe .
this includes a clear basis for our own resource .
however , the question of money is crucial here , too .
the impact on the people locally will be disastrous .
sustainable job can only be created if europe stick together .
a divided europe will not be a competitive europe .
we are in agreement with this and we support this .
still , i would advise that some basic principle be laid down .
i agree on the issue of pension and wage .
obviously , a gradual approach will be needed in the future a well .
against this background , we must target three particularly vulnerable group in society .
it ha not been an easy time for europe .
measure to implement the new strategy have been put on the back burner .
firstly , we really need europe a a whole .
we can largely respond to this need through cohesion policy .
i would like to know what the point of that is .
making change to the guideline at this stage could disrupt the process .
let u not give work to those who already have enough of it .
we are waiting for the treaty of lisbon to be applied in full .
the inconvenient truth is that europe is experiencing a recovery .
we are experiencing a very fragile and divided recovery .
the commission ha looked at this situation very thoroughly and developed policy accordingly .
we need to stabilise the euro and economic and monetary union .
we have praised country with a tradition and culture of strong social partnership .
we have also increased the level of social dialogue at european level .
we are pursuing a robust agenda for financial regulation .
a group of commissioner ha been working to develop innovative financial instrument .
in this case i must mention in particular young people .
youth unemployment is very dramatic in some member state .
that is why we designated 2012 the european year for active ageing .
parliament will be involved in the discussion in various way .
i should refer here to the multiannual financial framework negotiation .
only the commission can ensure that there is consistency between these initiative .
none of them must be damaged in this exercise .
the commission is obviously against the concept of a two-speed europe .
one is certainly the implementation and the application of the european semester .
this is the first time , it is the first exercise .
the other element we want to concentrate upon is the six legislative text .
the council want to fully respect the community method .
of course , we always have to be in line with the treaty .
( fr ) you should not put the cart before the horse .
the vote will take place at 12:00 tomorrow , thursday , 17 february .
( fr ) we have taken note of your point .
flexible , affordable access to high-quality training should be a priority .
transport , energy and communication form the backbone of the european economy .
investment in these area will create job and ensure economic and social development .
the argument is that such a move would increase competitiveness and consequently employment .
there is nothing to show that this will automatically be the case .
the europe 2020 strategy is revealing it true agenda .
is the europe 2020 strategy also doomed to failure ?
the eu must also support solution which may seem unconventional at the moment .
such a system would allow u to decouple economic growth from energy consumption .
we have to make sure that smart energy doe not remain a dream .
we are building today a whole new energy infrastructure in europe .
a two-speed europe on energy will not solve energy poverty or inefficiency .
this situation is reflected on the labour market of latgale .
i appeal to the european commission for urgent intervention in the situation .
( for the result of the vote : see minute )
nevertheless , the step we have taken today is still important .
counterfeiting is a crime and must carry specific penalty .
deregulated competition lead to medicine being falsified for the benefit of company .
we could nevertheless have hoped for a more ambitious outcome .
i therefore hope that improvement can be made in the future .
this is a major impediment to job creation and indeed growth .
european pension system are in an increasingly alarming state .
in europe , woman still earn on average 18 % le than men .
a a result , woman are more affected than men by persistent poverty .
the 2020 strategy present a dream future to u .
one motif run through the entire green paper : let old people work .
they use the word 'woman ' only six time .
they use the word 'family ' three time and 'child ' only once .
at the same time , there are only two worker to every pensioner .
nobody talk about the need to have child to improve our pension system .
debate on raising the retirement age are being held in many country .
pension system fall under the competence of the member state .
hopefully it will put the issue of pension centre stage in eu matter .
we are talking about the harmonisation of public sector salary .
we are talking about the full machinery of single eu economic governance .
i am sure you can spot the logical flaw here .
this is being done a a result of the failure of monetary union .
closer integration ha failed to deliver , so let u have more integration .
some are more private-oriented and some are very much state-funded .
we must make sure we have a consistent message .
this unfairness can not , of course , be refinanced via the eu .
today that is difficult and there are flaw in the system .
during that campaign , more than 20 000 innocent victim were slaughtered .
we should actually be learning from our past mistake .
i voted for this report and i congratulate the rapporteur .
the country farthest along in it effort is croatia .
of course , no country is without it fault .
i think there are real loss potentially to croatia .
our parliamentarian are not the owner of our freedom .
i get similar letter from people in cyprus and from property-owners in bulgaria .
it lack the basic infrastructure of a free society .
the croatian medium are subject to censorship and intimidation .
the eu must therefore react swiftly and constructively to the dangerous tendency mentioned .
then eu citizen will feel safe when using genuinely high quality medicine .
figure released by the who and also quoted in european study are alarming .
this is the reason why i voted for this report .
falsified medicine are also increasingly finding their way into the licensed distribution chain .
this pose a major threat to the health of eu citizen .
the european parliament wa right to take thing in hand .
health is the most important asset in everyone 's life .
patient must be absolutely sure that the medicine they take are authentic .
treatment with such falsified medicine can have fatal consequence .
furthermore , there is a trend towards targeting the classical supply chain .
besides the internet , the licensed distribution chain is increasingly targeted .
this focus should not be troubled by other additional objective .
however , the eu must not allow this situation to be reached .
the number of falsified medicinal product is rising sharply in all european country .
i voted in favour of the matias report because :
this is a public health crisis on a global scale .
i welcome this proposal , which aim to curb falsified medical product .
we voted for the matias report on falsified medicine .
is there a desire to eradicate the natural medicine sector ?
not necessarily the health of the people of europe .
the guiding principle should be patient welfare in all case .
more and more innovative and life-saving drug are counterfeit .
the protection of public health against falsified medicine should be the main focus .
i agree with the rapporteur that copyright protection is not a priority here .
the number of falsified medicinal product is rising extremely rapidly in the eu .
they are now being found increasingly in the eu .
around 1 % of medicine sold in europe are estimated counterfeit .
the commission proposal avoids giving specific definition , despite the many recommendation .
particularly useful is the definition of a 'falsified medicinal product ' .
nevertheless , our fellow citizen purchase larger number of these medicine .
president jacques chirac said that the most intolerable inequality is inequality in health .
falsified medicinal product are a scourge that ha long been ignored .
in writing . - i completely support the report of marisa matias .
however , i consider the measure featured in the report to be insufficient .
this objective must be reflected in the directive 's legal basis .
to conclude , this is an important piece of legislation .
in addition , increasing number of innovative and life-saving drug are falsified .
the commission proposal doe not provide the required clarity .
the same applies for other actor , such a transporter or parallel trader .
patient safety ha to be the priority when dealing with medication .
the people distributing them are dangerous criminal and should be viewed a such .
penalty for counterfeiting medicine should be the same a for drug trafficking .
this will require improved coordination between various national and international institution .
the banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premium .
however the european financing scheme is both diverse and complicated .
i would point out the central role of smes in all of this .
the fragmented nature of programme supporting smes is also problematic .
however , only 2 % of them have access to eu funding .
it is also important to progressively correct market failure and remove administrative barrier .
right now , what is needed is an effective change in union policy .
the current financial and economic crisis is exacerbating the problem .
enterprise must have better access to equity-based financial instrument .
they are the workshop which produce innovative idea and original product .
they are also the undertaking that have always driven economic growth .
for the above reason , i voted for this resolution .
smes create more than 70 % of job for lithuanian .
it is therefore important to create an environment in which this can develop .
it is also important to support equity market for start-ups and innovative enterprise .
this will require progressive management and economy linked to innovative financial instrument .
there are currently 100 different pension system in the european union .
due to major difference across the member state , eu citizen feel unequal .
this ha highlighted the fragility of certain financing scheme .
the percentage of people who are retired is rising .
therefore the eu ha a coordinating role to play .
for these reason i abstained from the final vote .
i voted against the report on the green paper on european pension system .
i am aware of the disparity between pension system in europe .
the imco opinion ha largely been reproduced in mr oomen-ruijten 's report .
this will ensure adequate protection of the dutch pillar system .
that is at odds with everything the belgian socialist party stand for .
what is now needed is a series of policy coordinated at eu level .
there are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprise in the eu at present .
a potential market of hundred of billion of euro .
nevertheless , other point have led me to abstain .
we borrow in order to pay today 's pension .
any other solution would mean living beyond our mean .
this draft is certainly too conservative considering what need to be done .
the denial of reality is an act of gross negligence .
it ha a duty to explore coherent and courageous course of action .
the necessary referendum is , unfortunately , a long way off .
i am voting against , and absolutely condemn , this text .
it is therefore urgent to give thought to the future of pension system .
it is necessary to analyse all 27 pension system in the eu .
for all these reason , i voted in favour .
european pension system are in an increasingly alarming state .
in europe , woman still earn on average 18 % le than men .
a a result , woman are more affected than men by persistent poverty .
the european union 's 27 member state have different pension system .
in this respect , we must encourage cooperation between member state .
however , i can not , on balance , support it .
the member state that are making saving should not go about it unthinkingly .
the resolution also pay due attention to the transferability of accrued pension entitlement .
under no circumstance must occupational pension be transferred to a compulsory european system .
life for pensioner in my country is not the easiest .
the time ha come to stop applying double standard .
suddenly they declare that the crisis is not yet over .
genuine sustainability can not be achieved without ensuring that pension are adequate .
ageing society and financial pressure show that our labour market is changing .
it is necessary to take this into account when reforming pension system .
i am against any regulation of pension at a european level .
pension system are structured differently in the various member state .
one of the issue mentioned in the document is war crime trial .
further development of it infrastructure could provide enormous potential to the country .
i am confident that this deadline will be met .
the people of croatia have great expectation of this membership .
croatia clearly ha a place in the european union .
further enlargement can not be achieved without additional fund for the union .
i hope that croatia will continue further along this positive route .
i am voting against this motion for a resolution and it antisocial injunction .
negotiation with croatia on it accession to the eu may be concluded shortly .
however , the necessary reform need to be pursued with determination .
i therefore fully support the 2010 progress report on croatia .
this ha also been described in detail in the resolution .
however , the report is , by and large , acceptable .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
following these benchmark , i voted for this resolution .
eu membership will in any case be subject to a referendum .
the vast majority of case remain stuck at the investigation stage .
this is remarkably often the case where senior official are under investigation .
we must learn from our experience with bulgaria and romania .
for this reason , we voted in favour of this resolution .
corruption and judicial reform have not been properly addressed .
i will ask you to come forward for the signing of the procedure .
you can be proud of the work done for our citizen .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is the council and commission statement on rising food price .
family in the poorest region of the world are in difficulty .
so what can the european union do to address this problem ?
this is highly relevant with regard to global food security .
let me now come back to the issue of financial speculation .
i am sure we can count on your support in all our effort .
let u begin with the situation on the world 's agricultural market .
current harvest in the southern hemisphere are larger than expected .
however , there is a lesson to be drawn from all this .
this is a major challenge for the commission a a whole .
let me turn , finally , to the role of trade .
it is now high time that our policy assisted that agriculture .
i would first like to make the following observation .
too much food wa thought to be the problem .
that model can not meet the challenge we face in the future .
we need to act now and build a new agricultural model .
we are only at 3 % of the 2008 level .
this is a first step towards countering the appetite of the speculator .
they are no longer able to feed their animal .
the commission is demanding that farmer adapt to market signal .
it would do well , today , to follow it own advice .
the crisis must be confronted and i propose three concrete action .
secondly , the indexation of meat price paid to farmer to fodder price .
i would just like to take u back a little bit .
i have been a member of this parliament since 1989 .
hopefully we can find a way to do that .
so far only usd 925 million ha been paid .
either way , retail food price can only go higher .
well , it is making it unnecessarily expensive to import non-gm soya bean .
what would we be paying for food in that financial climate ?
i believe that , with regard to speculation , moderation is required .
there is a real risk of a global food crisis .
food security is our north star and this is an eu success story .
i do not believe that free trade is the answer .
our common agricultural policy must also revert to a system ...
point ( d ) draw attention to the phenomenon of speculation .
this underline the dreadful consequence for those suffering country .
we must learn how to cooperate with other country such a thailand .
we must ensure a quick transition to stability in north africa .
it is up to the commission and the council to translate it .
that is about the size of that part of the chamber over there .
the european union wa self-sufficient in food until recently .
it is actually taking food away from the poorest people 's mouth .
we can do it if we have the will .
the developing country also need greater support from u to develop their agriculture .
on the contrary , they represent the solution to the problem .
adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity .
this will have two important consequence on european government .
we need to invest in the common agricultural policy .
the first concern the need to plan medium- and long-term action .
why is the food market in the situation it is in ?
let u remember 2008 and the situation the food market wa in .
maybe our colleague should come here today and listen .
we ask why there are no reserve but we are limiting agricultural trend .
the problem of food security is becoming a global problem .
we must now give political attention to this whole situation .
we must consider how we can produce food and make it available .
we need to make the land that we have productive .
for year we have complained that food price are too low .
( de ) madam president , food price have reached new record high .
the volatility of food price ha increased in recent year for various reason .
there is , therefore , great cause for concern .
the result wa that sugar price did not fall , they simply increased .
this should be a lesson for all of u .
the current food price increase can be blamed partly on the poor harvest .
nor is it the intention of the commission to set land aside .
the vote will take place on thursday , 17 february 2011 .
global food security is a crucial issue for the european union .
currently 30 % of the food produced in the world is wasted .
this is unacceptable , immoral wastage and must be curbed .
from our point of view the social consequence are more significant .
their despair creates a source of increasing political tension .
we must be ready to face a potential crisis .
based on forecast of diminishing supply , importer drive up price .
poverty is an issue within european border , too .
nevertheless , our voter too are becoming aware of increasing food price .
therefore we can not leave everyday foodstuff to self-regulation .
his departure ha opened the way to the possible transformation of egypt .
there are already report on the first step taken .
it is not for u to dictate outcome or impose solution .
the future lie firmly in the hand of the people of egypt .
the most important thing is : to consolidate democracy .
this could also be extended to the entire eu .
her action must be supported by all of u .
these are question not of million , commissioner , but of billion .
thirdly , commissioner , this is not the end .
today everyone say that mr mubarak wa a dictator .
i did not hear that a month ago in the european parliament .
what did we do when a tsunami claimed score of victim ?
we mobilised exceptional fund precisely to help the people affected .
there are only men , even though woman took part in the demonstration .
i do not think that this is the right solution .
i do not think that this is the right signal to send out .
mr president , this debate is about how we helped egypt .
the revolution in tunisia and egypt have something in common .
however , our neighbourhood policy ha been lacking in credibility .
this is what need to be changed , mr füle .
real stability will only come about if we support freedom .
i hope that we are on the right track here .
it also mean freezing the asset of those who have misused state fund .
it is not a european revolution that we would be able to steer .
i would like to say a few word about adaptation of the instrument .
that is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it mean .
the threat that power may be seized by extremist element still exists .
'allah akbar ' wa a slogan which wa often heard during the protest .
i call on our member not to be naïve today .
the new egyptian constitution must not be given over to sharia .
the dutch party for freedom ha the gut to say that out loud .
do parliament and the european commission have the gut to say that today ?
the message of egypt is a message for the whole arab world .
this message is not only for the arab world .
this is precisely the role of the european parliament .
i hope that the european union will play it part in that .
do you not think that this picture is catastrophic , and wrong ?
we hope that this will be a transition to democracy .
we are talking about egypt , but this process is spreading .
i therefore welcome baroness ashton 's visit to cairo next week .
that is the message that we are being sent .
what can it do and what must it do ?
certainly not what is ha being doing to date .
it ha basically been absent , with no cohesion and no reflex .
development in our wider neighbourhood are becoming a yardstick for european foreign policy .
what can europe do , a the previous speaker said ?
we should now support this transformation , a other speaker have said .
there is room here for the european union to provide assistance .
this is possibly more important than funding and other matter .
this question remains undecided and the european union can provide assistance here .
( sk ) thank you very much for the question .
people will exercise their right to free medium and freedom of expression .
finally , we need a complete revision of our policy on the mediterranean .
every other word from u wa simply about 'maintaining stability ' .
we german in particular know what we are talking about .
what we had in egypt wa not stability ; it wa oppression .
freedom and stability can go hand in hand any time .
therefore , we should not dictate to the egyptian who they should elect .
why do we never say anything to encourage them ?
they had money and a few shrewd people socked it away .
this house ha an important role to play to play in that .
the egyptian authority made plan to have their country 's constitution revised .
the next item is the commission statement on medium law in hungary .
the amendment agreed would limit the prohibition to discriminatory treatment .
we will continue to monitor the situation , but that is quite clear .
the commission doe not shy away from using it power .
i am of course grateful to the commissioner for her work .
first of all , i have to ask you about the timing .
please let u know those concession have been secured .
we need answer on where we go on this crucial issue .
obviously we commend the hungarian authority 's willingness to amend the legislation .
democracy are built upon the principle of a free and independent medium .
that is taking place in an already highly polarised political environment .
why ha the commission not objected to this lack of independence ?
mr president , freedom of speech is of great value .
let u discus actual violation , those that have already occurred .
we are concerned with protecting the freedom of the medium .
what is the point of the resolution tomorrow , if not political instrumentalisation ?
once it ha been completed , we should respect it .
today , i feel that we have also undermined our own institution .
this is the reason that brings u here today .
so the question is , will this authority be reviewed ?
for instance , by reviewing the monitoring authority , a i said before .
however , that is something that remains to be seen .
that is , i think , a touch pathetic .
of course , i hope that the commissioner will indeed do that .
mr orbán wa not involved in this at the beginning .
that is not compatible with the legislation at eu level .
therefore , this really is not a democratic medium law .
mr kroes , you did not go far enough in my view .
yet this give europe reason for hope , not reason for criticism .
i am therefore grateful to the commission and to the hungarian government .
now the commission is forcing the orbán government to amend the scandalous law .
the eu 's criticism mark a political defeat for the hungarian right wing .
dear colleague , what i said before may have caused some confusion .
there will be no more blue card question in this debate .
( interjection from mr morvai : 'shame on you ! ' )
to quote a hungarian socialist classic : 'fiddlesticks ! '
this is not at all the case here , my fellow member .
in my opinion , we definitely need to put a stop to that .
i give them on the basis of who raised their blue card first .
the medium also have a very special responsibility in our society .
however , still you insist on continuing this now meaningless debate .
to me , lady and gentleman , this represents an outrageous double standard .
this includes a rearrangement of the framework of journalist ethic and medium culture .
consequently i am pleased this evening , but i am vigilant .
this needed to be done and you did well to address this matter .
dear furious fellow member , you have been deliberately misled .
i do not know whether this law wa passed with good intention .
having said that , the background to today 's outcome is fascinating .
firstly , we are not talking about this issue for the first time .
secondly , we are talking about a very important issue .
the third issue is , of course , the hungarian presidency .
so that will be the text after the change .
the hungarian minister 's body language is also saying yes .
i make particular reference to the comment made by the osce medium representative .
a i said already before , the law would have been adopted .
now i believe that we are hopefully over that .
paradoxically , the directive doe not give the commission much room for manoeuvre .
free trade agreement between the eu and the republic of korea ( debate )
the south korea market offer significant new opportunity for eu good and service .
the fta fully liberalises nearly all the eu 's agricultural export .
export are thus an important source of growth for the eu .
i have always said that trade is the real mean of development .
by removing barrier to trade and building new bridge we create new opportunity .
at this stage i would like to thank ignacio from the commission .
i urge all group to put aside protectionism and support this agreement .
indeed , it may well be the case that liberalisation fuel liberalisation .
monitoring of sensitive sector shall include car , textile and consumer electronics .
the commission will be closely monitoring the implementation of this provision .
both the european and the korean economy will benefit considerably .
that could lead to the creation of new job .
thus , we set out to achieve two objective .
i believe that here today , we can say 'mission accomplished ' .
this is all thanks to parliament 's hard work and expertise .
today , concern on the free trade agreement with korea have hugely diminished .
indeed , we might say that they have all but vanished .
today , the opportunity this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainty .
the european parliament should be proud of a job well done .
in that respect , we have gained a new responsibility .
we have proven that very clearly in this matter .
the aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goal .
we therefore need to ass this agreement from this viewpoint .
section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business .
this make an important area of policy - trade policy - more democratic .
we , a parliament , consider this to be important .
that is why our group will vote against this agreement .
my group and i have justified doubt about this prediction .
what are the efficiency criterion and what are the free trade criterion ?
most of u will agree that this is a win-win situation .
it will be particularly beneficial for europe 's farmer and economic operator .
i must say that it look good at first glance .
worse still , who will ultimately be footing this bill ?
these rule have no place in a free trade agreement .
what a great idea , but please let u drop this safeguard clause .
i would emphasise that we need it to be a win-win situation .
there is a new generation coming up , which is a good thing .
the trade agreement is , to my mind , mutually beneficial .
however , there are also fundamental reason for this .
mr president , a free trade agreement can not only be about tariff .
it also ha to be about intellectual property right .
trade offer a way out of the economic crisis .
however , free trade must not be allowed to lead to freebooting .
the debate among my shadow rapporteur ha been phenomenal .
we have had extremely good input from virtually everybody .
there have been a number of issue raised today .
i only pick on that because i am involved in agriculture .
a i said , the quality of the debate ha been excellent .
we live in a global market , whether we like it or not .
there are problem with that but it is a fact .
however , they will not be a easy a this one .
it ha been excellent and it show how comprehensive this house can be .
at the same time , this is an ambitious and innovative agreement .
the next item is question time ( b7-0009/2011 ) .
this act should be a veritable magna carta for smes .
this is really very important for the existence and working condition of smes .
the aim is to lend more money on these issue later on .
subject : initiative on the management of water and drinking water
the second topic is the role of ecological service provided by water .
do all the member state concerned intend to draw up action plan ?
mr papanikolaou mentioned the problem of the island in the aegean sea .
mr ticau and mr rubiks both asked their question about the danube strategy .
if you will allow me , i would like to answer them together .
the eu institution and member state are to implement this strategy together .
( hu ) minister , thank you very much for your answer .
we , too , are planning to make progress , of course .
i have to say that this is very difficult .
member state often refer to financial issue and financial difficulty .
thank you very much for the effort you have made .
situation in egypt ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
parliament ha discussed the issue very thoroughly over several month .
i would like to draw attention to two shortcoming at this stage .
one of the major barrier is access to financial service .
public bank have an irreplaceable role to play here .
with this legislative resolution , the eib is therefore taking an essential step .
tax haven should not be given any chance in these project .
i really think they have achieved an excellent result .
i really do call on everyone to support these demand .
in this context , i would like to mention two detail .
i think that is a good basis for our negotiation with the council .
the commission must now submit a report every year .
this is taxpayer ' money . we need to spend it carefully .
that is actually how this question should be put .
when it come down to it , what are the criterion ?
this report fails to demand disclosure by those intermediary bank .
not one of these country is exactly a shining example of democracy .
the solution for this is that these project require much better preparation .
doe the state respect the property of it citizen ?
we debated the instrument and what we could do .
it is also a good example of how this parliament can react quickly .
the same is now required of the council , which must act accordingly .
if these were to become due , we would have a problem .
first , i would like to underline the importance of following the timetable .
so i would underline that this is an extremely important issue .
the egyptian portfolio is one of the largest in the eib .
it is part of bank ' culture that they are evaluated by rating .
so there are democratic mechanism and the bank must operate within this framework .
rapporteur . - mr president , i have just three point .
first , the european investment bank is a european institution .
second , the european investment bank is a financial institution which is top-rated .
the decision is about the renewal of the guarantee 's mandate .
commission expert group and balanced representation and transparency ( debate )
all civil society organisation are facing a huge lack of resource .
that applies to the union , consumer organisation and to representative of smes .
we need to instil confidence in the expert working group .
you will notice that mr macovei is in the chamber .
she ha a great history of challenging for greater openness and transparency .
i would like to know why parliament wa not consulted .
a you know , brussels is the international lobbying capital , before washington .
i am a member of the committee on economic and monetary affair .
you have , for example , a group of banking expert .
why were we not involved earlier in the reform that you have introduced ?
i should like , commissioner , to emphasise two point .
the second question concern the selection of external expert .
i think that the issue of conflict of interest is crucial .
thus , some of the data still need to be validated .
the transition need to be completed over the next few month .
i am glad that i am speaking after him .
we would rather see bigger step being taken towards transparency .
a the commissioner mentioned , we have a revised framework .
there is a risk of 'corporate capture ' of expert group .
this is something that we need to work on urgently .
the issue of expert doe not only concern the economy .
this is evidenced by the speech of it director in this parliament .
we are aware that this is an extremely problematic aspect .
some group have more representative of the finance industry than responsible official .
such ridiculous platitude are hardly conducive to creating transparency and neutrality .
but you should never regard the expert a some kind of decision-makers .
they are not decision-makers and they clash with each other .
yes , i am in favour of greater transparency .
there is also the question of the composition of the expert group .
who should ass whether their composition is balanced or not ?
the composition of the expert group is determined by specific case .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.45 and resumed at 12.00 )
bilateral safeguard clause in the eu-korea free trade agreement (
free trade agreement between the eu and the republic of korea (
this is a ground-breaking free trade agreement , which is outstanding .
implementation of the eu strategy for the danube region ( vote )
i will read the text out in english - new paragraph 10 a :
implementation of the guideline for the employment policy of the member state (
guideline for the employment policy of the member state (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
who wish to speak in favour ? who wish to speak against ?
all these reason have led u to vote against this agreement .
therefore , i am very pleased that it wa accepted .
we will see better and better opportunity for exporting .
many people from poland go on holiday to egypt on a regular basis .
we have yet to complete the real major task .
egypt is still mired in backwardness , anti-semitism and extreme practice .
this prof that we should be well prepared , and stand our ground .
it is stability that ha been important for the eu .
that ha nothing whatsoever to do with the rule of law .
this call for an integrated response from the international community .
the resolution approved today is a first step in the right direction .
however , we need to go ahead with further proposal .
therefore , attention should be paid to this aspect of common policy .
( fi ) mr president , this is an extremely important issue .
right now , there are a billion starving people in the world .
in 2008 , rising food price caused riot in 30 country .
food price are rising , but farmer ' profit are falling .
this , too , should be stressed very strongly .
my opinion and my vote on the latter are positive .
in short , the eib can contribute effectively to eu development cooperation objective .
it is not enough that only the eib know who get these monies .
this applies to all eu institution , including the eib .
it will generate immediate , substantial saving in several economic sector .
on the other hand , i voted against the agreement itself .
this open up new export opportunity for our domestic farmer .
this dramatically change the long-standing trade rule between the eu and korea .
in this context , there are part that could be interpreted ambiguously .
i welcome the fact that the agreement pay significant attention to sustainable development .
the people of egypt are seeing their legitimate expectation met .
i condemn the violence and disproportionate force used against the protester .
according to data in my possession , radical islamist are behind this destabilisation .
i am decidedly against chaos in the arab world .
i am opposed to financial aid for any kind of extremism or disorder .
the iraq war and the dual power situation in pakistan are enough .
we must be considered and pragmatic when it come to islamic country .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
we must , today , take action to mitigate these effect .
mistake , unfortunately , have to be put right .
the next few month will be decisive for egypt .
support for free and democratic election should be a priority .
for the next few year , we should be guided by one objective .
these fund will provide direct support to the strategy 's implementation .
the danube region is an important focal point for eu cohesion policy programme .
the strategy should not be a reason for setting up new institution .
it main purpose should be to strengthen coordination between the individual regional player .
for this reason , the strategy should not be allocated any specific fund .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
i therefore express my sincerest condolence to the victim .
in truth , these standard are being ignored and crudely infringed .
the interest of france were more important than a common foreign policy .
we should do this more often , and with more country .
why do critic automatically assume that the evidence ha been falsified ?
russia ha two main problem associated with the rule of law .
economic growth will not allow for the rule of law .
we remain too dependent on fossil fuel instead of exploring alternative energy source .
the european commission and the council must make a major contribution here .
europe must take collective action to overcome the current situation .
that is why i am voting for this resolution .
i voted against the motion for a resolution on the europe 2020 strategy .
we therefore voted against this motion for a resolution .
another very important question is the reduction of poverty among woman .
the objective of the strategy can be achieved principally by education and training .
no member state should or can effectively tackle global challenge by acting alone .
these are the reason why i voted for this resolution .
european parliament involvement in these policy must not be neglected .
i would like to express my concern at the current employment situation .
i would argue that unemployment is the real social problem of today .
for all these reason , we voted against this report .
those who stay can not find work outside of agriculture .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
this report endorses the harmful employment guideline of the commission and the council .
unemployment is a major problem and a difficult one to solve .
on the income side there is no production and no tax is collected .
in 2010 , agricultural produce generated the biggest gain on the stock exchange .
however , there are also cause which we can and need to control .
furthermore , whole sector of the agricultural industry are under threat .
i see this situation in my own country , romania .
stopping speculation is absolutely crucial , a is combating climate change .
i abstained from the vote on rising food price .
that is why we have voted in favour of this resolution .
the claim of direct threat to europe 's food supply are grossly exaggerated .
the problem of speculation is touched on , but very inadequately .
access to these market should be reserved for professional buyer only .
however , the main problem remains the need to increase world agricultural productivity .
only access to more efficient agriculture will enable u to conquer hunger .
the number of farmer growing gmos is increasing every year .
however , the high price are also a problem within the eu .
higher consumer price are not reflected in farming income .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution on rising food price .
effective , coordinated step must be taken to solve these problem .
it is not enough to establish the single fact that foodstuff are expensive .
that would enable u to define the true cost and avoid destabilisation .
moreover , the food crisis also applies to europe .
clearly europe need to produce more today , using fewer resource more efficiently .
these are all measure that make for strong and sustainable european agriculture .
the commission must quickly make proposal along these line .
this advance is a first step towards denying the speculator what they crave .
the impact on european livestock farmer is dramatic and immediate , too .
five year ago , wheat wa worth eur 100 per tonne .
the commission is demanding that farmer adapt to market signal .
it would do well today to follow it own advice .
the right to food is a basic and fundamental human right .
the text before u rightly emphasis the need for a multidimensional approach .
europe ha a vital role to play in guaranteeing global food security .
the riot that have taken place in developing country are example of this .
support for at-risk country should be reinforced to prevent future food crisis .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
these cluster munition wreak havoc on civilian that continues long after their launch .
we call on thailand and cambodia to stop using these terrible weapon immediately .
particularly worrying is the reported use of cluster munition .
such bellicose and incendiary rhetoric can only make matter worse .
today , the european parliament ha joined the appeal .
otherwise there is an imminent danger of growing nationalism a well a xenophobia .
it is good that the european parliament is intervening in this matter .
the destruction of the world 's cultural heritage must not go unpunished .
killing people and endangering people 's life is never a solution .
a border conflict is always a source of instability .
it relates to freedom of expression , fundamentally on the internet .
mr president , unfortunately this dispute is over a century old .
if these happen , then this dispute can be brought to an end .
the issue is not only about a world heritage site .
most importantly , the issue is about human life and about regional stability .
the indonesian foreign minister ha rightly invoked the treaty of amity and cooperation .
this agreement requires all party to settle their difference by peaceful mean .
for the eu , this implies giving full support to asean .
the vote will take place at the end of the final debate .
men and woman there are fighting for their freedom .
violence is erupting between supporter and opponent of the regime .
even before a crime ha been committed , the victim are child .
both convention prohibit the execution of people under the age of 18 .
on monday , amnesty international reported on the action of yemeni security force .
this really is a question of a truly united fight .
even the particular of the crime can not be made out satisfactorily .
it is possible that he wa not a minor .
turning this practice into a habit is a crime in itself .
this case is a sad example of what is going on in yemen .
we call on the authority to refrain from carrying out these punishment .
sharia court are imposing capital punishment on youth in somalia , for example .
at any rate , they tend to get thing moving much faster .
the capital punishment of juvenile offender ha always taken place in yemen .
the issue of muhammed taher thabet samoum wa taken up again last week .
the government of yemen ha shown receptiveness to our démarches .
the vote will take place at the end of the final debate .
the case of muhammed taher thabet samoum is not the only one .
a is known , the death sentence doe not reduce crime .
this wave of resistance also spread to yemen last week .
since david kato 's murder , the authority have been too silent .
tomorrow , presidential election will take place in uganda .
the case of david kato is an example of that .
the editor said that the persecution of homosexual and their execution should continue .
sure enough , david kato wa murdered , on 26 january .
we also call on uganda to revise it legislation .
the european union actively support democratic change in africa .
i would just like to make one final point .
mr president , hatred and human right violation against sexual minority continue worldwide .
the language of hatred is also in use here in the european union .
in fact , on these internet site violence is openly incited against minority .
david kato wa a courageous human right defender and fearless lgtb right activist .
a a leading voice on lgtb right , his life wa under threat .
it wa a success that he won an appeal against the paper .
the eu position on lgtb right is very clear .

innovative financing at a global and european level ( debate )
are we going to hide behind the lack of global agreement ?
this will enable the commission to make appropriate proposal on policy action .
a proposal for revision of the etd is planned for spring 2011 .
i hear also your concern a regard the potential risk of carbon leakage .
that will be the result of agreeing with mr gauzès .
mr president , i wish to thank mr podimata for her constructive cooperation .
we have managed to reach a compromise despite major difference of opinion .
i would like to address my comment to mr bullmann , in particular .
this , of course , provides the basis for europe 's growth .
mr president , why are we discussing innovative financing ?
have we gone tax mad all of a sudden ?
a you know , we must rebuild public finance on sustainable foundation .
individual effort by member state are no longer effective .
that is what is being referred to a a competitiveness pact .
it is bank and financial institution which will pay these new european tax .
the income side of public financing ha been completely disregarded to date .
it is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budget .
the state are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis .
i am sorry , but we are living in a global economy .
to do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics .
( de ) mr president , you are wrong , mr farage .
yes - we need the european union precisely for such matter .
the european parliament can prove itself here , too .
a tax rate of 0.03 % or 0.05 % is not sufficient .
i will certainly be voting in favour of amendment 2 tomorrow .
i would like to raise three issue regarding the tax on financial transaction .
secondly , do we need a tax on financial transaction ?
in my opinion , it is an extremely interesting avenue to explore .
i would like to know what is meant by 'global ' .
she ha not had an easy job in recent week .
at a global level , there is scarcely anyone who opposes this tax .
there is no technical reason not to do so .
it seems it preference would be for a financial transaction tax .
it is estimated that this would generate eur 200 billion per annum .
unfortunately , however , this report take u in precisely that direction .
fiscal sovereignty must remain the responsibility of the member state .
there are a series of question that i would ask here .
to be completely honest , i do not know of any .
it seems clear to me that that is the case .
however , they have all been little more than formal statement .
the financial transaction tax would provide a potent new source of development funding .
in this context , we can also discus how innovative we are being .
nevertheless , i can understand that some people may think they are necessary .
we must also remember that these tax actually have to work in practice .
in the uk , a group ha been formed to support the ftt .
i support it campaign , and i urge parliament to do likewise .
with the tax on those , the price is increased for the customer .
so , the tax will be directed at customer .
that might be good because , of course , we need tax .
i believe we should follow the epp line on this issue .
i am disappointed that you have already taken that decision .
unemployment is today 's real social problem ; this is our task today .
it also say that there would be a flight of capital from europe .
my answer to that is : so what if there is ?
implementing this tax solely in europe would help deflate the bubble .
they would have a much greater incentive to finance the real economy .
it must lead the way in reforming our financial system .
what we need to know is what the outcome will be .
we therefore consider it necessary to establish clear rule to prevent this situation .
if we listen to mr podimata , thing are actually quite simple .
we take the money where we find it , and that is that .
prevaricating would be the most dangerous thing that parliament could do .
with regard to eurobonds , there are three category .
thirdly and finally , yes , we need these eurobonds for investment .
a continent which doe not invest is a continent which will decline .
therefore , we need these eurobonds , these project bond .
the report ha , in fact , turned out rather well .
in poland , we did not supplement the financial system .
it seems that this system did not generate debt .
this report contains both helpful and also problematic initiative .
they would entail a 'moral hazard ' , a they say .
it is a subject that concern the whole of parliament .
mr president , i should like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
regarding eurobonds , again , there are possibility here for major infrastructure project .
however , i would like to draw attention to two particularly important matter .
such a tax should not have a negative impact on the banking system .
the cure it suggests includes a financial transaction tax .
i wa pleased to co-sign amendment 3 , calling for a feasibility study .
once that feasibility study is available , we can then make a decision .
this tax will contribute to improved control of the financial sector .
in other word , it is a step in the right direction .
a you know , financial transaction are easily relocated outside the eu .
this wa very clearly illustrated by mr schmidt and mr hökmark .
i can assure you that this impact assessment will be conducted very thoroughly .
some of you raised the question of who will pay the tax .
we have committed ourselves to doing this by the summer break .
first issue : a global or a european tax ?
we must make sure that we do not get overtaken by event .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march 2011 .
remarkably , no vat is levied on most financial service .
the main cost of the crisis have so far been borne by taxpayer .
this discussion is fascinating on an ethical , political and even technical level .
general fishery commission for the mediterranean agreement area ( debate )
we have to do this because the mediterranean really need it .
so we will go through this exercise again and again .
i am afraid that this will not be possible through this procedure .
i therefore regret that the institution can not agree on this important question .
needle to say , i am delighted by this measure .
this is what you just spoke about , commissioner .
in 2006 , the commission tried to rectify the problem of the mediterranean .
it wa a very sensible measure and we are extremely grateful to you .
it is quite clear that the mediterranean need regulation .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 8 march 2011 ) .
this will avoid any temptation to pay for 'paper fish ' .
we will do our best in order to achieve the best result .
let me tell you a little about the current fishery agreement with mauritania .
this agreement aim to ensure the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fishery stock .
the ca will become operational during the first semester of 2011 .
we hope that the council will adopt this new mandate next week .
however , there are still several problem relating to this agreement .
we need to change a great deal in our fishery agreement .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for her introduction .
the fishing sector in mauritania remains at a very incipient level of development .
in this context , the fishery agreement with mauritania take on particular importance .
codecision occurs when this process is cultivated a the process develops .
i believe the agreement with mauritania is a good instrument .
another aspect that need to be guaranteed is the security of the vessel .
currently , eu contribution account for a third of mauritania 's national budget .
we therefore need to pay particular attention to this .
if we can do thing better , i am here to cooperate .
they deserve all the procedure and all the improvement this country need .
so this is how we are approaching this very sensitive issue .
the vote will take place at the next part-session .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
a transfer of funding requires the consent of all the commissioner .
i will spare you the description of this torture .
suffice it to say that it wa very serious .
within hour , this song became an anthem in my country .
killing dog is also a lucrative business for the mafia .
help prevent romania from being transformed into idi amin 's uganda .
we face , for example , ongoing violation of human right .
however , this decision by moody 's is absolutely unjustified .
a failure will cause the union a serious problem .
it continues to support project in the economically disadvantaged region .
therefore , from the legal standpoint , we are clearly against this decision .
many people have been extradited where there is no real evidence against them .
our position must therefore be principled and founded on value .
general product safety and market surveillance ( short presentation )
we chose to divide our report into two part .
the directive is still sound , but there is a need for improvement .
there is an increasing number of product coming onto the internal market .
we need to ensure that they actually comply with our internal market rule .
we can see that there are problem in this area .
however , this did not receive support in the internal market committee .
we believe that there is a need to strengthen market surveillance .
i hope that the new rapex system will help remedy this .
i mentioned this in a question to the commission .
moreover , the toy safety directive still doe not ban carcinogenic product .
many product today contain chemical that are already prohibited within the eu .
we need a clear and effective market surveillance framework .
we need a framework that ensures a working internal market in safe good .
clearer product safety obligation of economic operator will therefore be established .
i wish to thank parliament again for this very good resolution .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
indeed , the who ha informed u that it ha this in hand .
finland ha suspended the use of this vaccine until more information is available .
i would like to see the commission adopt the same position a finland .
it is a good report therefore , and i congratulate the rapporteur .
there are many point in this report that are of questionable value .
what we got wa a report that wa more political than practical .
however , the who and the ecdc have maintained a stubborn silence .
no reassessment of the situation , no additional recommendation , simply nothing ...
we need to look more closely at the implementation itself .
i would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate .
the handling of the h1n1 situation ha shown that there are shortcoming here .
the eu already had in place independent capacity and expertise on pandemic influenza .
these challenge will be addressed by u under two initiative .
this would also reinforce our purchasing power to obtain better contractual term .
the commission welcome the support expressed by the rapporteur for such initiative .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
after all , the wolf may actually appear one day .
we must not rely solely on study of expert funded by pharmaceutical company .
the virus proved to be much le dangerous than ordinary flu .
health inequality vary from country to country and from region to region .
the current situation of global crisis tends to make the situation worse .
a we have been seeing , unequal society are unstable society .
i consider it essential to guarantee child and pregnant woman good health condition .
point 26 , 29 and 53 are also contentious .
but it doe not seem to be able to lead by example .
come on , if you are going to have equality ...
this is because people are equal in sickness and suffering .
mr president , there are a number of aspect here .
i look forward to the european commission 's proposal on that .
this is why the health factor must feature in all eu policy .
i would like to be sincere on this issue .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
they must all be guaranteed the right to health and the necessary care .
there are major difference between healthcare system both inside and between member state .
i hope that it will find confirmation during tomorrow 's vote .
effective taxation system not only provide funding for vital public service .
it is also a vital step towards restoring the european union 's credibility .
this in turn help increase the inequitable distribution of tax revenue .
another measure involves increasing the exchange of information between all member state .
so we must work simultaneously at two complementary level .
concrete action ha been made possible by the parliament 's financial support .
we will also provide technical assistance to implement tax information exchange agreement .
this could help developing country to combat tax evasion more effectively .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
to conclude , agriculture is not simply an economic activity .
consequently , the principal challenge consists of effectively accommodating trade and non-trade concern .
that is why the word in this report are strong .
also , may i add a few word about climate change consistency .
certainly , the proposal regarding mercosur are not acceptable .
this is our conscious choice in order to protect our consumer .
if we make a mistake , however , we must undo it .
overall , it is important to maintain a coherent message .
i agree that we have to invest in that card .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
we have a huge protein deficit in the european union .
that is the reason why our market ha been flooded with cheap soya .
in germany , the figure is just 1 % .
growing leguminous plant is very important for binding co2 .
it can minimise import or the use of mineral nitrogen .
europe ha moved into second place worldwide where import are concerned .
there are two particular issue that i want to draw attention to .
mr president , i want to thank the rapporteur for the report .
protein supply is most important for the livestock sector and it profitability .
we urgently need to redevelop these crop in our region .
this policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policy .
there is not a single indication for this ban to prevail for non-ruminant ...
soya is genetically modified , so it production is relatively cheap .
the rapporteur say two very important thing - one is crop rotation .
production of rapeseed meal and ethanol co-products ha risen sharply .
so i welcome your support for enhancing the environmental sustainability of arable farming .
they can also help through the development of new plant variety .
crop rotation or incentive through research and rural development policy can help .
but the eu will remain dependent on imported protein .
the vote will take place at midday on tuesday , 8 march .
this would also allow import of high-protein feed from america to be reduced .
any kind of food dependency put the eu in a very vulnerable position .
i declare the 2010-2011 session of the european parliament adjourned .
i hereby declare the 2011-2012 session of the european parliament resumed .
today , 8 march , is international woman 's day .
guideline for the 2012 budget - other section ( debate )
in order to achieve this , we will need the necessary resource .
we have new power resulting from the treaty of lisbon .
these principle will have to translate to budgetary rigour , simplicity and transparency .
in this way , we will manage to keep up with our responsibility .
the same principle should be applied a regard future enlargement .
the european budget is mainly about investment and not consumption and social transfer .
i particularly welcome his proposal to keep increase within the rate of inflation .
i believe the initial proposal of 5.2 % is far too high .
i should like to reply to mr hohlmeier 's comment .
madam president , thank you mr fernandes for this excellent report .
it must make sense and must be reasonable in term of the future .
mr fernandes us word like consolidation , containment and self-restraint .
however , i believe that the project must have clear business plan .
one particular point of concern to my group is security .
having a professional security service enables that to happen .
at present , the market would not seem to support this .
which brings me to the issue of the house of european history .
it must also apply to the court of auditor .
we will include croatia 's accession in an amending budget .
many people have also mentioned the question of the house of european history .
the european parliament must therefore adapt it budget strategy to this fact .
we must strive for maximum budgetary discipline and austerity .
a further criticism need to be levelled at the european external action service .
what we are doing at present is actually spending even more .
the voter ' question and comment are absolutely spot-on .
we , a the european union , should be setting an example .
we can make saving if we stop travelling between three place of work .
concerning the building policy , the text explicitly mention the principle of centralisation .
in such case , these fund should not be used up in full .
only those who work particularly hard could use up the entire allowance .
everyone else should return this money to the taxpayer .
it is a fact that the european budget ha been shrinking for decade .
at the same time , though , national european budget have increased significantly .
madam president , i would thank all my fellow member for their contribution .
i am well aware that we have new power .
the vote will take place at 11:30 on wednesday , 9 march 2011 .
female poverty - equality between woman and men - 2010 ( debate )
never before ha this figure been so high in the european parliament .
the present economic crisis ha made u face our own contradiction .
only 3 % of board member of publicly listed company are woman .
finally , madam president , i should like to raise one last point .
woman are expecting u to provide concrete proposal , concrete measure .
the third issue is related to reconciliation between private and professional life .
seventh , we should not ignore violence against woman .
parliament 's report show very clearly what the gap are .
the second element is woman in the world of employment .
only from 5 march on did we start to be paid .
the political commitment of the european commission is contained in our new strategy .
providing the funding to meet those challenge is also crucial .
it pay special attention to woman and young people .
let u do our utmost to make sure it achieves it aim .
this is one task we should all adopt for ourselves .
this is revealed not only by the earnings gap between men and woman .
there are many reason why poverty is a female issue .
let u start with the employment sector and the gender pay gap .
too many woman remain in a position of relative economic insecurity and dependence .
the ageing population could provide an ideal opportunity for gender equality .
in this spirit , we have supported some of the amendment proposal .
i think we should also remember these woman today .
we can not afford to do without woman on the labour market .
i can compare the use of quota with antibiotic .
parental insurance is good for equality on the labour market .
woman can also contribute to prosperity in the eu .
speak to any small businessman you like in my country .
it is having 52 week of poorly paid maternity leave .
only there are a lot of people who keep quiet .
i do not accept that somebody take responsibility for his neighbour 's child .
let me remind you that 2010 wa the year for combating poverty .
it is a shame that mr bloom ha already left .
is it just the merit of woman that is being questioned ?
is it the case that men do not have merit ?
there is a bogeyman in this subject , and this bogeyman is quota .
lucky that you remembered to do this before the day had actually passed .
we have no more time for meaningless press release .
we do not want to hear nice word from you .
perhaps that explains why there are so few woman on supervisory board ?
i do not think that this is the case .
i hear that you want the second objective i mentioned .
in some country , society is even taking backward step .
fine word and declaration of good intention are not enough .
we are worth the same and deserve the same .
our concern should be to focus on what is still wrong today .
i do not have the time to explain them all here .
our first task is to raise awareness among woman .
woman 's organisation therefore frequently call on the commission for help .
without this , there will be no europe 2020 .
that must not be the kind of society in which we live .
the second point , commissioner , concern equal access to position of responsibility .
a you know , i am french and i wa against quota .
without quota , there will never be a many woman a there are men
i heard the president of parliament support this view last week .
i think that we really do need to go down this road now .
i feel we now need to resort to that approach , however .
we need proper education and awareness-raising to stamp out violence and stereotype .
equality between men and woman is still not a reality .
much remains to be done and we will see it through together .
nobody asks men or father such question when they are being recruited .
we share a new concern , and that is the feminisation of poverty .
it is wrong that men are becoming richer and woman poorer .
solving female poverty involves more than just forcible intervention in the family environment .
the most recent oecd research show that such intervention ha only limited success .
woman devote more time than men to household work and childcare .
this applies even when the man is on parental leave .
if we are to move forward , we need three basic thing :
the first is support structure for working woman : nursery and crèches ;
the second , commissioner andor , is financial support for woman ; and
today , we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of international woman 's day .
quota are indeed something that woman need if they are to get anywhere .
that is why we need quota and wage equality .
i shall say no more , it ha all been said .
in some case , they moved into position of power and influence .
their idea spread much faster and further than they did .
in many case , there is no identifiable perpetrator .
let u work together to bring about that change .
unfortunately , we do not do reasonably well in the economy .
i have taken note of the intervention about the victim .
it is true that not all victim are female or child .
this is also a question of regulating working time .
that is why we have to act on many front .
we must not extend this discussion solely to working life and public life .
therein lie the wealth of the european vision on these matter .
it fall to u all to show that these objective are achievable .
strong political will need to be backed up by concrete action .
this is obviously because the previous recommendation have not been fully implemented .
we need to make sure that they are implemented by everyone .
lastly , i believe that gender equality remains an issue for u all .
next , i would like to say that i strongly support quota .
we have to make this gender equality become a reality .
and once again , i wish all woman happy day .
it is this factor which lead to the pension gap .
the percentage of woman amongst scientist and engineer ha increased significantly .
however , there are paradoxical figure worthy of consideration .
woman are under-represented in science when we are talking about leadership role .
only 19 % of university professor in the eu are woman .
the promotion of gender equality is a way of combating violence against woman .
we must encourage and support education and information measure and promote good practice .
the counter-crisis measure are directed mainly towards the male population .
the need of woman are perceived a second-level issue .
however , the world still owes a debt to woman .
the fight for gender equality is a daily battle across all our state .
contraceptive must also be made readily available to them .
i therefore advocate that contraceptive should be free , particularly for minor .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
this is a particular honour and privilege for me .
this is also the case for the chair of the committee .
we still have a lot to do in this respect .
our focus and our response must be in line with this .
some time ago , this would have seemed an unlikely association .
the economic crisis hit the le protected group particularly hard .
borrowing the word of saint francis of assisi : lady poverty .
it help enable them to take their decision and shape their life freely .
lastly , lady and gentleman , please allow me a brief digression .
where would our society and our economy be without the talent of woman ?
honourable member , today , we commemorate woman 's fight for equality .
it is woman who shoulder the main responsibility for the child .
this ha it origin in the various norm that society is composed of .
we need to use the whole of our talent base .
quite simply , our competitiveness is also at stake .
granted , we have achieved at great deal in europe .
today , our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of woman .
they look to u to play a pioneering role .
however , we need law and regulation to make these principle a reality .
i believe that this also requires the use of quota .
there are hardly any woman right at the top in management position .
the quota is the instrument whereby we can achieve this .
no one can disagree that we need more woman in the boardroom .
what i can not accept is that we need quota to get there .
well , i gave my rose to a man .
we would reaffirm our group 's solidarity with the struggle of woman here .
it wa in 1893 that new zealand gave woman the vote .
however , i think that the european parliament ha lost touch with reality .
common sense is a stranger to the european union .
request for the waiver of mr elmar brok 's parliamentary immunity (
unfortunately , the immunity system ha turned into a party political issue .
i personally deplore this and hope that our institution will pull itself together .
cooperating with developing country on promoting good governance in tax matter (
i would therefore implore you to vote against paragraph 3 and 9 .
these amendment would lend the report a completely different character .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
that is why we voted in favour of it .
greater transparency is needed for decision which affect human health .
it is quite clear that that system ha failed .
it is a tax on trade rather than on profit .
the economic cost of the crisis are still to be fully assessed .
it is therefore necessary to change , and in an extremely positive way .
i believe we should do the same for the financial system .
it encouraged bank to lend to customer who were not creditworthy .
it is time we learned the lesson of the financial crisis .
in essence , this is a matter for the member state .
i voted against this report despite it many good idea .
i am completely opposed to paragraph 25 , 26 and 29 .
the member state are very different , a are their practice and tradition .
in my opinion , we need an exchange of best practice .
they do not double- and treble-tax the fund that decide to locate there .
agriculture and trade are , in fact , two intersecting policy agenda .
fair competition should be recognised a playing a key role in this respect .
it is unacceptable that it should try and keep u in the dark .
the eu is a net importer of agricultural product .
we have a trade deficit with the mercosur country .
purity is a very important issue in this respect .
this wa apparent during the reform of the sugar market , for example .
it is also essential to help reduce poverty and prevent food crisis .
this type of situation markedly reduces our farmer ' competitiveness and profit .
the united state ha all sort of subsidy a well .
on top of that , we use something called sanitary and phytosanitary standard .
let u stop subsidising unprofitable and unfeasible industry in europe .
the eu did not listen then and it ha not listened since .
this is what the eu ha been doing for longest .
the european union should be secure in it own food security .
food is something that we can not play with .
let u not lose sight of the proven principle of a circular economy .
i am sorry that a majority of parliament ha supported this text .
the same phenomenon can be seen in management role .
premium will rise and fewer people will take up insurance .
take , fifth , the attack on free contract .
mr president , a court with a mission is a menace .
a supreme court with a mission is a tyranny .
under these condition , it is inappropriate to waive the member 's immunity .
in writing . - i abstained on this report .
paying tax is a duty that no citizen should be able to shirk .
i am therefore pleased that he ha rectified his mistake .
the report is nonetheless unpleasant on more than one account .
i am therefore not in favour of waiving his immunity .
the proper functioning of the internal market requires safe product and confident consumer .
it is therefore important to harmonise this complex situation .
directive 2001/95/ec governs the general safety requirement applicable to good .
this is why the motion for revising this directive is more than timely .
i agree with the need to implement certain measure .
i hope that the new rapex china system will help remedy this .
consumer must be guaranteed greater protection from defective and potentially dangerous product .
consequently , this text will allow for more consistent communication between member state .
that is why i voted in favour of the report .
i voted for the report on evaluation of the management of h1n1 influenza .
first , it taught u how to throw money down the drain .
the member state acted unilaterally in ordering and deploying vaccine .
we can no longer allow such confusion and suspicion to surround immunisation campaign .
better cooperation is needed in the response to pandemic .
these factor highlight the fact that a different approach is an absolute must .
the eu ha twice recently faced the problem of a dangerous viral infection .
she urged that study on antiviral medication should be independent of pharmaceutical company .
i am voting to encourage the rapporteur to go further next time .
a always , the report is vague and unspecific .
i voted in favour since there is no other report .
this clearly demonstrates that the who need to revise it pandemic criterion .
i would like to congratulate mr rivasi for her excellent work .
the ecr group ha therefore voted against this report .
it would seem that mr wögerbauer meet the technical criterion .
the committee on fishery therefore proposes that article 28 be deleted .
there is also a vat exemption approach for all basic financial activity .
today 's vote show that this notion extends beyond all political difference .
the report doe not do justice to that situation .
the commission and the council must urgently take note of this .
i support , with some reservation , the podimata report on innovative financing .
therefore , this wa exactly the right time to make this move .
we therefore need new tool and new fiscal policy .
the european union ha the largest financial sector in the world .
the report on innovative financing address a number of important aspect .
that will not create better condition for control of the financial market .
the eu should work very actively to get such a system established .
it should be based on a well-balanced impact assessment .
new mean of financing include taxation of the financial sector and co2 emission .
i agree with having a financial transaction tax at a global level .
the same applies to the scandalous continued existence of tax haven .
for the time being , this is only a policy position .
this idea wa accepted by the european parliament in general term today .
at present , the commission is simply preparing a feasibility study .
short-term investment , which predominate , have led to excessive volatility and risk-taking .
an eu-wide coordinated ftt would be the first step towards a global ftt .
an eu-wide coordinated ftt would be the first step towards a global ftt .
this idea is today the subject of a consensus .
i shall vote against this crude hijacking of what wa a good idea .
the situation where farmer pay tax while financier do not is not acceptable .
for this reason , the report should be rejected .
this would erode the fiscal sovereignty and general sovereignty of the member state .
currently , the majority of financial service are exempt from vat .
a financial transaction tax is the least that can be demanded .
meps have today urged the commission to take step to this end .
it is time for the commission and member state to stop stalling ' .
firstly , i am fundamentally opposed to increasing the eu 's own resource .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report .
we still have a long journey ahead of u .
not all eu citizen have access to quality health service .
for all of the above reason , i supported this report .
access is a key issue in the case of all public service .
meps have therefore called for universal access to affordable healthcare to be improved .
basic care must be le expensive and access to medicine more affordable .
inequality between different social and age group must be reduced .
health and life expectancy are intimately linked to social condition .
however , there are some comment that we need to make .
people on lower income are having increasing difficulty in accessing healthcare .
age-based health inequality result in limited access to adequate healthcare and innovative treatment .
people of this age group are still excluded too often from clinical trial .
increasingly , the link between social determinant and health inequality is being recognised .
the social consequence of the current economic and financial crisis have now unfolded .
this is a problem that need to be resolved .
there are various reason for the health inequality between population group .
we are all very well aware of the importance of health .
inequality in health constitute a problem to be addressed at european level .
we need an innovative political outlook to address them .
the treatment of these condition is not funded in some member state .
therefore , i voted in favour of the report .
it should be highlighted that nobody want to deal with this problem seriously .
therefore , the report of edite estrela is really timely .
the report contains a lot of important proposal for reducing health inequality .
i took the same decision in relation to pre-implantation diagnosis .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the report .
effort need to be concentrated on the development of direct taxation .
this report deal with taxation and development in developing country .
the same resolution wa approved by parliament in 2010 .
appropriate taxation system form a basis for sustainable economic growth and monetary stability .
let u therefore support good taxation policy , but not impose them .
criterion of transparency , information exchange and fair tax competition are fundamental .
the fight against offshore company and other tax evasion is a necessity .
the report doe not say a word about all this .
the idea contained in this report are perfectly suitable for this .
we must therefore leave developing country some discretionary power in this area .
tax play an economic , political and social role in democratic country .
closing eu border to agricultural product from third country is not the answer .
for this reason , the british conservative delegation voted against this report .
in my opinion , this is an essential report .
i voted in favour of mr papastamkos 's report .
this is not the role of commerce , nor can it be .
agriculture represents a strategic sector for the european union .
the restriction weigh a little more each day on the shoulder of farmer .
we have been criticising the failure of neoliberal policy for a long time .
we therefore advocate other solution , given that the report is not consistent .
trade policy should not undermine the dynamic of the eu agricultural sector .
unfortunately , the attitude towards farmer ha not always been fair .
i welcome the clear demand set down in this report .
our trade balance deficit with the mercosur country in this sector is alarming .
also , no precise mention is made of brazil 's situation .
furthermore , the report explicitly threatens argentina with sanction for implementing protectionist measure .
consequently , i am in favour of the papastamkos report .
i voted in favour of this resolution on eu agriculture and international trade .
these condition must be included in bilateral trade agreement .
today in plenary , we voted on the agriculture and international trade report .
i therefore voted against paragraph 53 and 54 of this report .
the eu 's share of global agricultural export is declining .
the eu is the world 's leading importer of agricultural product .
that is why i voted in favour of this report .
the rapporteur present figure that are enlightening and worrying .
imported good must also comply with quality , environmental and social standard .
for most eu country , there are some typical crop .
cultivation of pea is now in decline , however .
the opinion of the czech republic is generally favourable towards the report submitted .
i voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the eu protein deficit .
it is time to relocate the production of plant protein crop .
it is unacceptable that we import 80 % of our requirement .
if such authorisation is provided , what will change ?
i abstained since i do not vote for unclear , 'cooked-up ' initiative .
for these reason , i voted against the report .
however , i think that we should focus more on solution .
the report support the use of genetically modified organism and bone meal .
the protein deficit in the eu is a relevant and important issue .
i believe that this resolution is an important step towards solving this problem .
the production of dried pulse fell by roughly 1 million hectare in 2008 .
even the rapporteur wa forced to vote against his own report .
this involves significant risk , particularly for the european livestock sector .
a series of compromise amendment ha improved the initial report considerably .
that is why i voted against the final text .
i voted in favour of adopting the häusling report .
it is evident that the matter requires urgent action .
countering such disadvantage obviously requires serious public investment in care facility .
i welcome the vote on this report on equality between men and woman .
luckily , the final report is a good one .
the list of grievance is still a long one .
it is therefore unacceptable to want to apply them in private company .
it is also because of this that i voted against .
there have been many struggle fought over those 100 year .
the poverty rate amongst woman ha exceeded 18 % .
where will the talibanism of 'gender equality ' end ?
all these figure prove that it is now necessary to introduce binding measure .
the promotion of equality also involves combating violence against woman .
calling for easy access to abortion is contrary to taking such responsibility .
the eu is made up of men and woman .
the promotion of equality also involves combating violence against woman .
unfortunately , this report is necessary this 8 march 2011 .
the cornerstone of our society is citizenship and the law .
equality between woman and men is a fundamental principle of the european union .
unfortunately , even today , numerous inequality persist between woman and men .
equality between men and woman in employment really must become a reality .
i would like a general campaign in favour of equality to be announced .
however , establishing woman 's quota is the wrong move .
that is why i voted in favour of this report .
otherwise , it is simply a series of platitude .
this resolution offer an analysis of female poverty that i share .
there must be proper social welfare provision for those woman a they age .
poverty is a systemic plague for europe in 2011 .
furthermore , maternity leave must be guaranteed for all woman .
the economic and financial crisis ha affected the entire population .
therefore , in line with the report , poverty ha become feminised .
woman in rural area are in the worst situation .
they have no access to cultural service and good .
unfortunately , the reality is different and the number speak for themselves .
i therefore voted in favour of adopting the document .
at global level , woman are poor by comparison with men .
almost 17 % of european woman are ranked a living in poverty .
today , nearly 17 % of european woman live in poverty .
poverty and equality are two inverse variable in an economic projection .
today , 8 march 2011 , is international woman 's day .
poverty is one area where gap between men and woman remain .
in writing . - i have examined the report thoroughly .
i am particularly struck by the poverty among lone elderly woman .
poverty among woman is a tragic problem , particularly in developing country .
i voted in favour of the report on female poverty in the eu .
combating poverty amongst woman is a moral obligation but also a social investment .
these paragraph were mainly repetition . the final result is also ok .
positive because adopted : eliminate gender inequality in eu 2020 strategy ( para .
i endorsed the report on female poverty in the european union .
education also play a very significant role in combating this problem .
eu measure in this area should be an expression of social solidarity .
female poverty is due , in large measure , to discrimination against woman .
the average gender pay gap is still 18 % in the eu .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
preparation of the eurozone summit of 11 march 2011 ( debate )
we can not countenance any ambiguity on the part of the european union .
we are aware of the challenge that await u .
the road to democratic transition is never an easy one .
it can sometimes be winding and it is always demanding .
the crisis ha shown just how interdependent our economy are .
that is one reason why we must strengthen our economic governance .
these are all legitimate question and we must respond to them unequivocally .
this is a question of mutual confidence and credibility .
competitiveness is indeed an essential element for our economy .
it is a necessary condition for entrenching job-creating growth .
that is what this parliament and the commission want .
the commission will spare no effort to that end .
they do not necessarily need to be identical - just comparable .
at the moment , this is far from being the case .
however , that will probably not always be the case .
now is the time to work on creating job for the future .
now is the time to tell thing a they are .
the key element of this paper will never see the light of day .
however , the situation is kafkaesque to put it mildly .
are you in agreement with this , mr rehn ?
what did germany do in it hour of deepest crisis ?
something like this always happens three day before a european council meeting .
however , people listen to what moody 's ha to say .
so what we are talking about here is a 'hair cut ' .
that is why the pact itself make perfect sense .
that is why i welcome the excellent proposal you have brought forward .
in institutional term , the entire concept wa wrong from the start .
an agreement between state is not what we need .
there is no need for anything at intergovernmental level .
mr merkel and mr sarkozy 's competitiveness pact comprises six specific measure .
however , the pension system is much more complex than that .
that is what we must do a quickly a possible .
( fr ) that is not how it is going to work .
the state and the prime minister are not going to regulate themselves !
the country must also be in a position to make investment .
this is really what the crisis is increasingly about .
these are now core suggestion under the competitiveness pact .
i have suggested a pre-payment incentive , a bonus to reward early repayment .
because their reason for presenting it are not very clear .
the fact that it ha no validity is quite a different issue .
i can not accept their claim that thing simply happened this way .
i believe that they mean thing precisely a stated there .
this is the point i would like to return to once again .
i believe that this is a very serious issue .
after all , even country like germany find this very difficult .
however , we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation .
this is the only way that parliament can monitor this process .
he is saying that we want an economic union .
what should be discussed at the summit on friday is portugal .
we can not go on a a european union buying our own debt .
you constantly refer to belgium a a non-existent nation .
do you know on what basis the belgian state wa founded ?
madam president , i am pleased that mr schulz ha asked me that .
( de ) madam president , i will only be 30 second .
could i ask him what is the basis of the united kingdom ?
it is very difficult to hold together different culture .
that is only to be applauded , of course .
you have picked up that gauntlet , together with president van rompuy .
a such , europe urgently need to finish what it started .
in order to survive , europe ha to change course now .
it wa government that decided this in the treaty of lisbon .
that is the 10 year that have led u nowhere .
this parliament demand to be respected and will defend democracy and effectiveness .
i would like to raise one very specific point .
the way to bring the market under control is not to eliminate them .
i do not belong to a group that seek to abolish the market .
i want to conclude on this point if i might .
the failure of the programme contributes to the wider eurozone financial instability .
the competitiveness pact and it evolution is a case in point .
that is why you need the mechanism , like all the eurozone .
( pt ) madam president , difficult time require brave political decision .
we can not just look at one side of the argument .
what they demand of u is sensible and quick decision .
why not apply article 5 and 121 to deepen fiscal and social policy ?
i want to pose a question to the president .
that is the hope that we will have the necessary change .
however , lady and gentleman , let u have no illusion .
if there is a crisis , the rescue package will be made available .
mr barroso , you said that growth must be distributed more fairly .
the rescue package will result in the burden being distributed even more unjustly .
therefore , if a country is able , it should be avoided .
that is the only way to have the market ' trust .
consequently , it is not up to me to speak on their behalf .
we have pushed to the limit our government ' ambition .
that is the truth of the matter , for we submitted legislative proposal .
therefore , i wa extremely frank and extremely open .
in order to achieve this , both party must remain committed .
on 3 march , the turkish police arrested a number of journalist .
the council continues to closely monitor and review any achievement made .
turkey 's commitment and contribution is indeed essential for such a comprehensive settlement .
these are all issue that need to be resolved urgently .
the commission remains committed to the accession process with turkey .
the enlargement process encourages political and economic reform in the country .
at the same time , accession negotiation have slowed down .
obviously , the cyprus issue weighs on the negotiation .
let me turn now to the reform in turkey .
the commission is following with concern the recent action against journalist .
independence and freedom of the press is of utmost importance for democracy .
the european parliament 's draft resolution rightly underline these issue .
two week ago , the council endorsed the eu-turkey readmission agreement .
relation with turkey have also to be seen in a wider context .
many of these challenge ahead are outlined in your report .
there are six priority , it seems to me .
secondly , check and balance are the basis of any democratic system .
that is why something must be done about providing a democratic opening .
law are all very fine , but enforcement is also important .
thing have to change in that respect in the coming election .
fifthly , the ankara protocol is vital , in my opinion .
by the way , these are not just my priority .
everything i have mentioned ha been under discussion in turkish society a well .
freedom of the press : last friday , i received an open letter .
a free and tolerant debate is of crucial importance to any country .
what will happen when the last chapter are opened ?
our 2010 report is highly critical , but also constructive .
it is a central issue , because it is the political criterion .
in diplomatic term , we need turkey and turkey also need u .
now , everyone can see that it is not .
my personal view ha always been very supportive of turkish aspiration towards europe .
on cyprus , it must stop hiding behind what happened in 2004 .
instead , eroglu ha called for the protester to be brought to trial .
i particularly appreciate the position taken by mr füle .
turkey doe not want to be a secular country any longer .
instead , it ha opted for the muslim brotherhood of hamas .
lady and gentleman , when are we going to stop this sham ?
europe doe not want turkey and europe doe not want islam .
however , a backward islamic culture ha no place in europe .
prime minister erdoğan , are you a real man or a subservient coward ?
how much longer will you continue humiliating the turkish people ?
take the honourable way out and stop doing that .
turkey is running out of chapter and the accession process risk stalling .
fourteen chapter are frozen because turkey stubbornly refuse to extend the ankara protocol .
that this requires a firm approach from everyone involved .
this report is honest - too honest for some .
this is a region which requires particularly delicate and well-balanced policy .
the 2010 progress report is , in reality , a fault report .
this ha been confirmed by the recent arrest of two journalist .
a recent survey show how the turk really see the eu .
we should break off the accession negotiation a quickly a possible .
i am in favour of strong link between turkey and the european union .
turkey is strategically important to u , but not at any price .
therefore , i am of the opinion that turkey is not yet ready .
the example of mor gabriel form part of this issue .
they would , of course , be opposed to it .
in this case , the language question take priority .
the union supported the government 's effort to stamp out the para-state .
madam president , i greatly regret that the turkish accession process is stalled .
we must intensify negotiation with turkey all the more .
this position must not , of course , be abused .
no progress ha been made in the sphere of democratic right , either .
a far a i am concerned , this is essential .
these are just some of the requirement for opening chapter 23 .
it is time to show that the european parliament can make a difference .
turkey 's accession would have a detrimental effect on integration , too .
a privileged partnership - that would combine the best of both world .
in the commission 's assessment , turkey fulfils the political criterion sufficiently .
they also summarise the complicated relationship between turkey and europe .
it is still haggling over every tiny obligation towards the european union .
i have long been a supporter of turkish accession .
i could speak about this issue for a long time .
unfortunately , it is now a little too late .
a you have seen , mr cashman ha already left the chamber .
it neighbour also need to make their move in this direction .
however , i would like to say one thing in conclusion .
in my opinion , that would be honest on our part .
madam president , turkey 's momentum towards eu accession continues to falter .
a candidate country can not occupy european union territory .
the eu is therefore indirectly involved in a military conflict with turkey .
madam president , the report is rather given to understatement .
i quote , 'significant effort are needed on fundamental right ' .
chapter 23 and 15 are among those being frozen unilaterally .
there is also no doubt that turkey must strive for good neighbourhood relation .
the council ha received it share of criticism for not addressing this issue .
however , let u also think about all that depends on u .
how prepared are we to conclude the accession negotiation with croatia ?
how prepared are we to admit romania and bulgaria to the schengen area ?
how prepared are we to uplift europe 's hard-fated community , the rom ?
inclusion is on the agenda in a great variety of context .
let me state this with a great deal of openness .
i believe that maybe we should be thinking in a somewhat longer term .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 9 march 2011 .
this conflict cast a huge shadow over turkey 's eu accession negotiation .
this is why turkey must demonstrate proper determination to resolve the dispute .
we are two year away from an important anniversary .
it is beyond dispute that much ha happened since then .
support for eu membership is falling among turkish citizen .
we have confirmed montenegro 's european perspective on several occasion .
we are expecting serious progress from montenegro in this respect a well .
lady and gentleman , montenegro play an important part in regional cooperation .
the resolution to be adopted by parliament represents an actual stocktaking of achievement .
the onus is now on montenegro to meet the eu 's expectation .
montenegro should be judged solely on merit , fact and achievement .
i am pleased that montenegro can now pursue a path towards eu membership .
however , there are area that require vigorous reform .
i welcome montenegro 's membership of the european union a soon a possible .
every former communist country ha had to face analogous difficulty .
montenegro ha made good progress in the integration process .
the country also play a constructive role in maintaining regional stability .
obviously , combating corruption and organised crime remains key .
i welcome the promotion of montenegro a a state championing the green movement .
one of the eu 's key objective is environmental protection .
one consequence could be to extend the future accession negotiation .
i hope that our montenegrin friend will solve this problem a well .
it is a difficult path , but one which is not impossible .
however , there are serious gap in the implementation of legislation .
instead , we have seen an increase in economic migrant .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 9 march 2011 .
let me briefly outline the most important principle and recommendation of my report .
let u not forget what is at stake here .
we share your ambition to ensure that promise are followed by deed .
on 8 april , the international day of the rom is celebrated worldwide .
segregation form a vicious circle and creates fault line within society .
i am also very pleased that the resolution cover gender equality a well .
all woman must be allowed to put their ability to good use .
we need more rom woman in decision making a well .
i ask all of you to assist with this effort .
permit me to update you on where we stand .
here , determined action is needed both at national and eu level .
when we speak of opportunity , we also mean economic opportunity .
it is essential to underpin policy with sufficient financial resource .
the commission will carefully look into this interesting proposal .
madam president , please allow me to begin by recounting a story .
their crime wa that their two child did not attend school .
rather , it wa their circumstance that did not allow them to learn .
passable road are required , which provide access to school and the workplace .
madam president , i congratulate mr járóka on her excellent cooperation .
responsibility for integration doe not lie entirely with the authority .
i am grateful to both commissioner for mentioning the issue of poverty .
the effort made on a local level are also important .
i hope that the commission can come up with a good rom strategy .
in their word , it is work in progress .
finally , i would like to thank mr járóka for her excellent report .
we simply wanted to highlight the problem relating to local authority and community .
it is very much about the basic human right of this population group .
it is about equal access to education , healthcare and social service .
there is , though , one thing i would like to add .
i blame that mr sarkozy for pretending to expel them .
we could then make this person president of the commission .
her many year of work have reached an important milestone today .
however , a single european area indeed requires a single strategy , too .
we can not approach the rom strategy solely from a cultural perspective .
similarly , it can not be solved solely by mean of social policy .
the reason for this is that education is a fundamental aspect of employability .
the rom must make a contribution to all of this .
the time ha come for u to turn word into action .
doing that really allows you to see the state of thing .
i , indeed , have a lot of expectation on that score .
your pilot project would be a very good set-up .
we must also acknowledge that there are cultural difference which sometimes seem irreconcilable .
i hope that they will be implemented by all member state government .
they must not become object of policy managed from on high .
the majority ha more responsibility , but the minority still ha some .
national minority should be integrated without the need for forced assimilation .
finally , the ban on discrimination is not sufficient .
actually , the romanian government deal fully with the integration of this minority .
public authority should act a beneficiary organisation for the project .
i understand from this discussion that we have to go forward with simplification .
i want , however , to clarify two thing very briefly .
the free movement directive ha been questioned by some member .
the analysis of the transposition by all member state ha been finalised .
in 2010 , we visited 21 member state and six visit are planned .
i would not , and can not , resolve this debate .
i believe that we all need to take a new approach .
rapporteur . - madam president , i will be very brief .
i would like to thank you very much for all your valuable comment .
this will place the whole situation in a new light .
most of the measure implemented so far are so-called legally unenforceable regulation .
it is a pan-european problem , which must be resolved without delay .
i support the draft resolution concerning the strategy on rom inclusion .
the rom are among the most disadvantaged population group throughout europe .
the gender equality problem is worse in minority group .
the next item is question time ( b7-0019/2011 ) .
i have no alternative in the circumstance we find ourselves in tonight .
subject : framework directive on minimum income in the eu
but more need to be done to fully implement active inclusion reform .
we can then build additional policy on to that .
what conclusion doe the commission draw from this study ?
however , there is one problem in this area .
you have child and you know how it is .
mr leichtfried from austria and i are very concerned about this .
how can we make it clear that this is something dangerous ?
we do not seem to be able to learn from past mistake .
the question relates to cfl , or compact fluorescent lamp .
i am happy to look into this again in more depth .
in very concrete term , what will the package consist of ?
vice-president of the commission . - i absolutely agree .
i , too , have felt that victim have been somewhat absent .
it is a very unfair situation , amounting to a negation of right .
subject : commission proposal on a common consolidated corporate tax base
indeed , it will tackle some major fiscal impediment to company ' competitiveness .
the aim is to answer a many question a possible .
our joint overall assessment is twofold and i will outline it briefly .
the commission therefore encourages greece to show resolve in it privatisation programme .
a reduction in interest rate , a you also mentioned ?
this is an absolute farce and this is a point of order .
it is unsatisfactory ; i have made my view known before .
because at all time , it is question time that suffers .
it is difficult for me now to take even mr posselt 's question .
it launching summit took place on 7 may 2009 .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:50 and resumed at 21:05 )
we must , of course , focus on a number of specific area .
we also need to pay more attention to resource .
simply saying that this is important is not enough .
we need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity .
that is a starting point for action on raw material .
the recycling rate for mobile phone is only 1.5 % .
i would like to make one last point in this context .
innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves .
a regard the member state , i believe the reaction ha been positive .
commissioner , thank you for that small insight into woman in business .
the issue of free trade and free and undistorted competition have become dogma .
lastly , there is the question of location , which is very important .
european policy are successful if they find a region able to tackle them .
we can only achieve this by mean of an integrated and sustainable policy .
this mean that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy .
however , this report can only represent the first step .
the current example of e10 in germany demonstrates that this is not happening .
we need to have the consumer on our side .
for this reason , i wish the industrial policy project every success .
nevertheless , i believe that this report represents important progress .
however , we do not want to see strong state control or protectionism .
the competitiveness of european firm depends on the continuing economic stability of europe .
europe ha long ceased to be a leader in the area of innovation .
it is of fundamental importance to support innovative project .
however , there are many contradictory position in the report we are debating .
look at germany , look at china , look at spain .
we are not saying that mr trichet should not raise interest rate .
yes , because european union country are proving that they do .
modern industrial policy is so much more than that .
another key issue for a modern and sustainable industry is recurrent training programme .
secondly , an economy based on innovation and the free movement of knowledge .
thirdly , the transition to a low carbon economy is a key step .
so the linkage between innovation skill and sustainability is evident .
lastly , one element missing for me is the digital agenda .
( de ) madam president , i have a question for mr reul .
this morning , we celebrated the 100th anniversary of international woman 's day .
i believe that industrial policy is part of the change .
we need european and national public financial centre to guarantee industrial financing .
the attention devoted to the subject of intellectual property protection is significant .
tomorrow , his collaborative method will be crowned with success .
lady and gentleman , we must use these mean to finance it .
europe is currently finding it competitiveness in global market decreased .
this report 's very goal is tabling proposal to relaunch european industry .
industrial policy can not function without an integrated market .
the internal market is still too fragmented and requires completion .
industrial policy ha been neglected and left to the market for too long .
it account for three quarter of our export , namely 5.5 million enterprise .
self-protection is not protectionism ; we must therefore have an industrial policy .
a regard research , we are going to review the seventh framework programme .
we have eur 30 billion to spend in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .
let u be very cautious about exiting the crisis .
in europe , we can boast excellence in many field .
just look how clever and clean the eu 2020 strategy is !
however , i do have one concern , and that is globalisation .
commissioner tajani , i wish to invite you to join in that debate .
regarding the long-term objective , we need to make a much bigger leap .
a you know , commissioner , management mean looking ahead .
i have a few criticism and proposal to make .
my second consideration is the lack of any innovative financing proposal .
there need to be a greater link between research and innovation .
it is , unfortunately , necessary to act in time and quickly .
if it were not financed , it would remain empty word .
in voting this morning , we faced up to that .
it is for exchange founded on reciprocity and balance .
to this end , however , we will need the entire innovation chain .
furthermore , we must encourage synergy within the sector .
these include the link between energy policy and industrial policy .
there are many positive point in it , which i strongly support .
we must take innovative small business and help them grow .
it ha been a pleasure working on this report .
every one of the participant wanted to add something to it .
we believe that social dialogue can not be circumvented .
it is good to see that industry is back on europe 's agenda .
i think that what we need is a balanced european economy .
those of u on the agriculture side would say the very same .
so i think this is an important report on all front .
the european copper industry ha become an example of such an adverse impact .
the idea that the market should regulate themselves ha been proved wrong .
in addition to traditional industrial zone , powerful new industrial centre are growing .
we can also work on finding substitute for rare raw material .
therefore , we must continue to work on implementing the small business act .
mr tajani , the four key message which bring u together are clear .
the vote will take place at 11:30 on wednesday , 9 march 2011 .
the social situation is deteriorating in poland , but improving in italy .
a sound industrial policy is needed , but not economic nationalism .
securing europe 's supply of rare earth element ( debate )
the question to the commission are direct and urgent :
a successful eu raw material strategy must be aimed at encouraging free trade .
it should not involve stockpiling raw material with taxpayer ' money .
if it is an efficient use of resource , they will do so .
we need suggestion from the commission regarding raw material and rare earth element .
no area of our policy must therefore be neglected .
then i will talk about the relationship with china .
the second pillar is about ensuring a more sustainable supply within the eu .
the third pillar concern recycling and the efficient use of resource .
i have already told you about our relation with russia and latin america .
there have also been environmental and working environment dispute .
the eu ought to invest a great deal in research and development .
that is something that we have not managed to do particularly well yet .
do we have a procedure at the wto regarding rare earth ?
thirdly , the recovery of rare earth from recycling .
are we moving towards a set of european rule on so-called urban mining ?
japan ha also reacted more quickly and more effectively .
how much are we making available a part of the seventh framework programme ?
it go without saying that we need trade policy .
we must also develop our own reserve , where they are available .
we also need specific , concrete plan for recycling rees .
the commission 's communication make no direct mention of recycling .
the statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criterion .
the commission should therefore play the role of mediator here .
a modern raw material policy must be characterised by partnership .
however , i have the impression that very little ha happened since then .
they are therefore vital to new clean energy a well .
we can therefore congratulate the commission for the raw material strategy .
we need madame curie , we need scientist , we need breakthrough technology .
it is therefore only the largest investor which can afford them .
naturally , i shall inform parliament about what ha been done .
commissioner de gucht is responsible for the commercial part .
the examination is already at an advanced stage of completion .
current legislation cover 40 % of the waste produced in the eu .
rare earth are a key element of the european economy .
it should be noted that their extraction is extremely complicated .
possibility of using gas from alternative source in europe ( debate )
until a few year ago , the usa wa an importer of gas .
i am not drawing any conclusion from this development at the moment .
it is also in the interest of some member state .
in addition , there are health and safety regulation for eu citizen .
all of these thing have to be taken into consideration .
in germany , however , there is also the issue of acceptance .
we must follow up these development without prejudging them .
thirdly , commissioner , you said that we must comply with environmental standard .
we are nonetheless 10 year behind the united state in term of exploitation .
and you say , 'it is an economic opportunity ' .
the new york moratorium is a good illustration of the problem .
we are therefore simply requesting that the licence be revoked .
let u hope that we - europe - do not waste this opportunity .
the holder of these licence include major global energy concern .
of course , we must focus on the efficient use of gas .
europe is the region with the greatest buying power .
we also need to consider the importance of pipeline in future .
in fact , we are already benefiting from this .
the commission is proposing to review the regulatory framework .
the u environmental protection agency ( epa ) is undertaking a major study .
scientist are forecasting that a similar scenario could occur in the european union .
the situation in the middle east is also having a definite impact .
this will be reflected in higher extraction cost , which mean exorbitant price .
three oil company have already obtained a licence to do this in romania .
the biogas market is also one of best developed in europe .
however , exploiting unconventional gas source pose significant environmental and social risk .
this should primarily be the task of the commission .
we therefore urgently need to diversify our energy source .
it is for this scenario that we must prepare ourselves , starting now .
i would like to share three fact with you on this matter .
i think it is good news for our colleague .
shale gas is an opportunity to be a part of the solution .
one difference certainly exists compared to the united state .
europe 's population density is much higher than in the u .
in germany , there are 520 diesel-engined vehicle for every 1 000 people .
in the new member state , the figure is below 200 .
thirdly , our own deposit of gas are shrinking .
this will result in a dependency level of 80 % .
this would be unlikely to have any major impact outside poland 's border .
nevertheless , i am happy to discus the subject of common regulation .
there is room for improvement in the european regulation .
it applies to the quota for woman and it also applies here .
for this reason , we will investigate the possibility for improvement .
all this ha been happening without any definite conclusion being drawn .
i advise everyone not to bring emotion into this subject .
i would like to make one last point which is off the record .
i do not think that there are any important event going on elsewhere .
this sort of behaviour is not good for parliament 's reputation .
southern neighbourhood , and libya in particular , including humanitarian aspect ( debate )
i believe we have to respond to those call .
we have every reason to back the change under way .
on the humanitarian aid side , we have moved quickly .
that work , i can tell you , is ongoing this week .
we started preparatory work on restrictive measure ahead of the un security council .
we can and we have to respond in a strategic and united way .
can we stand aside whilst innocent civilian are massacred ?
he is a murderer who belongs before an international criminal court .
we are faced with a major challenge that requires a clear head .
we have to make a choice , including in what we say here .
you can not make these trite demand and then do nothing !
i think three thing are necessary in this message .
it is a libyan revolution and it ha to remain a libyan revolution .
those are the three key element that are necessary today .
this message must be sent today to that region .
for year , we have failed to do that .
so you have now ceased negotiating with colonel gaddafi ?
do you really think you could have carried on ?
wa nobody interested in how those refugee were treated by colonel gaddafi ?
yet they are saying : 'we want a no-fly zone ' .
the african union is talking about a no-fly zone .
the arab league is talking about a no-fly zone .
the military exclusion zone is , first and foremost , a political act .
this is a political act that we must carry out .
now , there is also the issue of humanitarian aid .
lastly , food aid and military aid are needed , too .
let u ensure that what happened in bosnia is not repeated .
an embargo wa imposed on the bosnians and on the serb .
no , it is one side against the other here .
we want a military embargo , an arm embargo against colonel gaddafi .
i would like to end on the subject of refugee and humanitarian aid .
now , of course , he stand accused of terrorising his own people .
you want the dictator to leave their country , and you are right .
we can imagine what it will mean if gaddafi succeeds .
we are on the side of the democratic revolution .
there is a sharing of the workload here at the international level .
what do we do if moscow and beijing do not grant their assent ?
well , then we would have to close this loophole in international law .
i have twice appealed at least for a mission to be sent there .
the people are calling for freedom and better living condition .
we therefore must not treat this a run-of-the-mill and we must act quickly .
it is therefore important that relation be established with the interim council .
this must also include u preventing gaddafi from bombing his own people .
however , europe can not just settle for a humanitarian response .
here , mr cohn-bendit , we have mr berlusconi .
this must be the appropriate response for europe at this time .
we have needed 25 year to reach the same conclusion today .
those kiss , of course , were not entirely without foundation .
in a few day , a summit is to be held .
we can not afford to lose another 25 year .
our problem is not that we do not understand the time .
our problem is that we are slow to act .
our problem is that what we do is not effective .
what are the specific step needed to de-legitimise gaddafi ?
the first is that we must jointly pull our ambassador out of tripoli .
indeed , it provides food for thought for the european institution .
lastly , we must urgently help these country to manage their migratory flow .
we must come up with a suitable european financial plan .
we must strengthen the european union 's humanitarian presence .
i think we can not do without a long-term marshall-type plan .
there are 2 million immigrant , 1 million egyptian and 80 000 bangladeshi .
we expect a resounding response from the union on friday .
mr president , the european parliament must be involved .
meanwhile , you have spoken about bringing the guilty party to justice .
we can not continue to bury our head in the sand .
china censor the internet while russia kill journalist such a anna politkovskaya .
and the proposal made by the commission and mr ashton yesterday .
of course they are done in conjunction with our partner .
the arab league will discus a no-fly zone on saturday .
we may not like that , and it is a genuine debate .
isolation is effective in some circumstance , but engagement is better .
i want to just also say something about label .
i have been wall to wall on the airwave .
but i have also done far more without the press in the room .
mr president , perhaps baroness ashton could comment on this .
there are two reason that i did not reply .
the second is because it will be for the member state to determine .
then , the european council will take a decision .
it is for the member state to take the decision .
the vote will take place on thursday , 10 march 2011 .
the rebel ' call for a no-fly zone pose u a dilemma .
furthermore , what would the eu 's position be should gaddafi change course ?
muammar gaddafi 's departure is a matter of urgency today .
however , a democratic transition will never succeed without real opposition leader .
at the moment , that opposition is very weak .
giving it greater visibility is a first necessary step towards creating momentum .
on the other hand , a strong regional strategy is also necessary .
the result : health condition are worsening , which is fuelling intracommunity tension .
instead , they acted on humanitarian ground and waived visa requirement .
for sure it will be large and very significant for malta .
they demand solidarity and a relocation policy based on the principle of burden-sharing .
it is very disappointing and incomprehensible to see the ppe shirking this responsibility .
the status quo approach wa the prevalent choice for almost 40 year .
this policy gave europe the benefit of stability and safe access to energy .
but it ignored the society of north africa and of the arab world .
we know this because these society re-emerged dramatically and took everybody by surprise .
the european neighbourhood policy should stay in place a a policy .
this would send a negative signal towards the society in our eastern neighbourhood .
the per caput spending in the south and the east is not unbalanced .
the problem is not how much we spend but how we spend .
secondly , we can not overcome this crisis with budgetary discipline alone .
for that reason , effort to promote growth and competitiveness make sense .
that mean that we also see the weakness of the intergovernmental approach .
what principle and rule should be established for providing assistance ?
i know that some of you are disappointed with this approach .
i have to say , the commission share your disappointment .
because europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the market .
it is like paying into an insurance policy which never pay out .
we should therefore consider very carefully what we do .
we have decided not to have a final vote today .
it really is unfortunate that the parliament is behaving in this manner .
doe anyone here really believe that the council is listening to u ?
what there wa - or not - wa the merkel-sarkozy pact .
that awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism .
but i have not heard so much nonsense spoken a i have today .
i can not imagine an economics class tolerating such fatuous and intemperate nonsense .
doe he not know of the excessive deficit position of the uk ?
i wa right in spade , wa i not ?
my reaction a a democrat is quite simple : so what ?
the recital raise the concept of eurobonds , woolly-worded and with no detail .
doe this hand over the sovereign right to manage one 's own treasury ?
why is it being amended , and how are we going about it ?
is it because the amendment of the treaty is unimportant ?
so , what will be the result of the amendment of the treaty ?
a wish list ha been put forward in this regard .
the member state themselves have likewise failed to observe their obligation .
it is also undoubtedly necessary to introduce a euro area stability mechanism .
( pt ) i can summarise my position in three point .
intergovernmental solution will not , in the long run , lead u anywhere .
that is unacceptable and parliament actually ha to be opposed to this proposal .
we must push the commission into action that it should already have taken .
to this end , we must go further than current emergency dictate .
we must avoid creating dual system that would do more harm than good .
it is not about any dispute between the institution .
that said , i would like to underline three point .
at the same time , these package do overlap .
we therefore need to act , and we need to act fast .
it must also take into account the participation of all 27 member state .
they are trying to impose a veritable straitjacket on the member state .
the euro is the guarantee of european stability , growth and unity .
parliament 's calendar of part-sessions - 2012 ( vote )
parliament 's calendar of part-sessions - 2013 ( vote )
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
can you please urge the authority to get a grip of this ?
otherwise , we will be treated with the contempt we deserve .
i have two point to raise , if you please .
mr clark , you have a point of order not a speech .
i am sorry , but i have to stop you .
mr president , i would not normally rise on such a point .
this is a decision that parliament took on monday .
if this wa an error , it need to be corrected .
we did so this time with those member who were in the chamber .
who is in favour of voting to change the agenda ?
it is also important that we are opening up to the balkan state .
there are indeed many problem to be solved there .
we would also like to thank you for your work on this .
we are very interested in what you are going to say .
clear-mindedness and open attentiveness towards each other befit it tradition .
we are not forming coalition of state , we are uniting men ' .
moreover , this never allowed u to forget fraternity and solidarity .
the desire for freedom of any nation can not be suppressed forever .
please allow me to expand on a few point .
we must shoulder responsibility for closing the development gap .
the citizen of the european union deserve equal opportunity .
assuming responsibility is required at a macro-regional level a well .
europe must be able to react to rapid change in the world .
the eastern partnership is neither a hungarian nor a polish priority .
could we call ourselves good european if we did not do this ?
i am convinced that we need this common action plan .
two apparently opposing characteristic are needed for this : humility and tenacity .
even the sun wa blotted out from our vision .
it is at least equally important that we build on european foundation .
the ambitious programme we call europe 2020 is about precisely this .
i quote : 'we need to build this way of life further .
all i can add to this is so be it .
i apologise for this but we have to keep to the time .
what i would like to do is to offer a constructive suggestion .
but let u have one seat , one way or the other .
the atlantic region is particularly important for fishing , transport and energy .
it is time that this house called for the cessation of accession negotiation .
it is also very important to consider the situation in cyprus .
we could have reasonably pursued one of two policy .
we have made promise which we have no intention of fulfilling .
now , look at it from ankara 's point of view .
turk defended europe 's flank against bolshevik expansionism for 50 year .
we may one day ask them to do the same against jihadi extremism .
a politically integrated europe including turkey a a member is not possible .
it is a grand delusion that we must finally step away from .
unfortunately , i did not receive an answer to that specific question .
firstly , it is a resolution which is important for croatia .
thing have to go on then , too , but how ?
we need to integrate the small but difficult remainder of south-eastern europe .
first of all , there is macedonia , and then montenegro .
i look forward already to the negotiation with montenegro !
it is therefore good that we have this report .
the danish liberal party ha therefore voted in favour of this report .
it is moving in the right direction for the rom .
for these reason , i voted against the rest of my group .
this inadequacy need to be rectified a soon a possible .
the strategy actually aim at inclusion and not merely integration .
the rom question is a paradoxical one for europe in many sens .
that is why we need to invest in education in particular .
soft law is no longer enough , and soft measure are not either .
we need consistent legislation and practical measure that are binding on everyone .
all the member state and eu institution are responsible for this .
( sk ) mr president , we are talking about rom integration issue .
the rom live in many european country - both western and eastern country .
( fi ) mr president , efharisto , thank you .
this report by mr járóka is an excellent one .
now is the time to ask a fundamental question .
it is also very important to organise followup for this report .
this is the way to tackle this issue properly and successfully .
we must make sure that our european market creates it own added value .
it is just such investment which today 's economy need .
european industry is facing powerful competitive pressure from developing country .
now that is something my country would not agree with .
that is the case with euskadi , the basque country .
what businessman in his right mind would keep two factory ?
we waste £150 million each year by having 11 session here in strasbourg .
travelling to strasbourg is expensive and the increased travel cause extra co2 emission .
it will also send a positive signal to our electorate .
that amendment is quite simply a violation of the treaty !
the supporter of the alsace seat must speak out more .
the eu treaty require parliament to hold 12 session in strasbourg each year .
in other word , it is a budget marked by restraint and austerity .
it also take into account the possible accession of croatia in 2013 .
this is an austerity budget which stay in line with inflation .
remarkably , one priority is a european house of history .
the report 'sets the principle of legislative excellence a a priority ' .
at present , there are unacceptable omission in both area .
that is why i supported mr fernandes by voting in favour .
the treaty of lisbon ha given parliament new responsibility .
there are other mechanism and way of solving common problem and priority .
for these reason , i voted against the budget report .
the eu , too , should reduce it expenditure .
a real effort need to be made towards consolidation .
these strategy can and should address issue of common interest .
atlantic coastal region leisure and tourism activity also constitute valuable economic resource .
this strategy aim at better spending of eu money , not increasing expenditure .
i supported the report , but nevertheless remain of the same mind .
i voted in favour of this resolution on turkey 's 2010 progress report .
hitherto , turkey ha made rather slow progress with regard to reform .
turkey is likely to expect parliament 's resolution to benefit it more .
when will we have the courage to get out of this trap ?
we swedish social democrat support the demand for turkey to recognise the genocide .
nonetheless , there are certain problem hampering the advancement of this process .
that should be a central point in this resolution .
however , the resolution is complacent a regard the continuation of this situation .
then he should say so clearly and act accordingly .
these include freedom of religion and acknowledging the right of woman .
the union , however , should also take a look in the mirror .
admitting turkey to our union would make u larger and economically more powerful .
we must also recognise turkey 's stabilising geopolitical significance .
turkish coloniser and occupying troop are still on the island .
and what about integration between the union and turkey ?
most of turkey is not geographically part of europe .
given the circumstance , however , what else could be expected ?
it is really time to come clean with turkey .
the european union need turkey and turkey need the eu .
normalisation of relation with cyprus is another important issue .
it is important to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict .
i voted in favour of the report , because it is well balanced .
it reflects well the state of turkey 's eu integration in 2010 .
the negotiation are regarded a 'a long-lasting and open-ended process ' .
these negotiation are currently going through a particularly delicate phase .
for these reason , i voted against the report .
the pace certainly need to be stepped up , too .
turkey remains one of the eu 's most important partner .
the idea of it full membership , however , is becoming increasingly illusory .
the independence of the medium should also be a concern .
montenegro ha shown that it want to continue with it european choice .
the accession of new state depends on various factor .
the eu beckons with million of euro in so-called 'aid ' and development .
this is why we have out doubt about this process .
the decision to grant candidate status to montenegro wa primarily political .
however , the comparison work to the advantage of montenegro , of course .
there is no fundamental progress in sight regarding the fight against all-pervasive corruption .
montenegro 's fate , meanwhile , is entirely in it own hand .
nobody like to be led by the nose for too long .
the union ha been reduced to an aggressive and pretentious liberal doctrine .
i want no part of it . i shall vote against .
there are still problem a regard minority and unprotected group a well .
i therefore voted for this motion for a resolution .
however , attack on journalist and activist are still being reported .
eu integration is the main driving force behind montenegro 's progress .
the eu and montenegro therefore signed a stabilisation and association agreement .
the rapporteur expects negotiation to start after the 2011 progress report .
the most important are paragraph 23 , 24 and 32 .
approximately 10-12 million rom reside in the european union .
that is why i voted in favour of this text .
the rom situation in the eu is rather complicated .
indeed , the instrument are there but they are utilised particularly badly .
however , no one must expect change to occur quickly .
i hope eu government now respond to this strong message from parliament .
the implementation and correct application of this policy should also be ensured .
they must be used in a way that will benefit the rom .
the rom should therefore be involved in any decision making .
this is a scandalous prejudice aimed once again at marginalising the rom community .
parliament ha defined it priority , on which there is a consensus .
however , i think that the biggest effort is still to be made .
this report cover the development of an eu strategy on rom inclusion .
rarely ha a european parliament report come so close to madness .
these are all area in which action is needed .
the rom need to be involved in making policy .
the rom are culturally one of the richest nation in the world .
their presence lends variety to the landscape of many different country .
we are afraid of what we do not know .
what is required is prioritisation , smart spending of fund and political commitment .
decisive step must be taken to bring discrimination to an end .
i voted for the report on the eu strategy on rom inclusion .
however , much remains to be done to prevent discrimination .
the report before u admittedly address some of the problem , however one-sidedly .
the european union strategy should ensure clear objective and mean of funding programme .
without education , it is impossible to take an active role in society .
the report further highlight the primordial role of regional policy .
it is scheduled to be adopted by the council before the summer .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
this is the thrust of this resolution , which i endorsed .
that sector will be central to the future competitiveness of the eu .
europe is currently finding that it ha become le competitive in global market .
our policy must show that social innovation and technological innovation are compatible .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
clearly , europe must develop a long-term european industrial strategy .
it must also support it production sector and it sme base .
european industry wa already going through a restructuring process before the crisis stated .
the rapporteur proposes a whole raft of measure to make this possible .
only the excellence of european industry can make this happen .
we hope that we are capable of rising to the challenge .
this is another report that is full of contradiction .
however , the report insists on advocating these policy .
unfortunately , all the proposal were rejected by the majority in parliament .
we therefore voted against in the final vote on the resolution by parliament .
the recent profound economic crisis ha hit european industry .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
small and medium-sized enterprise must be encouraged to invest in cluster .
smes need to be guaranteed favourable condition and easier access to financing .
a single job in industry creates at least two more job .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
business must react appropriately to ever faster change in economic trend .
the main objective for eu industry are a growth in competitiveness and innovativeness .
the bureaucratic burden on business should be reduced and the legal framework simplified .
project bond serve a finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation project .
the sitting is suspended at 13:45 and shall resume at 15:00 .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the result is something that we can be proud of .
the concern of the whole international community are more than justified .
the resolution also go into iran 's role in the region .
and building confidence is what our effort are all about .
i understand iran 's wish to see sanction removed .
that wa the path we were trying to go down .
i see no value in re-writing or re-interpreting it in any selective way .
the report also underline the seriousness of the increase in execution in iran .
i want the death penalty abolished , whatever the method .
i saw that in the case of m ashtiani .
both the execution and the process leading up to it were shocking .
no one in the world want the iranian bomb .
we all want complete and transparent collaboration with the international atomic energy agency .
unfortunately , they have not met with a positive response .
the second aspect that worry u is iran 's role in the region .
iran 's attitude to israel remains intolerable and unacceptable .
it support for organisation that destabilise the region can not be tolerated .
large part of the region are in fear of iran 's policy .
the internal political situation is dramatic where human right and democracy are concerned .
targeted sanction against representative of the regime must also be extended .
it is also a contradictory example a regard political freedom .
a list of 80 name ha been leaked and attributed to your office .
baroness ashton , you must now draw some conclusion from the report .
iran ha deceived and obstructed the international community time and time again .
however , sanction will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation .
iran is naturally an important player in the middle east .
they did so at the risk of their own life .
they took to the street because they wanted greater democracy .
we need to extend a helping hand to them against the regime .
are we still paying attention to the fate of mr karoubi ?
i want to pay sincere tribute to these brave woman .
the example of libya is a case in point .
even now , we have failed to turn iran into a democratic regime .
what is more , he oppresses his own people in an appalling way .
never have so many people been executed a over the last year .
the ahmadinejad regime can not be tackled hard enough .
i look forward to the day that this regime fall .
woman human right defender are particularly at risk in iran .
the death penalty is also arbitrarily used , especially on minor .
mr president , i do not want to take up too much time .
baroness ashton ha not received a vote in her life .
they must , of course , come from within iran .
hence , it is obvious that the european union support the iranian opposition .
turkey is an important partner for the european union .
true , this change can not be imposed from outside .
it would be a long road but the only sensible one for iran .
whatever else , it doe nothing whatsoever for geopolitical stability in the area .
unfortunately , sanction often hit precisely this young and active civil society .
the victim of this abandonment are thus internationally minded student .
furthermore , the iranian authority have turned violating human right into a habit .
iran 's nuclear ambition are also endangering the population .
this is more than with any one other country .
that is morally wrong and to the eu 's shame .
madam high representative , let u not forget these sorely tried people .
a far a that go , i am very mindful of my responsibility .
i am trying to continue to get that clarification .
i listened very attentively to what you had to say .
that is certainly something that is close to my heart .
this also benefit the region in term of overall security .
the vote will take place at midday on thursday , 10 march .
the eu will present an initiative on freedom of religion or belief .
we are seriously concerned about the deteriorating human right situation in iran .
we hope this mission will be dispatched without delay .
but in the end , these are only input .
the real test is whether we make a difference on the ground .
this is a key objective of the ongoing review process .
we will continue to push for an ambitious result .
the unhrc should become more an early-warning and preventive mechanism .
her appointment contributes to advancing gender equality in the external action service .
it is ironic that this session will address seven individual country situation .
it must also be willing to listen and able to compromise .
so to my last point : the eu 's performance .
we are talking the talk , but not walking the walk .
please adopt a more fundamental policy on this issue .
... active dialogue between the council member should also be pursued between session .
the human right council is on the right track here .
social , cultural , civil and political right on an equal footing .
i would like to stress this and to commend you for this .
well , firstly you stressed the universality of human right .
i am very pleased that we are on the same wavelength .
there is a chance that a regional council will be established .
six million jew were murdered in the second world war here in europe .
yesterday wa woman 's day . this wa not raised here .
it voted down an amendment not to fund infanticide .
how in the name of god could we vote down something like that ?
when are we going to be able to discus this issue ?
it is not a taboo subject ; this is a democracy .
it is more than i received from her in relation to my view .
please let u have respectful debate in this house .
mr president , of course i respect mr mitchell 's view .
i am not an ogre ; i am not something from the past .
i thank the member for what they have said .
the climate in which the council meeting is taking place is particularly delicate .
to make this possible , we will need to act quickly .
however , it would be unfair to single out just libya .
the 3 400 people there are suffering psychological torture .
i hear the criticism that are made of it .
on goldstone , we are trying to engage to find a consensual resolution .
that is what we are doing at the present time .
i apologise that i did not answer on camp ashraf .
i intended to , but i turned the paper over too quickly .
they assure me that the basic need are being met .
we do indeed - hence i know about the weekly report .
i talked with the team while i wa in geneva .
i have had no discussion with anybody about doing this at the moment .
the vote will take place at midday on thursday , 10 march .
there is no practical alternative to eu value-based foreign policy .
it is a rough derision of democracy and human right .
state of play of the peace process for the middle east ( debate )
i also believe the european union ha an important role in this process .
the only viable choice is a negotiated outcome on all final status issue .
i chaired the quartet meeting in munich on 5 february .
i urge and hope that this will happen soon .
the right to live freely is something that must be universally recognised .
thus , i do not want to criticise you , baroness ashton .
we all know very well that time is now running out .
that wa excellent and i would like to express my thanks for that .
this is , in fact , a very serious matter .
why is it that all we hear about is money ?
we have paid and paid , and that is important .
twenty nine people were killed , many hundred were injured .
however , the european union can behave differently ; it can behave correctly .
egypt and other arab country now have the opportunity of democratic development .
we must refrain from everything that is a hindrance to this peace .
now is not the time for pusillanimity and tentative dealing .
i am pleased that israel ha not intervened in internal arab development .
( de ) mr president , the contrast is striking !
in recent day and week , we have discussed egypt and tunisia .
you occasionally have to endure criticism from this house , too .
for this reason , some praise is perhaps also in order .
it is merely that these change have not yet come to an end .
there is a consensus among all group in this house on that point .
the situation in the palestinian territory is in no way simple .
wholesale change are taking place in the middle east .
past experience have seen political vacuum filled by hamas and hezbollah .
we must also admit that the neighbourhood policy ha failed .
we currently spend eur 1.5 billion per year on this policy .
can you confirm whether that will be the case ?
we must reject the racist stereotype that regard them a a threat .
high representative , you have the power to make a difference .
is it surprising that palestinian regard the european union a having double standard ?
but israel just think we are weak , weak , weak .
we must do the same for the ark royal .
we should make the most of this type of opportunity .
naturally , the safe bet for everyone would be to wait and see .
it ha helped civil society in the middle east .
let u hope that the muslim brotherhood do not prevail in cairo .
iran also constitutes a threat to the very existence of israel .
egypt getting closer to iran is a very alarming trend .
i do not criticise member here for saying it .
i will be speaking to him soon about that among many other thing .
i am not sure whether the election will now go ahead .
i know that they are thinking about the best way forward .
you also asked me about the leak that occurred from the palestinian side .
one is , of course , great concern about what wa going on .
so it had an interesting effect on raising the debate .
this could be a really important part of a secure , stable region .
it is very important that the palestinian can carry the people with them .
i am trying to make sure that we make progress on that .
i feel very strongly that we have played an important part .
i do not mind where we meet the envoy .
we can do it and we are ready to roll .
so that is my particular reference for kerem shalom .
the budget for the european external action service is eur 460 million .
it is le than 50 % of the british foreign office 's budget .
we talk about the opportunity that we have there .
so i think it is the moment where we can really make change .
i want to just say something about the relationship that we have .
they will tell me about thing they do not like .
i can not do what other country can do .
m dodds asked whether the neighbourhood policy had failed .
i said a long time ago that we need to review the policy .
finally , mr swoboda , you asked me about the iranian ship .
permission wa given for it to go through on that basis .
whether that wa what wa happening or not is another thing altogether .
honourable member , thank you very much for this debate .
the management of drinking water is one example of this .
on the contrary , they are an opportunity to be seized .
the eu must take the initiative to relaunch them .
why not do so within the context of the union for the mediterranean ?
medium law in hungary ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
respect of national wage and retirement-setting mechanism ( debate )
it is not eu action in the respective field .
we know , however , that recovery can not happen without pain .
ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s .
we must prune the tree in order to allow growth .
we do not need the straw to break the camel 's back .
i do not believe that this interference can be justified .
the treaty requires the commission to promote social dialogue , not undermine it .
the people will reject the idea of a europe based only on austerity .
why is it that one euro wa deducted from the minimum wage ?
finally my main question , commissioner , is : who decides ?
wage policy is not the business of the eu .
this is like a blind man describing an elephant .
people who write such thing have no understanding of collective agreement system .
we need measure to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy , not punitive measure .
i am not surprised : this is the eu at work .
commissioner , you have the same nationality a me .
what did the supposedly extremely pro-european force do at that time ?
they said 'this country is a wonderful example ' .
commissioner , you say that the member state is committing itself to this .
we then need clear benchmark that actually apply to everyone .
in our view , there is no contradiction here .
it is not supported by practice on the ground .
you may be unhappy with that , but that is going to happen .
this will continue the fight against these antisocial policy .
how ha the general feeling towards the eu changed ?
the european union , the commission and the council ...
the european commission ha quite simply redrawn the map .
this is what the dispute is about and it ha only just begun .
this is surely not what it is all about .
this is the prescription which is being given consistently to every patient .
you recently visited greece , during an event organised by the socialist party .
i beg you to include social indicator alongside the economic indicator .
that will make the people of europe really very unhappy .
commissioner , you gave your opinion on the memorandum of understanding with ireland .
in other word , we should do the opposite .
it is not obvious that we can achieve this alignment .
the clear disparity can be seen between romania and germany .
this is due to the difference in quality of economic policy over time .
indeed , such discrepancy can not be made up overnight .
my country ha made effort towards reforming pension and social assistance .
in romania , the gross national minimum wage is approximately eur 160 .
these proposal are downright unfair , to say the very least .
the feeling is that pay flexibility might help in some way .
it will not : on the contrary , it will result in deflation .
pension have been reduced , along with the minimum tax-free amount .
i can promise you that we give serious consideration to each of them .
we fully recognise the importance of social dialogue and constructive industrial relation .
moreover , that provision doe not create subjective right for the social partner .
the provision of title 10 , social policy , can not be disregarded .
they provide for condition linked to the granting of union assistance .
this is explicitly allowed by article 122 ( 2 ) .
therefore , there is no legal problem a regard the principle of conferral .
two year later , and where is this list ?
this report put forward a set of important recommendation .
which step have already been taken in this area ?
we all know that investing in disaster prevention pay off .
we are now assessing the effectiveness of existing eu financing instrument .
action are also under way to improve our knowledge of disaster .
we also need clear and transparent assessment of the risk we face .
developing fully-fledged risk management policy will require the involvement of all actor .
the second keyword that we must mention here is speed .
mr president , this is a recurring debate in parliament .
unfortunately , natural or man-made disaster are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating .
there are certain community instrument to support this disaster prevention activity .
moreover , the funding mechanism also need to be improved .
we need to know where the trained emergency service team are .
the commission must come forward with these plan now .
tomorrow 's disaster may be just around the corner .
how can we maintain a fund to deal with increasingly drastic exceptional situation ?
many people actually suffered serious health problem caused by this smoke .
the author ha already mentioned the idea of providing some assurance for agriculture .
the international day for natural disaster reduction is a good example of this .
i also think that all the instrument need to be made more effective ...
commissioner , my fellow member have highlighted this matter very well .
i know it ha not been applied properly in my country .
country have to take responsibility just the same a the commission .
by working together , we can at least alleviate the difficulty .
we need to prepare for the proper and effective application of this clause .
discussion to this effect are also ongoing within the commission .
the situation is different with regard to technological disaster , for example .
of this , around 20 % ha already been allocated to specific project .
in practice , that often result in delay in the implementation of project .
the party involved must be trained in effective crisis management using simulation exercise .
to be frank , mr president , member state bottled it last year .
do we have a comprehensive plan to cover the next volcanic eruption ?
should this happen , will member state coordinate at eu level in future ?
i will now try to change my speech somewhat .
it wa indeed chaos - mr simpson ha already said that .
we realised that there were too few agreement in place .
have all of the international expert on such volcanic eruption actually been consulted ?
there is also something else that cause me concern .
that can , of course , help in such case .
some passenger were stranded and were unable to continue their journey .
perhaps we should also revise these passenger right once more .
you will notice that this subject is of great concern to u .
in principle , of course , this ha it basis in law .
this make europe a stronger partner at a global level .
this process must be repeated when important change occur .
this must be reflected in the safety risk assessment .
the volcanic ash crisis highlighted the crucial importance of the single european sky .
another important factor a far a we are concerned is the passenger .
it is not just a question of explaining their right .
we will then be able to regulate this within twelve month .
but i wa , like others , a victim of the ash cloud .
i wa travelling to baku and could only get back with great difficulty .
however , safety must remain the guiding principle for the future , too .
for example , how about improving our common measuring system ?
this egotism damage european cooperation and , ultimately , also the european idea .
in all this chaos , one thing wa clear .
let u hope that we move forward now in a positive way .
we need and must achieve greater progress in this area .
i would ask the commission to look at this a well .
when will there be an effective common european airspace ?
we therefore have to get european airport to work properly too .
this is an issue that the commission need be more effective on .
i can not understand the criticism directed at the airline .
they clearly suffered a loss - a figure of 2 billion wa mentioned .
that decision must be made at a political level .
imagine if an aeroplane had crashed a a result of the volcanic ash .
it must also be the case in the future , too .
each of u in this chamber wa directly affected .
i think that is the overlying situation that we should support .
meanwhile , air traffic over europe continues to increase year-on-year .
after all , they have put their signature to it .
we have regulation ( ec ) no 2061 from 2004 .
what doe the commission intend to do in this regard ?
i therefore consider it necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach .
unfortunately , there is no suitable medicine for such a situation .
this would certainly be effective in helping resolve problem of this kind .
it is almost impossible these day to obtain information without the internet .
we should work together to resolve this issue , too .
therefore , i would like to conclude by stating the following .
it showed the importance of centralised european action in a widespread crisis situation .
this will be of benefit to all citizen in europe .
it is our intention to revise air passenger right in 2012 .
therefore , they must be provided with accurate data .
it caused major economic loss and directly affected 10 million passenger .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:35 and resumed at 12:00 )
they strike in place where ordinary people should feel safe in their country .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
to begin with , i am going to read you two written declaration .
it ha been signed by the majority of parliament 's component member .
it ha been signed by the majority of parliament 's component member .
together , we were able to collect a majority of signature .
must we become a theatre for settling national political score ?
lady and gentleman , the proposal is completely clear .
if you do so , that is your business .
freedom of the medium is an inviolable element of democracy .
we want democracy and we want freedom of the medium .
mr president , we have been addressed specifically here .
of course , we have confidence in commissioner kroes 's work .
all of these are matter that still need to be discussed .
southern neighbourhood , and libya in particular , including humanitarian aspect (
mr gomes , do you have a specific amendment in mind ?
now we are trying to include something which happened only yesterday .
i will read the text in english and then i will explain why :
it is sure to give u a great boost in our work .
so there wa a misunderstanding over the voting instruction .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
in my opinion , that ought to have been enough .
madam president , i voted , of course , for this resolution .
madam president , i voted in favour of the resolution .
we also need to retain the option of military intervention in this situation .
there are poster up all over benghazi saying so .
we have made quite enough problem for ourselves by our intervention to date .
it is not enough , however , to adopt a resolution .
they burned two church and prevented fire-fighters from entering the village .
the army did not want to interfere at first .
the 12 000 christian living in the village were placed under a curfew .
the only winner in such an eventuality would be mr ahmadinejad .
unfortunately , this human right resolution wa not wellbalanced .
we are all aware of the situation in the middle east at present .
the european commission ha done some fine work here .
i therefore assume that the european parliament will actively contribute to this .
democracy is by no mean a matter of fact .
it evolves , progress and , unfortunately , also regress over time .
the independence of medium governance and freedom of expression are not negotiable .
the european commission should now continually monitor the application of the law .
for this reason , the ecr group ha abstained .
all cause which lead to such a negative result should be examined .
possibly the hungarian government wa inspired by latvian 'independence ' .
i voted 'for ' in the hope that the ice ha broken up .
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution .
swift and effective humanitarian action is needed from the eu and the un .
the united nation itself ha rightly condemned the atrocity that have been committed .
the european union can not alienate itself from what is happening .
we do not know when or how the civil war will end .
it should also encourage libyan to make change and to move towards democracy .
i call for full respect of human right in the region .
any other development would necessitate a different text and different provision .
today , the cynicism of some eu leader cause a sensation of disgust !
however , this paragraph may be subject to various interpretation .
to others , it is the first step towards possible military intervention .
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution .
human right and fundamental right continue to be violated with impunity in iran .
numerous iranian were executed for political reason and untold number remain in prison .
the eu should support international diplomacy for the protection of human right .
should the european union not support all defender of human right in iran ?
the current push for democracy in north africa should be extended to iran .
the report also highlight the repression of christian and the baha'i community .
in view of this , i voted in favour .
( the sitting wa suspended at 12:55 and resumed at 15:00 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
pakistan - murder of shahbaz bhatti , minister for minority
the whole population is suffering , and intimidation is undermining democracy in pakistan .
so we expect leadership in pakistan and in the european union .
we need practical action such a investigation , including within the government .
today in parliament , we are debating the circumstance of his death .
only about a month ago , i met mr bhatti .
he understood very well what bravery could lead to .
mr president , i am afraid the situation in pakistan is getting worse .
however , the time ha come for u to put our foot down .
that is not only in the interest of the west .
there is very little time left to reverse that tide .
i think there are a number of important point in this resolution .
his funeral wa last week and i think that is also important .
investigation take year and are based on discriminatory law .
why wa mr bhatti not shadowed by armed close protection officer ?
this is one of the many question we must ask president zardari .
we send our condolence to his loved one in their hour of grief .
i am certain we should speak out about this .
that would clearly signal a united stand against extremism .
our respect go to mr jamali for attending mr bhatti 's funeral .
they have also led to miscarriage of justice and discrimination against religious minority .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
unfortunately , our current policy ha not brought the expected result .
i hope we will be able to increase the scale of that support .
le than two month later , another tragedy ha come to pas .
such negligence by the authority make them an accomplice to the killing .
belarus , in particular the case of ale michalevic and natalia radin
the rule of law need to be adhered to .
today , i would like , from here , to send three message .
we should say to our belarusian brother today that they are not alone .
on the same day , ale mikhalevich celebrated his 53rd birthday in prison .
i also propose reopening the osce office in belarus .
those arrested include one of the presidential candidate , ale mikhalevich .
journalist close to the opposition were also targeted at the same time .
i do not dispute the need to engage with the lukashenko regime .
all these despicable event may call for an update of our eu response .
this wa a very clear and strong message of condemnation to the authority .
it is now time to reflect on whether an additional response is needed .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .
situation and cultural heritage in kashgar ( xinjiang uyghur autonomous region , china )
they need international support to preserve their culture and identity .
particularly disturbing are the report of the reconstruction of the city of kashgar .
it is closer to baghdad than it is to beijing .
perhaps very little , but at least highlighting it here today is important .
the entire xinjiang region ha enormous cultural significance for the entire world .
kashgar is a fundamental pillar of the history of islam in china .
mr president , cultural heritage is crucial to preserving identity .
china should make a concessionary gesture in this regard .
international relation can indeed provide a great deal of help here .
the city therefore attracts hundred and thousand of tourist a year .
the vote will take place at the end of the debate .

government which use gun against their own citizen lose all democratic legitimacy .
the violence must be halted , and those responsible put on trial .
we are meeting again this evening to continue our discussion .
i will keep you informed of development a they happen .
( fr ) mr president , i fully approve of your severity .
i think what ha happened deserves to be praised .
it is the opinion of the entire european parliament .
we are opposed to the action of our former fellow member .
i believe that zero tolerance applies to all member of this house .
i spoke , too , of the terrible suffering .
there wa also a brief discussion on the subject .
the whole interpretation ha been made available for your inspection .
nevertheless , all of you do have access to this interpretation .
mr soullie ha resigned from parliament with effect from 24 march 2011 .
we do not see him - he is not here .
at that time , he wa appointed minister of the interior .
brice hortefeux wa elected a a member of the european parliament .
you are the one asking me to observe the law .
it can not give it verdict without a proposal .
let me say again : let u think before we act .
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
( for result and other detail of the vote : see minute )
it is entirely appropriate to review the stability and growth pact .
furthermore , i disagree with the choice of the simplified treaty revision procedure .
discussion , participation and democracy fall by the wayside .
the ordinary treaty revision procedure should have been required for the esm .
we are privatising ( speculative ) profit and socialising the loss .
the public sector is lending money to the bank here .
in writing . - i abstained throughout the voting on this report .
furthermore i disagree with the choice of the simplified treaty revision procedure .
consequently , i voted in favour of this report .
the proposed change pave the way for social dialogue to be torpedoed .
this wa a decision that naturally no one wa pleased about .
i sincerely hope that similar decision will not have to be made often .
i supported this highly realistic and constructive solution with my vote .
ideally this mechanism should have been incorporated into the community system .
however , i do not think that the debate stop here .
i refer , for example , to the matter of eurobonds .
in writing . - according to the report voted today , the ep :
furthermore i disagree with the choice of the simplified treaty revision procedure .
furthermore we disagree with the choice of the simplified treaty revision procedure .
the union 's economic governance is gradually becoming a reality .
it required the european stability mechanism ( esm ) to be made permanent .
i share this view of many of my fellow member .
however , freedom must always go hand in hand with responsibility .
preparation for the european council meeting ( 24-25 march 2011 ) ( debate )
this achievement enables the presidency to start negotiation with this parliament .
four out of the six proposal are subject to codecision .
so we have a common responsibility with the european parliament in this matter .
a you see , real progress ha been made in combating the crisis .
let me turn now to libya and the southern neighbourhood .
so what kind of action ha the council taken ?
let me announce a third element : a third round of sanction .
the hungarian presidency put the question of emergency supply security on the agenda .
they agreed that the eu ha sufficient oil and gas stock .
now the situation is under control , thanks to the egyptian authority .
i am sorry if my speech wa a bit too long .
for that we also need to improve the business environment .
we also have to do more to foster employment .
we need more labour mobility , not le mobility .
a healthy banking system is a prerequisite for a sustainable economic recovery .
inevitably , all these situation are having repercussion for u here in europe .
our fellow citizen have witnessed japan 's drama unfolding live .
this is a subject we will be returning to during our next part-session .
the community method must remain the rule and the intergovernmental method the exception .
the pact for the euro should also be adopted on friday .
i can not share your cheerfulness ahead of this summit .
a year ago people said 'the greek should deal with it themselves .
the amount we have made available is enough . '
four month later : 'we need more money ' .
eurobonds will come - of that i am quite sure .
i also do not know whether we have yet rescued the community method .
i hope so and we support you in it , mr barroso .
the euro enjoys confidence , and likewise we have confidence in the euro .
that is the problem that we are grappling with in europe .
on it introduction the euro wa worth usd 1.17 .
that is the reality with which we are confronted .
i hope that everything will go well at the weekend .
i hope that what you have announced will be implemented .
i hope that we will come back from a successful summit .
this is the first thing i wanted to say .
this wa our first reaction in the eu body .
thirdly , look at what we are witnessing now .
some outrageous decision have been made within the eu institution .
they are telling them to stay calm and be careful .
parliament , unfortunately , ha been playing a very active role in that .
this ha all gone too far and must be stopped .
national leader , not eu leader , have shown international leadership .
this is a valid for foreign policy a it is for economic policy .
yes , we need to halt the race towards insecurity and greater inequality .
they know that these radical change are also complex .
we always start by making the labour market more flexible .
our citizen are fed up with the double standard behind this policy .
we have seen how useless the previous stress test were .
the problem is that politics doe not seem to have made much progress .
in fact , no new political concept are in sight .
that is not the same a a sustainable budget .
if there is no consumption , then production will also collapse .
this mean speeding up the policy of economic governance in europe .
madam president-in-office of the council , mr verhofstadt is absolutely right .
the pact for the euro involves too little community method .
that ha been said here , and quite rightly so .
i would like to say a final word about libya .
i would like to warn those who want to hurry .
at least , that is what i see happens on europe 's road .
( nl ) madam president , i thought that you had overlooked me .
that pact ha been breached by germany , france , greece and others .
those country , madam president , should leave the eurozone .
it is true : this is the fourth package in a few month .
this is not because the previous one were not observed : they were .
all the member state have to submit their austerity plan up to april .
you refused to negotiate , but you presented no alternative .
we have managed to stop colonel gaddafi from reaching benghazi .
however , europe 's lack of unity is worrying .
history is on the move in much of the world .
the german writer han enzensberger correctly foresaw what would happen .
the problem , however , is with the implementation of these well-intentioned rule .
mr president , i want to consider two issue .
a new architecture is being born , almost a kind of economic schengen .
any non-euro member state could have the same public finance problem .
so there is a lack of logic and a lack of consistency .
a few word on libya and the southern mediterranean .
in this respect , it is a shame that the process stopped halfway .
well , 24 march see the birth of the 'brussels consensus ' .
there wa no explosion of public expenditure in europe : quite the contrary .
none of u want further crisis , but they could happen .
the situation in libya and within the international community is confused .
in this respect , thing are close to exceeding the threshold of war .
france and britain - two nation state - took the lead .
germany , apparently , is a country of hard currency and soft power .
the only politician who knew how to deal with gaddafi wa ronald reagan .
there is a sea change under way in the arab world .
we condemn this in the strongest possible term , whoever is responsible .
they say that it is better to be outside the euro area .
denmark and the danish government and parliament are in favour of the euro .
it should be possible for sweden to be so , too .
the interest in providing humanitarian aid is disgraceful hypocrisy .
this is the european union of democracy and freedom .
everything happening in portugal wa foreseen by the psd during the 2009 election .
i took part in that campaign and we warned that this would happen .
it is to this that i should like an answer .
is it not lust for power leading them to take this attitude ?
why do you not support the solution proposed , right here and now ?
finally , i would like to turn to the euro pact .
i think that we have , indeed , taken important step forward .
however , we have a new government and new hope in ireland .
however , there are two thing we need in particular to do that .
firstly , the interest rate charged is draconian and is not sustainable .
three , we will also consider a european independent fiscal agency .
it is also a challenge for the entire international community .
we should remember this advice and be careful to heed it .
i believe that the key word should be 'coordination ' and 'clarity ' .
the next eu summit can further strengthen this process .
this may enable the whole of european integration to enter a new phase .
the whole of europe may lose if there is a delay .
i congratulate mr brok and mr gualtieri on today 's report .
this is a mechanism that will try to make water flow uphill !
the first is that many of the measure are undemocratic by nature .
secondly , many of the proposed measure are counter-productive .
how doe the commission intend to restore economic growth and employment ?
you are proposing policy which suppress domestic demand and rely on export .
it brought new hope a well that innocent civilian life would be spared .
reinforced economic governance is indeed the cornerstone of our comprehensive response .
this is what we must put an end to .
thus this in itself wa a positive message for the market .
i believe that we have made considerable progress since 4 february .
so , we have come a long way and in a positive direction .
a condition for this wa the start of democratic change .
by then , un security council resolution 1973 wa available .
respect for the social consultation model is central to this pact .
in particular , we need to focus on cross-border investment in renewable energy .
everybody know that the key to european economic growth is employment .
however , our citizen can not be burdened with a further structural crisis .
the energy mix still come under the remit of the member state .
this european council is taking place in a specific context for portugal .
situation in japan , including the nuclear power plant alert ( debate )
we have already provided japan with assistance in a very concrete way .
the eu civil protection team deployed in japan ha our full support .
there are certain lesson to be learned from this accident .
this is why it is important to involve neighbouring third country .
once again , i salute their courage and determination .
we are assessing what lesson we should learn from this for europe .
this is only an offer ; acceptance is voluntary .
i have had a long telephone conversation with the ukrainian energy minister .
it show that there is a high level of support .
we should discus this with the calmness that it demand .
however , the disaster also demonstrates the vulnerability of all modern society .
now , of course , we can not simply imagine nuclear power away .
some are building new nuclear power plant and some are decommissioning them .
furthermore , authority should not be allowed to audit themselves .
radical measure might be necessary - i would think are necessary .
we must remember the extraordinary strength of the earthquake and of the tsunami .
every child in japan is aware of the consequence of nuclear meltdown .
we should be aware of this when we come to discus japan .
we need to do everything we can to help the japanese people .
the humanitarian disaster show the importance of moving towards a non-nuclear europe .
there must be a review of the nuclear safety regulatory system a well .
of course , this requires there to be sufficient facility nearby .
the titanic wa built to be an unsinkable ship .
'even god could not sink it ' wa what wa said about it .
there might be one in california , in italy or in the caribbean .
it is important for the world to learn from this experience .
this is particularly pertinent in my ireland east constituency .
our second response should concern the future of nuclear power a a whole .
the earthquake and the tsunami have caused unimaginable destruction .
what is more , this idea of low carbon technology is simply wrong .
one need to look at the overall risk from all technology .
that is the very least that the citizen of europe can expect .
we needed a second round of stress test to get thing right .
otherwise you run the risk of hearing only biased opinion .
i would be a little more circumspect if i were you .
radiation from the nuclear power plant in fukushima is rising dramatically .
that is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy .
all member state should exercise strict and total control over these power plant .
( fr ) madam president , a few word on japan .
we are expecting the european union to redefine it strategy on this issue .
it is possible to run europe entirely on sustainable power .
that should be the subject of our debate today .
being for or against nuclear energy is a matter of political choice .
we should not have to justify why we are against nuclear energy .
i have two question for you , mr oettinger , two important question .
first of all : how are we going to establish the criterion ?
how are we going to ensure they are independent ?
we recently adopted an energy strategy for europe up to 2020 .
we say there that it should simply be accompanied by stringent safety condition .
europe 's entire energy strategy is based on decentralisation and diversification .
that wa true before the incident in japan and it remains true now .
we learn lesson ; we apply them , and we improve safety .
that is what we must do with the nuclear industry .
that is why our discussion must not be ideological .
did the responsibility , implementation and supervision system collapse ?
wa the safety culture in one of the nuclear plant weak ?
what are the option for storing spent nuclear fuel more safely ?
we need to ensure the 'safety first ' principle is implemented .
finally , i would like to mention the common safety criterion .
the commission 's proposal to organise broad european consultation is to be welcomed .
the japanese people 's behaviour is exemplary and set a precedent for u .
those nuclear worker should be involved whose dedication and knowledge are indispensable .
we must therefore learn important lesson from what is happening in fukushima .
we should consider a europe-wide phase-out and promote renewable energy .
the general issue at stake here is disaster response .
our government ha announced a significant change of direction .
seven nuclear power station have currently been taken offline in germany .
it ha been said that i need to 'act decisively ' .
i have always felt comfortable on the middle ground .
i am not the right person to deal with on that score .
you are welcome to make your view known when others come to speak .
i do not regard the treaty of lisbon a set in stone .
yet , a we have heard , they have diametrically opposed position .
part of the process is always global in nature .
it is very important that we draw conclusion and learn lesson .
this need to be elaborated and an appropriate proposal tabled .
there is no need to hurry but naturally the work must start .
commissioner oettinger also pointed out that the energy mix is a national competence .
indeed , we still have much to do in this area .
let u make science serve people and the maximum safety of people .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( thursday , 24 march 2011 ) .
the question is merely when and where they will happen .
fossil fuel resource are exhaustible and renewable energy is still very much experimental .
the problem of the damaged fukushima plant almost overshadow everything else .
the greatest threat to humanity is the military nuclear arsenal .
i would like to comment on the situation in japan .
therefore it is essential to have permanent and highly developed international cooperation .
this aid must be given continuously until the situation in japan stabilises .
the time ha come when we have to take up this important role .
i hope the upcoming european council will agree to take the appropriate decision .
establishment of a joint eu resettlement programme ( debate )
how much of a priority are refugee for the council ?
a year later we are still waiting for the council .
the co-decision process ha transformed into a co-indecision process .
i believe that we have agreement across all the group in parliament .
europe is being called upon to play a leading role in the mediterranean .
i visited the tunisian-libyan border at the beginning of march .
the international aid organisation on the spot were looking after them .
the primary purpose of his visit wa to learn about the refugee situation .
he went to the border and met egyptian official there .
the situation there , on this section , ha changed now .
the hungarian presidency is committed to advancing the proposal in the refugee package .
then , too , i replied to meps ' question .
the position of the council and the commission is identical on this .
the union a a whole must help these country .
refugee resettlement is not the same a burden sharing .
one figure : there are more than 10 million refugee in the world .
these are vulnerable people , woman at risk , child and unaccompanied minor .
mr győri , this can not wait until 2012 .
the latter must meet an imperative need , that of our world today .
please , council , let u get on with this .
the resettlement of iraqi refugee in the eu ha shown that it work .
however , the number of iraqi refugee accepted wa ridiculously small .
these are instrument that are in place but are being not used .
this , i must add , is only the short-term effect .
why , there are one or two member from the liberal group here .
we have the feeling that this , in fact , is not important .
hence i would like to know more on this .
we need to show increased solidarity with these country and with their population .
tunisia and egypt have agreed to open their border to those fleeing libya .
the capacity of the member state to take these people vary considerably .
the matter of resettlement is one of our important tool in this regard .
i therefore believe that these figure speak for themselves .
we are therefore endeavouring to accelerate the legislative work .
i would like to state that this is a very important question .
the treaty doe not draw a clear line between the individual act .
i think that we should not yet be imagining thing .
it seems to me that everyone is in control of the situation .
repatriation , which is the most urgent issue , is proceeding .
this doe not mean that there is no need for the legislation .
author . - mr president , my comment is methodological in nature .
u subpoena and eu data protection rule ( debate )
the european union generally respect the court proceeding of third country .
the relevant tftp agreement wa approved by parliament in july 2010 .
so what are we going to do about this ?
i am counting on parliament to help this happen .
the fact is that we , naturally , respect u law .
this ha huge implication for the right to privacy of all eu citizen .
i know that you are working on that aim .
this is a genuine and ongoing concern of eu citizen .
i am pleased to note that they share our concern .
will they talk to our american counterpart and try and get more information ?
there are probably other company that have been subpoenaed .
at the same time , they have requested large amount of ...
this is particularly the case when it come to personal data .
we are not being short-sighted here , just pragmatic .
mr president , contemporary terrorism is dominated by islamic terrorism .
i have been writing a report for my committee on this issue .
there is good news regarding relation with our american counterpart .
i say this not out of politeness , but out of sincere gratitude .
we saw this more clearly than ever during the euro crisis .
that is why this directive aim to protect consumer .
we are prepared to make every effort necessary to this end .
i believe it is high time for the co-legislators to find a solution .
the council agreed on a general approach at the beginning of the year .
i know that , by your amendment , you seek additional improvement .
i will do what i can to help you reach such a compromise .
our committee would really like to make progress in that area .
i hope we will keep talking , that we will keep discussing .
the commission 's proposal left quite a lot of room for improvement .
it is good that digital good are included in the proposal .
these are positive improvement that have enabled u to lend our support .
mr president , lady and gentleman , this text is important .
obviously , all this is going to upset a few habit .
i welcomed the openness that ha just been shown in this respect .
consumer ' confidence in the union 's internal market is very fragile .
i would like to highlight some of the most important matter .
there are two especially important element in parliament 's proposal for the directive .
we are satisfied that this wa taken into account .
everyone is used to downloading content from the net free of charge .
what is needed here is a legal right of withdrawal .
i am convinced that common rule are win-win for consumer and business .
throughout the process the ppe group ha been flexible and constructive .
i believe instead that the common interest of the european people should prevail .
the parliamentary passage of this report is not over , therefore .
that is what consumer ' association at national and european level told u .
i think all colleague are in tune with that .
i think that ha been one of the biggest problem we have faced .
he probably know better than anyone that it wa not an easy task .
we should therefore guarantee that regulation protecting consumer are clear and transparent .
it ha been difficult to discus this sensibly in parliament .
one of the two case concern distance sale contract .
in my opinion , this part of the proposal is superfluous .
that is why i consider that minimum harmonisation is the right working basis .
the principle wa simple : no harmonisation without an equivalent level of protection .
the solution is of course more europe , but not any kind .
consumer protection is really not against the interest of honest businessmen .
a developed consumer protection policy is also a mean of supporting smes .
undoubtedly it ha been a great achievement on their part .
( ga ) i commend mr schwab for bringing the work to completion .
of course it is a compromise , it is not perfect .
it is also important for u to protect consumer against unfair contractual term .
it is to my satisfaction that mr schwab prepared such an excellent report .
the single internal market requires single european consumer rule .
it is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading .
let me address some specific question that were raised in the debate .
many have urged for the regulation of the list of unfair contract term .
fuller harmonisation at this stage would not have been possible .
a compromise is always an opportunity to achieve a balance between different interest .
this is why i believe that we are on the right track .
i welcome what is being done to strengthen consumer right in the eu .
such measure can greatly increase red tape and the unnecessary administrative burden .
consumer and business encounter obstacle in relation to the difference in market condition .
it is these contract that account for the greatest number of cross-border transaction .
some of these are often deficient and unsatisfactory from a legal perspective .
thirty-three per cent would be interested in buying cross-border .
i very much welcome improved right for consumer purchasing online .
i welcome the harmonisation of the right of withdrawal within 14 day .
i fully support the rapporteur 's effort to balance this .
the eu and it member state have to focus on both .
i therefore support the rapporteur 's proposal to this effect .
full consumer protection legislation is still not a reality in the european union .
nevertheless , this is a big step towards better consumer protection and trade .
we therefore need to make sme-friendly amendment to the commission proposal .
what is the difference between the internet and the supermarket ?
this lead to abuse in term of passenger service and service supply .
on the face of it , this look like a very technical issue .
we know that around 20 % of greenhouse gas emission come from transport .
that brings me to this question of tar sand and oil shale .
i said at the beginning that this is not just a technical issue .
these report are available on the commission 's website .
therefore , i am calling on the commission to act quickly .
the question , commissioner , is when will this procedure be completed ?
in fact , the problem with tar sand is not just the emission .
nevertheless the lack of progress ha been deeply frustrating .
it really doe feel like timewasting on a grand scale .
this result in land degradation , deforestation and the exploitation of water resource .
the european commission should support such requirement and technology for reducing co2 emission .
for this reason , this is an important initiative .
one of the photograph really chill you to the bone .
we have become used to valuing everything in term of money .
it also give developing country trade concession on a whole range of product .
the deadline for this proposal wa 1 june 2010 .
it is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way .
you need an impact assessment , which take time .
you could even ask yourself what the use of such a system is .
we will come forward with our proposal within a couple of month .
parliament will then have the possibility to discus them with u thoroughly .
we really did not want to create any legal problem .
to increase the efficiency of the system ; 2 .
the gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion .
i would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach .
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the most recent example is the tragic situation in japan .
it is a struggle for which we feel combative and committed solidarity .
for instance , the level of corruption must be monitored for candidate country .
some of them may be of a financial nature .
mr president , we were discussing consumer right earlier on .
however , the bekaa valley is a stronghold of the islamist hezbollah movement .
i would like to draw your attention to one such case .
it is up to u to clean up the remaining ruin .
it increase the number of compulsory subject taught in lithuanian .
eu relation with the gulf cooperation council ( short presentation )
finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition .
obviously , this report also outline long-term strategic prospect .
from a geopolitical point of view , iran clearly represents a genuine threat .
let u remember that they are behind the arab peace initiative .
i believe it is essential that we strengthen economic relation .
within the limit of our discussion tonight this is especially true of bahrain .
the question for u is : where doe all this lead to ?
how should we read your report against the backdrop of these event ?
your report call for more contact and not le and i agree .
a trade commissioner i would welcome better opportunity for exchange between businesspeople .
europe firmly belief that reform must come from within .
a free trade agreement mean fewer barrier to mutual cooperation and trade .
i therefore support such an agreement , in principle .
some of the state represented in the gulf cooperation council have two face .
finally , however , we succeeded in adopting it .
this will ensure better observance of existing employee right by airline .
the agreement contains provision for opening the market in phase .
i would like to mention a few point about this report .
we therefore obviously call on the european parliament to ratify this agreement .
all three have been strongly supported by the committee on transport and tourism .
let me now turn to the agreement with canada .
it is done through a phased market opening in four phase .
currently , we have negotiated 45 such horizontal agreement with partner country worldwide .
for u , technical harmonisation is also an important point .
this will make negotiation on these agreement much simpler .
we have a number of very different agreement on the table today .
the most comprehensive agreement is the one with canada .
now we are about to enter stage 3 and 4 .
indeed , after several year it wa rather overdue .
obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed .
it facilitates economic growth , trade , investment and tourism .
finally , can we just add our support to the eu-vietnam agreement .
however , the agreement with canada is more ambitious , which i welcome .
the situation concerning the agreement with the usa is quite different .
much too little ha been done in this area .
this is a mistake and i want to be very clear on this .
in addition , regulatory convergence could promote fair competition .
the ambitious nature of this agreement is very much to be welcomed .
it should serve a a target for other negotiation currently underway .
i therefore believe that parliament should consent to the eu-canada air transport agreement .
this will make it easier to guarantee parliament 's support for the agreement .
for the first time , the agreement also address labour relation .
the possibility of a one-stop system must remain open .
the committee on transport and the commission have themselves pointed this out .
there are 31 time fewer accident amongst holder of u licence .
the agreement mark an important phase in the process of opening the market .
the agreement also set out mutual standard for safety and security .
it is an important agreement for the eu and our aviation sector .
it will allow increased competition , greater choice for the travelling public .
this mean that both the worker and the passenger lose out .
i can assure you that this is far from being the end .
we must negotiate and we have to take into account their concern .
i promise that we will keep you informed about all future development .
we were not able to amend this document for procedural reason .
lady and gentleman , my work on this document is not yet complete .
madam president , we welcome the ambitious nature of this agreement .
it should provide an objective and model for other negotiation currently in progress .
in conclusion , i recommend parliament to approve the eu-canada air transport agreement .
these are big , important goal , but they are also very specific .
mathematical , general and indiscriminate increase are of no use at all .
the context of financial consolidation is obvious to everybody .
national budgeting is mainly about social transfer , about consumption .
i believe that the 2012 budget will be crucial in answering that question .
in time like these it is no easy task to set budgetary priority .
i think we should take mr balzani 's approach very seriously .
the 2012 european budget must also make a contribution in this area .
it also mean more unemployment and more social regression .
given his track record today , i will not be holding my breath .
my third point concern climate change and energy target .
i should like to touch on two fundamental matter .
austerity is not a principle , it is an instrument .
i believe that this is not an austerity policy at all .
that can not be what social democrat are aiming for .
let u consider for a moment how the member state spend european fund .
that is also happening for example in germany and the united kingdom .
( da ) madam president , i would like to thank mr balzani .
it is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency .
we must find funding for the fusion energy project in 2012 .
we must pay out the money that we have promised .
we must not allow the creation of a temporary budget .
that would have a very negative effect on the running of the eu .
if we lose sight of this , we will lose credibility .
for example , the europe 2020 strategy is mentioned a number of time .
it is an ambitious , wasteful and perhaps overly broad strategy .
what in any case are supposed to be it priority ?
this is absolutely not what the citizen of europe are waiting for .
the rapporteur wa in no easy situation when she wa preparing her material .
if they are not doing this , they are doing wrong .
however , that final bill will still have to be paid .
i believe that the report tabled by mr balzani is a workable compromise .
however , i also have a few critical remark to make .
neither is there a single mention of cohesion policy .
i believe that there is still time to resolve these two issue .
the union 's priority need a suitable level of funding .
the objective have also been agreed by member state themselves .
the objective show u the direction we ought to choose .
the success of europe depends on how we fulfil them .
the eu budget largely cover investment in the future of europe .
i am afraid that this is a true story about 2012 's budget .
it ha it logic , a so clearly explained by mr gerbrandy .
the logic is all about the maturity of programme with time .
even in time of austerity , you have to pay your electricity bill .
today 's major project are those set out in the 2020 strategy .
this is precisely what the european semester is for .
( the sitting wa suspended at 10:55 and resumed at 11:35 )
an extraordinary meeting of the european council wa held on 11 march .
i regret that no such report ha been presented .
can we now please move on to the vote ?
yesterday , i wa denied the opportunity to respond directly to mr schulz .
the first amendment , 16th new citation , is a follows :
( fr ) the second amendment , recital a , is a follows :
appointment of the executive director of the european banking authority ( eba ) (
mr president , i will not keep you long .
we have withdrawn amendment 25 , which related to the financial transaction tax .
i believe that the council 's position wa a really good starting point .
i would ask for your support in this regard .
situation in japan , including the nuclear power plant alert (
( for outcome of the vote and other detail : see minute ) .
our head are in the sand , like the proverbial ostrich .
and yet we persist in putting sticking plaster on deep wound .
i will not say sovereign debt , it is citizen ' debt .
irish citizen are expected to deal with all of this .
we have been trying to buy time with bailouts .
the mechanism should now be brought a close a possible to eu institution .
we want to continue to trade with country in the euro zone .
i think it would be a disgrace if it were approved .
everyone must be treated equally in the labour market .
that is why i voted in favour of the report by mr mathieu .
it allows for there to be proper consideration of the issue .
we are often very keen to show solidarity for various group of people .
in this age of austerity we need to show restraint .
no doubt that will fall on the taxpayer a well .
i would like the committee to focus attention on one small issue .
that will bring certainty not only for consumer , but also for producer .
it will give some benefit to consumer and small business .
nevertheless , this is an important step towards better consumer protection and trade .
these lesson relate in particular to nuclear power station .
i call on the council urgently to table proposal in this regard .
the agricultural sector account for around 40 % of moldova 's economy .
russia is an important market outlet for moldova 's winemaker .
currently around 90 % of all import from moldova ... '
the request made by the republic of moldova in july 2010 is justified .
moldova need the european union to be a trustworthy partner .
furthermore , no damaging effect on the eu wine industry have been recorded .
this is our moral duty in the interest of european unity and harmony .
i therefore welcome the commission 's proposal to extend the period of validity .
this brings our trade relation with moldova into line with other neighbouring country .
this will benefit bordering country a well a the internal market .
in writing . - the text of the report is short .
the european parliament should be consulted on this issue from the earliest stage .
the european community wa the first to implement a gsp scheme in 1971 .
the gsp also release country from dependency on aid .
the european community started to apply this scheme in 1971 .
the first three-year scheme wa implemented from 2006 to 2008 .
the second scheme is due to expire on 31 december 2011 .
the current scheme wa adopted in 2008 under the consultation procedure .
for this very reason it must be put into practice without delay .
in writing . - ( de ) i have voted against this report .
however , it contains sufficient incentive to encourage reform .
it represents significant progress compared with the status quo .
the eu-us aviation market account for about 60 % of world air traffic .
while striving for economic benefit , we must not forget security requirement .
eu and u institution responsible for flight security must cooperate at all level .
i agree with the rapporteur 's analysis that this agreement is not perfect .
previously , parliament wa only consulted on such agreement .
previously parliament had only been consulted on such agreement .
that year 9 million people travelled between the united state and canada .
the ambitious nature of this agreement is very much to be welcomed .
it should serve a a target for other negotiation currently underway .
i therefore believe that parliament should consent to the eu-canada air transport agreement .
we can therefore surely say that the agreement adopted today is truly ambitious .
this is the most ambitious transport agreement ever signed between two country .
previously parliament had only been consulted on such agreement .
in that year nine million people were travelling between the eu and canada .
the eu and canada also negotiated an agreement on air safety .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report .
i have voted in favour of the conclusion of the agreement .
this is the reason why i voted for this report .
a great deal ha changed over those 20 year .
it is also important to achieve a free trade agreement .
this alone would be reason enough for u not to support the report .
i voted in favour of adopting the baudis report .
the persian gulf country are extremely important player in the peace process .
the report underline that concluding the fta remains a priority .
there should be a separate approach to every single country .
we firmly opposed execution and the trampling of woman 's right .
these are among the longest-running non-concluded trade negotiation that the eu ha undertaken .
the executive board of the european central bank requires a new member .
the european institution have to be served by the very best .
i wish him every success for the eight year of his term .
i have voted in favour of the appointment of mr farkas .
the european banking authority is the result of that .
i have voted in favour of the appointment of mr montalvo .
for my part , i voted in favour of mr ross ' nomination .
therefore , it is important that this agency begin operation soon .
i am voting in favour a there is now greater commitment .
this 2020 strategy is not a cure for the problem of the economy .
limiting appropriation would lead to payment and appropriation becoming more closely aligned .
this also applies to budget line for which implementation is lagging behind .
in my view , an increase in payment level is predictable in 2012 .
i voted in favour of the general guideline for preparing the 2012 budget .
this will allow europe to experience intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
this 2020 strategy is not a cure for the problem of the economy .
this 2020 strategy is not a cure for the problem of the economy .
this 2020 strategy is not a cure for the problem of the economy .
this report neglect to mention the importance of cohesion policy even once .
how can the european parliament justify the proposed increase ?
the adoption of these general guideline is an example of this .
it then often only need something trivial to tighten the noose .
on the basis of this conviction , i voted against the report .
i therefore voted against this report on the 2012 budget .
this will undoubtedly simplify the often complex administrative procedure for receiving economic migrant .
for all the above reason , i voted in favour of this report .
this document will have the residence permit format common to all member state .
all these difference do is to increase exploitation and uncertainty .
basically , we may be facing an attempt to promote social dumping .
the country must carry out more check in these area .
any rejection decision must be duly substantiated , transparent and objective .
the proposal doe not specify the condition for admitting third-country national .
the idea of combining a residence permit and a work permit is good .
every citizen and consumer should be guaranteed the same right within the union .
currently there remain obstacle to the smooth functioning of the market .
i congratulate mr schwab for the work done so far .
it would be useful if parliament were presented in this way more often .
consumer right are one of the main pillar of the internal market .
this could lead to the loss of consumer right in some member state .
a european single market expressly requires the removal of such barrier .
amendment 141 is unreasonable for small and medium-sized enterprise .
it doe not make thing particularly easy for small and medium-sized enterprise .
i voted in favour of the report on consumer right .
purchase at trade fair are now also classed a direct selling .
however , some important point still need to be improved .
it is this that make the directive adopted today important .
historically , europe base it foundation on the single european market .
it is also important for citizen to know their right .
this is a problem throughout europe , but particularly in my own country .
this explains why i voted in favour of this text .
this agency wa established in 2002 for an initial period of five year .
a top-down eu approach is required to protect the information society sector .
member state can not do this sufficiently by themselves .
the internet and it various tool are not in themselves oppressive .
it job is to ensure network and information security within the eu .
the added value they provide is highly questionable , however .
i am very much against the establishment of new agency .
the commission ha more than enough trained official to take on this task .
the strengthening of network and information is a matter of great importance .
in writing . - following the ordinary legislative procedure : ( first reading )
having regard to the commission proposal to parliament and the council ,
having regard to rule 55 of it rule of procedure ,
1. adopts it position at first reading , taking over the commission proposal ;
it task included both risk analysis and preventative measure .
that is why i voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
unfortunately , the outcome of this tragedy is still unknown .
one nuclear accident after another is coming on top of a natural disaster .
we urge the commission to drive and coordinate the european solidarity effort .
a regard the fukushima power station , european unease is legitimate .
we therefore supported the resolution and voted in favour .
a explained , i support the resolution on japan with conviction .
it is not a question of banning the debate on nuclear power .
the resolution on the situation in japan is therefore crucial .
solidarity is one of the fundamental pillar on which today 's europe rest .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
written declaration included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minute
forwarding of text adopted during the sitting : see minute
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the majority of those who died held high-ranking position within the state .
they were known personally to many present in this chamber .
laurent gbagbo must recognise the result of the election and hand over power .
all those guilty of crime will be brought to justice .
it wa a clear and deliberate attempt to once again destabilise my region .
this certainly call for a separate and far-reaching debate .
finding a solution to this problem is definitely not a simple matter .
signature of act adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure : see minute
action taken on parliament 's position and resolution : see minute
oral question and written declaration ( submission ) : see minute
this figure is in excess of what wa originally quoted .
this is not the way a member of this house should be treated .
in no other parliament would such a clear conflict of interest be tolerated .
it make an absolute mockery of the committee process .
i therefore call for a vote in support of the request .
( fr ) mr president , i would like to say two thing .
i would like someone from the ppe group to present this request .
not only should i use this opportunity to protest against the chinese authority .
i ask for the support of the vice-presidents in this .
mr gebhardt , could you once again explain your proposal .
you have not given u a chance to vote on that yet .
indeed , major discrepancy still remain between the different asylum system in europe .
admittedly , these procedural change may create cost in the short term .
it is crucial that the common procedure are fair and efficient .
i find the amendment on safe country notion very ambitious .
i also note with interest the compromise amendment on free legal assistance .
this enabled good compromise to be reached in some area .
i will give you a few example of this .
only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out .
the consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely .
talking about burden sharing should now lead to a practical and sensitive proposal .
this is why the vote on wednesday is so vitally important .
it is clear that standard vary too much between member state .
a we know , those asylum number have been plummeting for many year .
let u repeat the vote that we had in committee .
member state can decide on such matter perfectly well themselves .
this form of cynicism can not go unchallenged here .
( nl ) thank you , mr president , i will correct that .
it may be that you heard that from the interpreter .
i am talking about the historical name of this region , namely barbary .
all member state must have fair and legally certain procedure for asylum seeker .
the european union urgently need coordinated , fair and efficient asylum procedure .
common rule are in the interest of both member state and asylum seeker .
what is happening today on the italian island of lampedusa is alarming .
for that reason , too , we need to improve and coordinate procedure .
asylum seeker must not become victim of our system .
such wording leave the door wide open to abuse .
the same applies to the concept of safe country of origin .
mr president , international protection is a coded and euphemistic term for asylum .
this is not something that the commission just came up with .
i think that such export should not be permitted .
many member state make special export facilitation available to their exporter .
in this way , participation in international exhibition and fair will become easier .
this parliament ha previously taken a more responsible position in it committee .
in these committee , we have taken a very clear position .
to perform check only after the event would result in le security .
these service must also continue to be possible despite more stringent export provision .
there are various way to make this control difficult .
another difficulty is the plethora of rule that make any control system ineffective .
however , i would like to mention two aspect .
the amendment seek to make life easier for arm exporter .
therefore , my group will not support these amendment .
others - like my country , austria - abide by the restriction .
however , the system must also be kept up-to-date .
it includes everything from lorry to aeroplane jet engine and telecommunication equipment .
it must be stringent , predictable and clear , but also harmonised .
we must remember that trade is essentially a good thing .
i am therefore opposed to the proposal to introduce an ex ante declaration .
i think that this would be an effective way to combat cyber-terrorism .
consequently , it role should be strengthened , not overlooked .
thank you again for this debate , mr president .
i know that this matter concern a large branch of industry .
both producer and user of tourism statistic have requested this adjustment .
the majority of business in the tourism sector are small and medium-sized enterprise .
we can not have a high quality tourism sector without well-trained staff .
our colleague over here mentioned 4 % of gdp .
to solve these thing , we need good statistic , good data .
it is a very good report and everybody should support it .
i understand mr leichtfried a saying that tourism cause transport problem .
however , that is a wish that will probably not be fulfilled .
flexible working hour and safety influence tourism just a much a social change .
even the best european tourism statistic can do little to change these .
given it high potential , tourism therefore contributes to employment and economic growth .
such cooperation make the life of a rapporteur a lot easier .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 6 april 2011 .
eu policy framework to fight violence against woman ( debate )
imagine a mother sitting with her child and reading them a good-night story .
both she and the child know immediately what is going to happen .
she flees and is lucky to find sheltered accommodation .
after a few day , she leaf her child at the day nursery .
yet another victim of the deadly violence that affect woman .
she say goodbye to her friend and call out 'see you tomorrow ' .
other problem that we have to face include genital mutilation .
i welcome this and look forward to this action plan .
what i say is : we have had enough .
mr president , one in four european woman are victim of violence .
twenty six percent of child report having suffered physical violence during their childhood .
these figure show that europe ha a serious problem that requires action .
the eu need to act now and stop this violence .
putting a stop to violence will require a coordinated and multi-faceted effort .
we can only end this violence by taking action from a political standpoint .
on behalf of the alde group . - thank you mr president .
this strategy and policy initiative should also be complemented by broad awareness-raising activity .
for instance , we need a minimum level of assistance service .
domestic violence is a very serious form of violence against woman .
the problem of domestic violence is related to this .
domestic violence ha disastrous consequence for all family member , particularly child .
we must therefore raise awareness of the occurrence of this form of violence .
violence against woman ha negative consequence on the entire family .
i agree with the spirit of the svensson report in this respect .
there are situation in which child are removed because the parent are poor .
i would like to conclude with two more comment .
safety is an important commodity , especially for the most vulnerable amongst u .
we need adequate resource to tackle this kind of violence .
today , rather than tomorrow , and not just in 2012 or 2013 .
somebody 's safety can not and should not stop at the border .
social security in this respect is insufficient in many european country .
it is high time to put an end to this .
female genital mutilation and also honour killing are taking their toll in europe .
nevertheless , what can be done is to create a common european strategy .
we know that violence against woman and child is increasing across europe .
combating this phenomenon therefore requires political and social mobilisation .
after all , this is a question of ensuring equality and development .
consequently , we can not reduce funding in this area .
the figure of 25 % of woman having suffered violence is totally unacceptable .
there is a need to look at that risk and probability .
a far a latvia is concerned , marital rape simply doe not exist .
in slovakia , to be raped with an object is not considered rape .
woman are at most risk within their own four wall .
the commonest cause of injury in woman is domestic violence .
nowadays , many people are facing psychological problem which sometimes trigger violence .
this aspect is also supported a part of the stockholm programme .
particular attention should also be paid to violence in the workplace .
it is important to provide more specific wording on this issue , too .
this is surely one of the most horrendous violation of human right .
my thanks once again to all member for your strong resolve .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 5 april 2011 .
the deadening pseudo-morality found in society should give u pause for thought .
that is the only way to break the spiral of violence .
the treaty of lisbon also provides the legal competence for this .
the help provided to victim must be genuine and guaranteed .
i call on the commission to take action in this direction .
violence against woman is unquestionably a serious problem in all section of society .
these are alarming figure , behind which lie individual life story .
human right and gender equality are among the eu 's priority .
the approach taken to violence against woman differs according to national legislation .
violence affect woman at various time of life , from childhood to adulthood .
both of these island are therefore under strong migratory pressure .
several measure need to be taken in the short term .
these measure represent the immediate answer to the situation .
however , we also need to implement long-term , sustainable programme .
special attention must be given to the situation of vulnerable group .
i know that you are all willing to discus different element of this .
it is also very event-driven and it change almost by the hour .
a global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy .
but we also need a good policy on democracy and promoting human right .
stability without democracy is not a sustainable way forward .
stability is important , but it is not the only thing that matter .
we need fair access to legal migration that give migrant proper social right .
is that not what the eu wa founded for ?
we are not primarily concerned about the 20 000 who arrived in lampedusa .
we are concerned with the political fact that this represents .
i believe that what you said is along those line .
madam president , we hear many people express concern about migration today .
these event are sure to be followed by migration flow .
it ha already started and it is sure to continue .
the unhcr estimate that over 400 000 people have already left libya .
there is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified .
we also welcome the willingness to consider using the temporary protection directive .
you have spoken , commissioner , about reaching a codecision on resettlement .
europe ha left italy alone to face the unprecedented emergency .
the european union need to make it presence felt .
the only difference is that reality is surpassing fiction .
we have instrument that we are not using properly .
without this , trafficker will always manage to find alternative route .
perhaps , though , the new tunisian government ha learned it lesson .
we must meet the expectation of the people of the south .
the fear of immigration must no longer guide our policy .
this report refuse to see that migration is primarily a south-south issue .
the migrant also include illegal immigrant , criminal released from prison .
this rightly concern the country that must accept them .
the european union must stand up and take note , commissioner .
a lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible result
commissioner malmström , we have not mentioned countervailing measure .
a human tragedy is actually taking place a we speak in this house .
the european union ha to decide whether it want to act or react .
i believe that the temporary protection directive should be invoked now .
solidarity and responsibility ha to be a two-way street .
i remember 14 february 2009 , during the previous parliamentary session .
i went to lampedusa with a delegation from my parliamentary group .
it wa a journey into hell ; into hell , i say !
it is this hypocrisy that need to be changed .
this is what need to fundamentally change in the european union .
madam president , the council decision adopts the un security council resolution .
these immigrant had been transferred there because lampedusa is overfull .
the european union is not responsible for these fortune seeker .
let those country take responsibility , not u and not now .
fine , but why do they all have to come to europe ?
we now call on the european council to honour it word .
we have a tool already ; we just need to use it .
there is no doubt that there is a mass exodus leaving libya .
( de ) madam president , i would like to address three point .
frontex and dublin ii - we need a rethink where these are concerned .
a european asylum and immigration pact wa adopted over a year ago .
yes , we must increase frontex 's resource at all cost .
that will be the financial expression of our solidarity .
take your proposal and put them before the council .
tomorrow , we will do our bit in parliament .
we are bound to ask ourselves certain question about this .
many of my fellow member have spoken of libya and other country .
we can not go and oust president who are driven by crime .
by this i am primarily thinking of preventing conflict .
firstly , human dignity must be respected in all human being .
secondly , the european approach is to offer hospitality to all refugee .
i am well aware of this and i know you will act .
we hope that your proposal will be followed up .
( el ) madam president , we are at a turning point .
only in this way can we stop and prevent future migration .
tour operator have not received any booking for month but only cancellation .
europe must show it support with appropriate compensatory measure .
unfortunately , not all european government are adopting the same approach .
we can not eliminate it , but we must manage it .
we have failed to address the problem since 1990 .
it is not important who vote in the party and how .
what is of paramount importance is who count the vote .
it is the same story in romania where absolutely every election is rigged .
firstly , the eu should focus on the cause of migration flow .
secondly , i believe that migrant ' right need to be protected .
the problem of malta and of lampedusa are european union problem .
i talked extensively about the idea of solidarity during the lisbon treaty debate .
north africa is , of course , facing a challenge .
we should do everything to support them in this fantastic journey .
this is a challenge for which we should provide our support .
believe me , mr keller , we are trying to do that .
we have , in fact , offered assistance to italy .
we have the answer : we have europol in place .
most of the refugee are in tunisia and egypt .
a i said , more than 400 000 people have left libya .
there are also people from bangladesh , iraq , afghanistan , etc .
i visited these refugee camp only a few day ago .
many of these people might be in need of international protection .
we have certain policy to try to assist these people .
there are solidarity fund available for european country who respond to this appeal .
i will be happy to report back to you after that .
thank you very much , madam president , for a very important debate .
the commissioner said activation of directive 2001/55/ec will be discussed within council .
i end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 5 april 2011 .
the report on migration ha a solution for preventing migration flow .
the eu should focus migration policy exclusively on violation of human right .
like all revolution , this one also entail a risk .
moreover , the european effort must be stepped up .
we also need to cooperate more with the tunisian authority .
in writing . - the situation in libya at present is very uncertain .
the motion for a resolution highlight a very significant and important matter .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
we can not wait any longer - that is extremely important .
i call on the romanian authority to swap political complicity for legal measure .
do you think it is possible to close french school in belgium ?
or , let u say , german school in france ?
i shall tell you - a civil war will break out in latvia .
they are at the end of their useful life and are technically obsolete .
would the commission describe that a 'tough but sustainable ' ?
it is high time that the european union looked into this matter .
thankfully , most of these have failed to detonate .
however , a we have seen , this doe not apply to everyone .
the truth is that the forecast and estimate made are not being verified .
there is only one answer to this : growth .
the energy summit in february also brought a real breakthrough .
she urged all catholic not to be deterred by this murder .
we were so proud of ronan and all that he stood for .
do n't let his death be in vain ' .
those who murdered him have still not admitted to it .
it jeopardises the objective of the europe 2020 agenda .
no occupation of a sovereign state by another is acceptable under law .
the meat product some truck were carrying were completely destroyed by french picket .
these act of aggression have been repeated twice since the beginning of 2011 .
however , this ha not always been the case .
let u start with the csango hungarian culture in moldova .
role of woman in agriculture and rural area ( short presentation )
this will require fresh effort and new strategy by all concerned .
however , woman also have an essential role to play in agriculture .
ensuring adequate social cover for all woman who work in agriculture is essential .
no amendment have been tabled for tomorrow 's vote in plenary .
i would ask you to bring that message to the commission .
it is crucial that all service are not just market-oriented .
the great majority of these woman work on family farm .
fine word and declaration of good intention are therefore not enough .
this must remain , without fail , a component of the eafrd .
my last comment concern the ageing of the rural population .
it can see that this is a task for the rural development policy .
in addition , local transport service and small-scale infrastructure are eligible for support .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 5 april 2011 .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 5 april 2011 .
this is a carefully designed programme which started in 1999 .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 6 april 2011 .
conclusion of the european council meeting ( 24-25 march 2011 ) ( debate )
allow me to take each of those issue in turn .
on economic issue , we took forward a comprehensive package of measure .
i will not repeat all the decision we took in detail .
all those concerned understand the need to conclude by june .
the european council in june will draw the necessary conclusion .
number six : we provided for a new quality of economic coordination .
they are denmark , poland , latvia , lithuania , bulgaria and romania .
they will also be evaluated annually at the highest level .
regional support wa immediately forthcoming from the arab league .
we all know that the decision to take military action wa not easy .
there are , quite naturally , question and hesitation .
that is perfectly normal in issue of war and peace .
the political objective we set on 11 march remain unchanged .
we are also following the event in the rest of the region closely .
allow me to say a few word on côte d'ivoire a well .
we are ready a a union to assist in any way we can .
we encourage and support neighbouring country to do similar stress test .
a worldwide review of nuclear plant would be best .
i think it will now have a more stable basis .
a we all know , that wa not a foregone conclusion .
our new economic architecture is now largely in place , therefore .
for example , we would have liked greater flexibility .
the truth is that we are still in a difficult climate .
paragraph 6 of the european council conclusion could be mentioned in this respect .
this is vital if the whole governance system is to be in place .
we want to free up the single market 's potential for growth .
indeed , we believe that everyone should contribute towards dealing with the crisis .
the president of the council ha given u a very detailed report .
there is obviously mounting public anxiety over the nuclear issue .
we must address these anxiety and guarantee maximum nuclear safety .
there will no doubt be a pre-fukushima and a post-fukushima .
i agree with your approach to côte d'ivoire , mr president .
we have solved every difficulty to everyone 's complete satisfaction .
there is no consensus between france and germany on the libyan question .
what we need is the courage to make public investment .
take a look at the level of investment in the emerging state .
look at the level of public investment in india .
look at the other continent and the public fund invested there .
this mean that it will continue to do so .
that is three time the budget of the european union !
so that is the situation : eur 400 billion that we have invested .
we can even add a number of other element .
creating a european bond market is the only way out of the crisis .
i have to say i am astonished at how thing are presented here .
i would like to say one thing to you and to mr barroso .
you harp on about 'stability , growth , employment , competitiveness ' .
but do you know how that come across to our citizen ?
what they see are 'inequalities , a feeling of injustice , insecurity ' .
so , if we do not respond , we will not succeed .
what were our relation like with mr gaddafi before the bombing began ?
i have heard nothing about what you said on this matter .
there is no zero risk when it come to nuclear power .
the problem is nothing to do with stress testing one incident .
mathematically speaking , it is not possible to guarantee this safety .
however , this doe not mean that we want the eurozone to fail .
it is an attempt to go further towards fiscal and tax harmonisation .
my second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and libya in particular .
we still have time to discus japan this afternoon and tomorrow .
well , the chicken have come home to roost .
that is so typical of this place : full of hypocrisy and humbug .
( nl ) mr barroso , you will get your way .
the euro can not be rescued in this way .
instead , these country should be removed from it .
greece must get the drachma back and portugal must re-introduce the escudo .
i believe we are only now facing into the real test .
it ha taken u two and a half year to reach this point .
the commission did not provide leadership in resolving the problem .
there is absolutely no reason to rest on one 's laurel .
however , in the portuguese case your party also voted against the programme .
thing like this should not be allowed to happen in europe .
that is also the opinion of the portuguese government .
this is a european problem , which requires a european solution .
we need to ensure that everyone shoulder their responsibility .
one last point : i find the european council extremely inward-looking .
there is nothing about external representation of the euro area in the imf .
you are telling u that those on benefit should not worry .
you also tell u that revenue is being taken care of .
i have never seen anyone choose the most expensive fiscal option .
will they come from their shareholder or from u , the taxpayer ?
anyway , they obviously have nothing to worry about .
and the later we restructure , the more painful the exercise .
we need european muscle to deal with this , too .
are you serious about saving the eurozone and the european project ?
the new irish government ha drawn a line under the irish banking debacle .
the short answer is short-term electoral calculation and doctrinaire economics .
the irish economic crisis is an integral part of the european crisis .
ireland 's electorate ha accepted severe austerity through gritted teeth and seething anger .
( sv ) madam president , let me start with something positive .
thinking that the financial crisis is over is pure fantasy .
there are two topic that are particular cause for concern .
the problem is the basic direction of european economic governance .
we persist in treating the symptom of the illness instead of it cause .
deficit are the effect and not the cause of the crisis .
rightly so , but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing ?
small-mindedness will not save the euro and the market know that .
they bought expensive house far beyond what they could afford .
the debt crisis is being tackled with new debt .
the situation could then be re-examined in a year or 10 .
the uk deficit is largely structural and must be addressed internally .
the council state consolidation should be frontloaded in member state with large deficit .
the first level being between the member state themselves .
let u look at what happened yesterday in the irish election .
let u look at the electoral debate today in portugal .
my question then is : where are the cut to be made ?
romano prodi once famously said that these draft are stupid .
give europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious word .
the so-called stringent regulation will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice .
public confidence in europe will decline even further a a result .
when i saw you , therefore , i felt let down .
we also need to ensure that we are reforming the european market .
you have defined it yourselves : the eu 2020 strategy .
we need public investment , first and foremost in education .
this is a topic that is now the subject of negotiation in parliament .
we must ensure that there is openness and transparency .
some of these position are currently taking refuge in form of nationalism .
they turn up unexpectedly , both inside and outside the eu .
do you think that this is not a problem for european citizen ?
we expect much more progress from the council and the commission .
the european union , which considers solidarity an asset , must help .
the disaster shook the world 's energy and raw material market .
it will determine the political and economic environment for a long time .
it is imperative that we improve the world 's nuclear safety .
creating the single currency ha undoubtedly been a success .
however , it look like a beautiful house with a damaged roof .
i welcome the council 's conclusion on the matter relating to libya .
what else can we do for our close southern neighbour ?
can we use our experience from the eastern partnership in the mediterranean region ?
this mean that we did not learn our lesson from japan .
we must stop calling today for new nuclear power plant to be built .
madam president , i would like to touch upon three issue .
at the same time , this relationship is important .
with investment will come job , which are essential for u in europe .
however , these priority must be very quickly converted into specific domestic measure .
firstly , they do not know how many people will come .
firstly , that there is no majority in the council of minister .
i appeal to president barroso not to cite this a reason .
the commission is also stating that the number are not yet large enough .
this is the result of past mistake and the lack of appropriate instrument .
what wa wrong with the policy of member state and the eu institution ?
it is good that an agreement ha been reached .
for that reason the recent eu-imf bail-out hurt the irish people badly .
individual do not get a guaranteed interest-free investment and neither should bondholder .
when will we finally see a tax on financial transaction ?
it is a shame that hungary ha missed out on this .
( de ) madam president , the eu is a master of procrastination .
our unequivocal priority should be to restore employment and sustainable economic growth .
i again appeal to everyone to observe the relevant criterion .
nature is a stronger force than man can harness .
it is time to put an end to nuclear power .
so , let u finally concentrate on the renewable energy .
therefore , let u be intellectually honest in our assessment .
practically everything you have said , the commission ha already proposed .
we presented the text at the euro area summit .
it wa rejected by a large majority of member state .
this wa rejected by some of our member state .
this may be an opportunity for u to work even more closely .
that is all on the issue of ambition at european level .
this wa rejected by a huge number of our g20 partner .
i think this is basic in term of fairness .
i will come forward with proposal on this matter .
we have been discussing process and instrument for a very long time .
the challenge we need to resolve is our economic renewal .
it is true that there have been rather pessimistic view expressed here today .
this is probably because it is not so bad after all .
my second observation concern methodology , if you will .
however , we still need to work within the framework of the treaty .
therefore let u not level any unfounded accusation against the european union .
a i have already said , the past need to be managed .
so there is the future and there is the past .
could we have taken those measure a year ago ?
we undermined the stability and growth pact seven or eight year ago .
the internal market , the single market is extremely important .
some of you have been very critical of the european union .
and the european union deserves credit for correcting them .
i should like to say one last thing in my own language .
i , too , feel let down by so much intellectual dishonesty .
i would ask you to please stop hiding behind the council .
the council is made up of sovereign minister of state and prime minister .
this wa not what the treaty of lisbon wa about .
lisbon wanted majority decision-making to be the norm within the eu .
of course , the work in this respect must not stop .
however , certain proposal in the pact are unworkable .
structural reform to promote employment and social inclusion must also be implemented .
they must be defined according to each country 's particular situation .
migration flow arising from instability : scope and role of eu foreign policy (
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : czech republic - unilever (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
europe need to show sympathy and a willingness to help .
this question disregard two piece of information , often for ulterior motif .
the island of lampedusa and italy were left without any answer .
on of the european union 's key tool is trade policy .
mr president , the premise of this report is incorrect .
we have trapped million in the squalor of dependency .
that make people look to go abroad and they come here .
this visibility should lead not only to social recognition but also to provision .
unfortunately , however , it view woman only a worker or entrepreneur .
today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across europe .
we are basically subsidising the nuclear lobby which fought for reconditioning .
now , however , we can change the political will .
convert subsidy for reconditioning unsafe reactor into funding to close them .
convert resource from euratom financing and abundant iter subsidy .
we are in a state of emergency and we must respond .
the danish liberal party is essentially against the globalisation adjustment fund .
mr president , violence against woman is not a private issue .
the svensson report ha unfortunately not yet overcome this conflict .
mr president , i voted against the svensson report .
it just want to replay the fight of the early 70 .
this is what the european union doe , is it not ?
this is where the power grab start and shame on it .
it main aim is to help such people to re-enter the labour market .
this is the first request to be examined under the 2011 budget .
the committee on employment and social affair assessed the respective eligibility condition favourably .
the annual budget available for the egf is eur 500 million .
the rationale behind the european globalisation adjustment fund is intolerable .
poland ha applied for support for 594 redundancy in the podkarpackie region .
the european union must therefore be ready to withstand the flow of migration .
for all the above reason , i voted for this report .
i voted in favour of this text on migratory flow .
they can not cope alone with these emergency humanitarian and immigration situation .
the main motivation of these migrant is purely economic .
it is the arrival of democracy that worry it .
migration flow resulting from instability are a challenge for the european union .
what is happening in north africa is proof of 'fortress europe ' .
the measure proposed in the report are not sufficient and are too declarative .
a precise and specific financial economic plan is necessary .
mr provera 's original report wa very good and well-balanced .
however various amendment have unfortunately changed it in the wrong way .
it is for this reason that i have cast a 'no ' vote .
migration flow resulting from instability are currently a major challenge for the eu .
i am strongly opposed to the report in question .
the problem can not be shouldered basically by greece , italy and spain .
since january , 23 000 immigrant have entered italy .
frontex can not be the only instrument involved in tackling the refugee crisis .
coordination between foreign policy and immigration policy is essential .
that is why i voted in favour of mr provera 's report .
i would like to take this opportunity to reiterate this demand .
i voted for this report which help combat social exclusion in rural area .
they must get more political support at local , national and european level .
it is essential to facilitate woman 's access to farming and agricultural credit .
traditional job in these area have declined in number .
the future of the agricultural sector depends on it ability to diversify .
it seems that the rapporteur showed her kindness to woman working in agriculture .
i voted 'for ' ; however , the report is raw and unprofessional .
what if woman farmer were the future of the common agricultural policy ?
here we have a simple and modern way of re-thinking the agricultural profession .
the role of woman in rural area is also changing .
the decommissioning of nuclear power plant is a very complicated process .
the resource allocated must certainly be managed in a proper and transparent manner .
the key word in this report is 'responsibility ' .
unfortunately , the allocated amount were not used correctly .
the disaster in japan ha made u all think about nuclear safety .
i welcome the fact that the eu is able to support such activity .
germany decided to take a similar step immediately after the disaster in japan .
the eu member state must take appropriate measure in this respect .
the eu is committed to providing sufficient financial support to meet these obligation .
that is why i voted in favour of this european parliament resolution .
however , i believe that eu nuclear policy should go further .
this house must clearly condemn this financing of new nuclear power plant .
the recent accident in japan ha highlighted the risk inherent to nuclear plant .
maybe it is better to carry out reconstruction work ?
the eu is committed to further payment until the end of 2013 .
national authority must finalise detailed decommissioning plan a a matter of urgency .
the assistance programme ha been subject to regular audit and assessment .
2.7 billion euro wa set aside for this over the 1999-2013 period .
a on other occasion , we voted in favour .
this application complies with the requirement for determining the financial contribution .
the czech republic ha applied for support for 634 redundancy .
the european globalisation adjustment fund is a controversial mechanism .
it is a much use a a plaster on a wooden leg .
in reality it is being used to finance redundancy plan .
i have made such call many time in the committee on budget .
this is natural and , in my opinion , should be maintained .
export control on dual-use product are the subject of measure at eu level .
this regulation expanded the scope of control on sale and transportation .
this is crucial in avoiding the proliferation of weapon .
control of export ha a large impact on eu trade policy .
the role of european ecas demonstrates the hollowness of this claim .
the approval of this resolution represents a further step in this direction .
parliament ha just decided to opt for ex-post control .
export credit are an important instrument for supporting eu enterprise .
ecas facilitate legitimate trade where the private capital market fails .
transparency regarding the use of these fund is therefore compulsory .
when it came to voting either for or against , we abstained .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
i view export credit a an important instrument for supporting eu enterprise .
ecas have become the major source of public finance for developing country .
the principle of subsidiarity must be scrupulously upheld in this area .
the agency facilitate legitimate trade where the private capital market fails .
violence against woman is an international a well a a european problem .
this is also very important for combating trafficking in human being .
it is important for young woman to be protected against such forced relationship .
honour-related violence is a key concept in this context .
the international community must implement a cross-border approach to combat violence against woman .
some country still do not have a law criminalising domestic violence against woman .
domestic violence must not be treated a a private matter .
we encourage the commission to fight violence against woman .
woman subjected to violence could call this number to obtain immediate assistance .
gender-based violence result in severe harm to individual ' physical and mental health .
gender-based violence is also a serious problem in term of democracy .
this support and counselling service is one of many across ireland east .
i hope this report help fight domestic violence in europe .
faced with such figure , there is an urgent need to take action .
violence against woman is both a global and european issue .
so let u respect woman 's right , too .
it is important now that the guidance included in this report be implemented .
the victim are frequently not capable of holding down a job .
the member state should consider drafting a plan to combat gender-based violence .
statistic currently available portray a sad and distressing reality .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
a european directive against gender violence is therefore becoming essential .
the member state must adopt measure to this end at the first opportunity .
unfortunately , these amendment were rejected by the latvian parliament .
the apathy and pseudo-morality found in society should give u pause for thought .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
i am therefore supporting the report by mr svensson .
i call on the commission to take action in this direction .
but how do we do this when budget are being slashed ?
violence against woman is reprehensible and need to be dealt with firmly .
however , this report completely fails to mention the role of islam .
the form and method of violence used against woman are many .
( the sitting wa suspended at 13:25 and resumed at 15:00 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is question hour with the president of the commission .
mr oettinger , it is nice to see you .
we are going to do this for all the nuclear site in europe .
we are going to do this in full transparency .
i believe this is progress in term of nuclear safety .
i believe that this is a real and present danger .
we are now defining the modality and the scope of those stress test .
this is the case in all member state , including hungary .
hungary did that before the accession to the union .
there are even country that have done this after accession .
it is important for the commission to look into this .
this is a matter that should not even have to be discussed .
president of the commission . - we are taking that exercise very seriously .
but we are doing that to make the life of our citizen better .
mr harm , you have raised a very important issue .
these will then enter into force a of next week .
i can not take decision solely on the basis of personal opinion .
we have a regulation that wa established after chernobyl .
it ha a different threshold to the one we have in europe .
the level permitted are lower , which mean that their standard are higher .
i believe this is the best , most proportionate , scientific-based approach .
i do not think any other approach would be advisable at this time .
this is undoubtedly a source of growth for the european union .
however , you know the institution you are running .
the european commission is sometimes a bit of a difficult animal to run .
the commission ha a good record on this matter .
for this reason i intend to focus on a particular aspect .
after all , nuclear power doe not respect national border .
the commission will also present a report which will be made public .
let me say that we are on target to achieve that goal .
so european union legislation that make this binding on member state already exists .
yet she wrote this many day after the bombing had begun .
that wa probably what lady ashton wa referring to .
in addition she ha had to introduce the new european external action service .
the word 'single ' implies that it will not coexist with other currency .
other country outside the eurozone appear to be in a less-favoured position .
the next topic is the european response to the tragedy in japan .
please raise a white card - or any other .
the blue card is for quite a different procedure .
we have to act within our sphere of responsibility .
i should like once again to express my respect for the japanese people .
i am happy that the european council ha now clarified it position .
if so , how do you propose doing this ?
for instance , commissioner oettinger ha already been in contact with russian partner .
i can assure you that japan very much appreciated that gesture .
this issue is one we all need to get behind .
my second point concern import of food product from japan .
lastly , i have an appeal to make to you mr barroso .
colleague , you are talking in the place of other member .
there is a long list of colleague who are waiting to speak .
a regard this last point , i wa not aware of this situation .
concerning the issue of milk , you are right mr rivasi .
tepco 's stock of anti-radiation suit ran out very quickly .
he and his colleague were forced to invent spare part .
i think that what you have said is extremely important .
and let me tell you about the japanese people too .
madam , i also agree with the president of the european commission .
what doe the commission have to say to all this ?
i believe that special attention should be paid to this .
that is the right approach to trying to solve this issue constructively .
for this reason , i clearly support the austrian shutdown campaign .
i wonder if you could throw some light on this .
for the japanese economy it also represents very little .
nevertheless , we have now had another tragedy , far away in japan .
a i mentioned , japan ha very high food safety standard .
eu framework for coordinating national rom integration strategy ( debate )
determined action is needed , both at national and at european level .
so the measure in place so far are not adequate .
i would like to make three key point here .
a a minimum , all rom child should complete primary school .
access to healthcare : reducing the gap in health between rom and non-roma .
thirdly , the union must put it money where it mouth is .
making our financial instrument more effective is a key objective for me .
the council will deal with it in a horizontal manner .
the reason for this is that 8 april is international rom day .
the european rom strategy can be a type of professional minimum .
i hope that the european council adopts the planned strategy in june .
i ask for the support of the european parliament in this matter .
i would like to make some criticism of the presented framework .
the commission ha correctly defined the competence for solving this europe-wide problem .
however , the key competence continue to be at the member state level .
it is now essential to ensure that they are fulfilled .
the situation , a we can see , is fairly complicated .
i believe the agency ha proven it competence in this area .
nevertheless , i must emphasise certain failing in this communication .
i find this another weakness in the commission document .
it is good that it is mentioned in this communication .
i feel this would have been a plus in this communication .
in nearly ten year little of substance ha been achieved on the ground .
the strategy on the rom must take account of all the significant area .
there are no structure for the specific implementation of target .
you complain that the eu structural fund for the rom are not used .
do we want to talk about these problem a well ?
if a firm stance is not taken , the situation will deteriorate .
however , these ambition still need to be put into practice .
international rom day will be celebrated next friday , 8 april .
we had said that the update would be around the rate of inflation .
in this way , we will also make additional saving during implementation .
reducing the increase to 2.3 % is therefore progress .
it is in fact a cut of about 0.5 % in real term .
personally , i would have liked to have seen an even smaller increase .
however , we should recognise that saving have been made .
finally , could i also raise two important outstanding issue ?
it is far too soon for u to commit ourselves to that .
secondly , there is the issue of the house of european history .
our task is to look and see where we can genuinely save money .
the european parliament 's budget consists of more than just these amendment .
it need to be dealt with in other report .
we can not let ourselves be diverted from other important topic .
i believe that we can expect a fruitful cooperation with all group .
so , we are not really making saving , but rather reducing growth .
we really should be honest enough to call a spade a spade .
of course the green also want to increase spending on youth employment .
however , this is part of the commission budget .
is this the signal this house want to give to our citizen ?
that would be the right thing to do from a political perspective .
the only difference between the two is how the loss get distributed .
there are many way to save money for the european taxpayer .
there is huge scope for saving on energy cost .
our office have no temperature control or individually adjustable heating and air conditioning .
we waste a tremendous amount of energy every year .
there is large scope for saving on security and it service .
in both case , we need far better service for much le money .
we should review and revise our health insurance cost a well .
budgeting is about setting priority , both positive and negative .
the same criterion applies to our salary and expense .
the answer is not much , but still enough .
mr lamassoure yesterday said that he wa willing to step down from office .
we must now start to take this matter seriously .
madam president , i have a question for my honourable colleague .
however , that is not taking responsibility ; that is populism .
i do not think i need to go on .
madam president , mr porta doe not need to continue .
at that time , the will to review certain thing wa lacking .
that is probably the most sensible way to approach this .
it may well be that i will then be among them .
it is better to reflect carefully on where we can make cut .
let u do so , then , a a matter of priority .
i now turn to u , the member of this house .
is it not time to review this financial statute ?
the idea of the house of european history is supported in many quarter .
i would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence .
ultimately , i think we should be following the line of president barroso .
i am therefore not in favour of this budget increase .
doe this or doe this not all have to be paid for ?
we have to comply with all the agreement concluded regarding property .
youth is never a controversial area : youth is a necessity .
for example , my country ha 50 % youth unemployment .
i am sure that is the priority for all of you .
parliament need to be very selfcritical in this budgetary procedure .
i think that we could look for more saving here .
i believe that there is a chance that we could obtain significant reduction .
it is important to create and apply a strategy for electronic administration .
the commission 's current proposal for updating salary is 0.9 % .
parliament alone can not amend the statute for member .
the approval of the commission and the council are required .
protection of community ' financial interest - fight against fraud ( debate )
another major problem relates to the collection of data and information .
seventy per cent of import come through the simplified procedure .
i will concentrate my remark on six very important element of it .
we expect that to change in the report for the following year .
the third issue concern the transparency of beneficiary ' funding .
it provides u with an insight into what may be going wrong .
it provides u with an insight into what can be improved .
in that context , this report is very important indeed .
first of all , the report need to be more precise .
secondly , the member state need to improve their reporting .
this is sub-optimal at the moment , and i use the term advisedly .
only two of the four whose name were revealed have effectively resigned .
will this parliament review the legislation these four meps have worked on ?
moreover , jobbik recommends that sentence be doubled for politician .
commissioner , i wa not at all pleased to read this .
hence our call for the full implementation of the ims .
we are very unhappy with the situation in italy .
this country is way ahead of the rest when it come to fraud .
these are the basic tool we should use to fight corruption .
( nl ) madam president , i am pleased with this report .
there is a disproportionate rise in irregularity in poland , romania and bulgaria .
spain and italy are responsible for the highest number of case of irregularity .
over recent year , only 10 % of legitimate recovery were actually recovered .
these were just a few fact from the report .
( nl ) madam president , i thank mr staes for his question .
let me be clear - i am a great advocate of this .
italy ha often been discussed in relation to this subject .
italy is also mentioned in mr ivan 's document .
that is something that we need to be aware of .
european union taxpayer ' money must be used appropriately and efficiently .
the current recovery rate is very low and intolerable .
the context is made more complicated by the unresolved inefficiency in recovering loss .
in any case , one figure seems clear and confirms a long-running trend .
( de ) madam president , error are made through carelessness or ignorance .
we must give new strength to the weak mechanism for combating fraud .
the issue wa raised of transparency of beneficiary a well .
this report is the result of the collaboration and excellent cooperation i had .
the next item is question time ( b7-0210/2011 ) .
subject : provision of humanitarian aid to country in north africa
we are closely monitoring development and preparing for different scenario .
many nurse were evacuated , though not so many doctor .
doe the commission intend to take any action in this regard ?
our priority is to facilitate cooperation among member state to reduce the inequality .
until then we have to wait , i 'm afraid .
europe must develop more competitive technology up to patented prototype stage .
that is the state of the art , mr harkin .
one of these option wa to continue the current policy beyond 2013 .
finally , the picture for social sustainability is the same .
so the status quo is really not an option for the commission .
we need the reform and we are working for it .
we do not have the scientific knowledge for 50 % of our fishery .
the reality is that the situation is very fragile .
i can only agree that our situation is very fragile .
we care about our fisherman and about the generation to come .
another member referred to the selectivity of fishing gear .
in general there is a ban on shark finning .
i have therefore asked my service to thoroughly study all the contribution received .
we have banned gill net below 200 metre to protect deepwater shark .
we had a very rough time negotiating this in the council .
madam president , cutting the fin off shark is barbaric .
we need to put in place a regulation banning this practice completely .
in particular , can trade sanction be taken against those two area ?
i agree with you and we know the reality and how it work .
we know that there is a very profitable industry behind all this discussion .
we are going to regulate this situation once and for all .
how do mediterranean energy transport policy fit into the maritime strategy ?
the commission is highly satisfied with the general approval for it initiative .
i am counting on this initiative and i hope it will be fruitful .
we are trying to have a maritime cooperative strategy for this region .
last year member state and the commission engaged in bilateral dialogue .
progress is related to the high quality of higher education institution .
stakeholder are actively involved in all stage of this feasibility project .
( el ) thank you very much , commissioner , for your reply .
we have very strong monitoring in place , which will be done diligently .
i think that is a step forward that wa needed .
to what is the large number of error due ?
what immediate action will it take to deal with the problem ?
the main risk is that beneficiary include ineligible cost in their cost statement .
that obviously brings complexity and a risk of error .
subject : involvement of smes in european research and innovation
doe the commission plan to allocate a european funding quota solely for smes ?
one is allowing more flexibility a to how personnel cost are calculated .
we designed an e-learning platform specifically targeted at smes .
thank you , commissioner , for the detailed answer .
on marine-protected area , have we had any progress ?
there is special mention of this in the nagoya target .
there is one thing i would like to add .
concerning marine protected area , we are lagging behind still .
on the question of target , the answer is pretty simple .
in greece there are plan to construct 61 landfill site with cofinancing arrangement .
deviation from the hierarchy for specific waste stream are possible .
we are waiting for an updated waste management plan from greece .
i am aware of that and of the seriousness of the issue .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:20 and resumed at 21:00 )
political party at european level and rule regarding their funding ( debate )
the proposal cover not only european political party , but also their foundation .
naturally , i hope that plenary will vote in favour of this report .
i would also like to thank mr giannakou for preparing this own-initiative report .
we in the commission consider that report to be a very important one .
we know that european political party play an important role in european integration .
the matter therefore requires a very careful and detailed analysis indeed .
firstly , party are not much esteemed in any country .
this will increase the individual european citizen 's sense of belonging to europe .
i come now to the core of my argument .
i thank mr giannakou and the commissioner for their pledge .
it is political party that enable this plural representation .
regulating european party mean nowadays creating a civic space without border .
in this respect , the giannakou report is an invitation to reform-minded politician .
a number of sensitive issue are raised in this report .
we did not agree on all the point to begin with .
however , we are happy to sign up to the final result .
this wa originally required in order to receive recognition and funding .
this condition now only applies to the funding issue .
democracy depends also on a connection between government and governed - an affinity .
you can not create the institution of functioning representative government by bureaucratic fiat .
you will not create european by spending public money .
i would expect constructive cooperation from the commission and council .
that is what we do , and well you know it .
will you accept the principle of european law though ?
i do not know , i am not venturing that far .
the issue of a funding system is also appropriate .
we wanted to draw your attention to this point .
let u first support national party , and then international one .
after all , the european union is a europe of nation state .
obviously , i am already completely against that idea .
my party is a party that stand for the interest of the netherlands .
could you make thing le difficult in this connection ?
this is not because i have anything against european party .
european party should grow politically , organisationally and financially from the bottom up .
doe it want to buy it way to power ?
parliament are the motor of democracy and political party are the fuel .
small organisation should also be able to take part in the debate .
there is no demand from our citizen for transnational politician .
we need to find a way of returning money to our national exchequer .
it doe not interest the citizen , and quite rightly so .
this is a completely senseless pouring of taxpayer ' money down the drain .
the ceiling being proposed for each candidate is approximately eur 11 600 .
adopting these cost regulation would eliminate electoral bribery and illegal funding .
several speaker raised the question of amending the financial regulation .
the vote will take place on 6 april at 12:00 .
the european union ha faced repeated criticism due to the lack of democracy .
in most case , these referendum are dominated by purely domestic issue .
they simply do not have a mandate for that .
my loyalty belongs to my voter , not to a european political party .
a a staunch european , i must therefore vote against this report .
( 15572/2010 - c7-0020/2011 - 2010/0287 ( nle ) ) and
the european fishing industry can only provide for 40 % of our self-sufficiency .
it constitutes an important european union financial instrument in the area of fishery .
this is an essential condition for it sustainable development .
the proposal is to increase the ceiling from 50 % to 60 % .
this wa when only those two institution were involved in the procedure .
today , a the new deadline approach the situation is radically different .
added to this , the fishing sector is in crisis .
it is vital that the commission begin work immediately on this new proposal .
the problem is with the legal basis and not the content .
it make limited adaptation and clarification of the provision .
i therefore urge the european parliament to approve the proposal
i hope we will be successful in that aim .
the draft wa to be put forward in the third quarter of 2011 .
technical measure used in the individual sea basin differ according to local condition .
this is something that i have raised time and time again already .
my amendment refer to the use of tangle net .
in relation to boarfish , this is a new form of fishery .
it ha been developed primarily by fisherman from my own country .
in conclusion , i urge all member to think about
the eu ha had an agreement with this poor country since 1998 .
the country 's own fishery sector is still completely undeveloped .
we taxpayer provide 65 % of this amount and vessel owner 35 % .
the same thing ha been done to others in that area .
i especially welcome the opportunity for funding scientific research into fishery and aquaculture .
i would also like to thank mr grelier for her report .
we have been unable to acquiesce to his wish .
another 18 month of dumping dead fish back into the sea .
i am going to focus on two report , given their importance .
one of them is about the agreement with the union of the comoros .
this agreement establishes the possibility of catching their excess fish .
third country catch 75 % of the area 's fishery resource .
it is important from the point of view of the european union .
this will expand the single market in fishery product and their by-product .
these measure are all interconnected and have not been evaluated .
the joint debate on four report relating to fishery affair is closed .
i am disappointed that the amendment were not accepted .
the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector should be balanced .
the member state must also take an extremely active part in this process .
first , ensuring implementation of single market norm that have already been adopted .
finally , public procurement procedure need to be rationalised .
what message are people getting from brussels and strasbourg ?
they are essential message therefore , but restrictive and difficult .
that is how the single market act came into being .
every region , every business , every citizen is needed .
what is the next step now after your debate ?
we will have 12 lever : 12 specific but not exclusive proposal .
sixty per cent of public/private partnership in europe operate through concession .
we are in favour of openness , but we do not advocate gullibility .
we are working on a number of such law currently a well .
a comprehensive economic crisis management package ha also been prepared .
allow me to remind you of the broader context a well .
those committee will now take the floor in turn .
in a globalised market , the eu must meet the challenge it face .
is that not a much smarter approach , commissioner ?
this is much more important than applying general formula .
this term is also used to mean central state control of the economy .
the internal market represents a huge opportunity for all of u .
in addition , business need more funding to develop innovation .
we do not want dangerous product to be sold on the internal market .
growth , development and social awareness must go hand in hand .
there must be economic growth at the service of citizen .
i would like to draw attention to four important aspect .
i hope that the commissioner will assist u in making these a reality .
he say that we need to work with regulation more .
however , the citizen themselves do not seem to be aware of that .
( the debate wa interrupted for a few moment )
the coast guard ha been doing it best to rescue the missing people .
the concept of the internal market must be based on this principle .
the euro is making the internal market into a home market .
the internal market is essential for growth and employment .
of course , other question are also important in this context .
this is exactly what we social democrat are always saying .
the economy is there for the people and not vice versa .
we have achieved that in what we have done so far .
there are also area which we really have to develop .
he is actually the only conservative mep who is a committee chair .
i do not apologise at all for the work i do here .
mr president , commissioner , i greatly enjoyed your speech today .
in a free market society , not everything can be for sale .
these blue card allow a member to ask another member a question .
our honourable colleague , mr harbour , ha replied .
everyone is now free to interpret this answer a more or le complete .
you may consider it wanting , others may consider it complete .
( nl ) mr president , let me begin with the positive .
the internal market wa never intended to create all-embracing equality in europe .
take , for example , voice and data roaming charge .
far too many have also been implemented unsatisfactorily or incorrectly .
one danger lie in the inequality of eu citizen .
right and obligation must be the same for all eu citizen and company .
one of the cornerstone of the single market is the euro .
those are the two aspect that i believe are fundamental to our compromise .
the second item that i would like to highlight concern the tax-related aspect .
his is surely one of the most important name in today 's session .
no one ha mentioned the idea of a new value-added tax strategy .
we must have the right to decide on these vat rule for ourselves .
there are positive and negative aspect to all three report .
the last few metre are the most difficult and the most strenuous .
so do not let u down and give them the confidence they need !
there is still much to do to deliver this .
even the existence of the trade union movement itself is now in question .
commissioner barnier , do not let this throw you .
just one word to my fellow member , mr sinclaire .
mr correia de campos is concerned about movement of worker .
the eu ha swamped the united kingdom with extra worker .
the united kingdom see the world a the market .
i think the single market is the european union 's great challenge .
in this final sprint , thing are more exciting but also more difficult .
it is not a pipe dream ; it is realistic and also modern .
i believe it is time to refocus our attention on the single market .
it expansion and success is crucial for our economy .
all of this form part of modern public procurement law .
europe is fingered a being responsible for the crisis .
in the past , europe ha been ingenuous in matter of external trade .
lastly , europe is often seen to be a source of constraint .
it should henceforth be seen a a source of enablement .
parliament , i am sure , will support you in this matter .
the current situation lead to negative competition between the system .
that is not a good thing for business or for their employee .
please come to grip with this subject a well .
the european union must send a clear and unequivocal message about public service .
the treaty of lisbon provides u with the legal foundation to do so .
it is now up to you to turn them into a legislative proposal .
for this reason , the social clause is important .
however , i will try to divide that time fairly and evenly .
the three report took account of these shortcoming and also defined them excellently .
moreover , the single market should benefit all enterprise equally .
here , i have in mind small and medium-sized enterprise in particular .
governance and partnership are two aspect essential to reviving the market .
this is also achieved by making the whole european system more democratic .
finally , on public procurement , i welcome the commission 's proposal .
at the present stage , the citizen ' side is extremely weak .
just now , mr zwiefka spoke of utopia , recalling the founding father .
moreover , mr thun referred to this european determination just now .
that is what mr jaakonsaari and mr gebhardt have recommended .
we must improve the governance of the internal market .
this de-compartmentalisation applies to the assessment of the different directive .
i wish to work , mr schwab , towards the de-compartmentalisation needed .
it is going much faster than u in certain area .
we , european , must be the driving force behind our own future .
the single market is the keystone , the platform of our economy .
for me , this is extremely important from two aspect .
the commission ha already completed a good part of the job .
naturally , however , they , too , still have much to do .
this is the hungarian presidency 's motto a well .
the first is the situation of small and medium-sized enterprise ( smes ) .
we intend to adopt conclusion on the subject a well .
we all know that there is enormous unexploited potential in this area .
several member mentioned infrastructure bond a well in the debate .
lastly , i would like to address social aspect .
we must raise the political profile of the single market .
we need to take action immediately and not after some year .
the question wa not answered and should be answered .
instead , my colleague answered the question about job in the west midland .
this proposal simplifies legislation by gathering together several directive .
at the same time , i can imagine what they will include .
the single market is crucial for the future growth of the eu economy .
the financing of development and innovation represents a problem for them .
a european policy maker , we can not emphasise this enough .
let u now be consistent in getting down to this work .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
you were quite right to remind this packed house of it .
immigrant from north africa died trying to reach italy and europe .
there are 130 missing and 20 body have already been found .
there must be no more reticence ; the council and government must act .
we know that there are dead body and 150 people are missing .
and now , sadly , that go without saying .
( the house rose and observed a minute 's silence )
draft amending budget no 1/2011 - section iii - commission (
estimate of revenue and expenditure for 2012 - section i - parliament (
protection of community ' financial interest - fight against fraud (
political party at european level and rule regarding their funding (
the next item on the agenda is the vote .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
this fund wa designed for natural disaster such a earthquake and flood .
this chamber is in plain violation of it own regulation .
you can not carry on forever getting deeper and deeper in debt .
the position is also supported by the european parliament 's legal service .
mr president , my group voted in favour of this report .
the drop is mainly due to push factor in the area of origin .
this mean that the picture is much more encouraging than is usually thought .
this is why the alde group and i have voted in favour .
moreover , tourism represents a strong growth engine for europe .
however , tourism demand ha changed in recent year .
( ga ) i am pleased to vote for this report .
that is why i voted in favour of this initiative .
i voted for amendment 5cp in relation to mesh size .
that is why i voted in favour of the initiative .
it is therefore important that airline ticket should be exchangeable .
we have to cut cost , however ; that is absolutely clear .
i think it is extremely important to distinguish between fraud and error .
i think that it should be at least 10 % .
for this reason , i voted in favour of this report .
it is very important for smes to have access to public procurement procedure .
natural disaster are no longer a rarity in europe .
therefore , it can be regarded a an appropriate refinancing instrument .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of this proposal .
the eu must continue to be an organisation that show solidarity .
following the disaster , the country in question requested assistance from the eusf .
for the above reason , i supported this report .
many of them continue to struggle with the flood 's tragic effect .
many people are still waiting for the financial assistance promised by the authority .
many people have suffered , often losing everything they owned .
this , therefore , significantly exceeds the threshold for mobilising the solidarity fund .
i am strongly in favour of mobilising the solidarity fund .
in this case , the disaster occurred in may and june 2010 .
it should be noted that the disaster occurred in may and june 2010 .
the flood of 2010 affected extensive area across several central european country .
there wa also serious damage to property , residential building and cultural monument .
the solidarity fund is an instrument of paramount importance to the eu .
the union is based on the concept of solidarity .
solidarity is the main feature of the european union .
people became destitute , and many of them lost almost everything they had .
important area such a tourism and industry were severely damaged .
i would like to thank member for supporting this report .
the flood of 2010 affected several european country , to varying degree .
the loss caused by this disaster exceed eur 2.9 billion .
almost a year ha already passed since the flood .
it is just a pity that it is overdue .
portugal still ha the five longliners it had before .
the fishery sector in the region of the comoros is very specific .
i welcome the proposal to establish this new protocol .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
this report make the following recommendation , which are considered relevant :
for the above reason , i voted in favour of this report .
the eu fishing fleet is in operation throughout the world .
for this reason , i have voted in favour of the report .
a draft agreement wa initialled with jordan on 9 december 2009 .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
bilateral trade agreement should always be fully compatible with the multilateral trading system .
the commission need to ensure that the implementation is effective .
lingering dispute have a negative effect on the business community .
my vote in favour wa motivated by each of these fact .
the dispute settlement mechanism is modelled on standard international procedure .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
the commission must ensure that the mechanism is effectively and efficiently implemented .
egypt is inseparably bound up in the history of europe and the world .
i hope that it will have a future a great a it past .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
resolving dispute by diplomatic mean guarantee equality of treatment between country .
the commission must ensure that the mechanism is effectively and efficiently implemented .
i welcome the decision by the european parliament to support these agreement .
ukraine is one of the most important partner in poland 's eastern policy .
benefit are announced , without making it clear where they will come from .
this will help to promote the exchange of scientific knowledge and research .
for this reason , i am in favour of this project .
this will enable ukraine to gradually come closer to the eu .
relation between the european union and ukraine have been up and down .
with a population of 46 million , ukraine need stability in the region .
we know what it mean to live on europe 's external border .
the great debate surrounding this report is a side issue to it motivation .
this position wa supported by the opinion of the committee on legal affair .
that is why the adoption of this report is important .
i support that arrangement and i voted 'for ' .
in writing . - ukip meps abstained on the amendment to this report .
i therefore voted against the amended proposal and against the legislative resolution .
hence , our critical position a regard this report .
restriction on the use of accelerated procedure will further increase all these difficulty .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
all un member state have an obligation to protect refugee and asylum seeker .
above all , we must achieve greater consistency between asylum instrument .
furthermore , we must enhance the minimum procedural safeguard .
particular attention must be paid to vulnerable asylum applicant .
in writing . - ( de ) i have voted against the report .
asylum policy should be an act of humanity and solidarity .
about 7 million overseas tourist visit ireland every year .
currently , 1.8 million enterprise and 9.7 million job depend on european tourism .
to this end , i support this report on statistical information and tourism .
the distinction between internal and national tourism is drawn in the report .
politician need to acknowledge the great importance of the tourism industry to europe .
let me end with a simple message - visit britain !
the treaty of lisbon ha increased the eu 's responsibility for tourism .
for this reason , these statistic represent a significant element of policy making .
tourism therefore represents the third largest socio-economic activity in the eu .
however , there is still potential for further growth .
that is why i voted in favour of the report .
i voted in favour of the report for those reason .
tourism is an important economic activity in the eu .
within the eu , the tourism statistic system is governed by directive 95/57/ec .
several element of the legislation have evolved since the adoption of this regulation .
it constitutes an important european union financial instrument in the area of fishery .
in writing . - i wa able to support mr ferreira 's report .
this is a sine qua non of sustainable fishery development .
environmental and health monitoring and surveillance could accordingly be carried out .
at present , the sustainability of the fishery sector is particularly important .
the investment entailed could make control system more efficient and cheaper to operate .
the regulation is an important instrument for implementing the common fishery policy .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
for this reason , i voted in favour of mr ferreira 's report .
this is a sine qua non of sustainable fishery development .
i voted for the report on fishery and establishing transitional technical measure .
however , the commission wa unable to table a draft regulation .
in writing . - 'no more discard ! ' cry the commission .
today 's vote mean that this obscenity will continue for another 18 month .
it is up to parliament to propose an estimate .
i shall await the commission 's proposal on this matter .
this report allows u to examine objectively the european parliament 's 2012 budget .
this will definitely need to be a tight austerity budget .
in 2012 , we must improve the situation of young people .
the target that are set must relate primarily to young people .
they need support to enable them to become integrated into the labour market .
the rapporteur ha also had to fight against misinformation and demagoguery .
we therefore chose to abstain in the final vote .
we believe that it should have been possible to identify further saving .
it requires an amendment to the statute for member .
this report doe not refer to the guideline for the eu general budget .
however , it can not be separated from the present situation .
for all these reason , we voted against this report .
this is particularly a result of cut in expenditure on building .
that is why i voted in favour of this report .
the reduction in the total amount should therefore be welcomed .
i object to yet another increase in parliament 's budget .
these two latter point will be the subject of an amending budget later .
i support the draft resolution regarding health claim on food intended for child .
this is a defeat for family with young baby .
but the synthesised dha added to formula milk is different .
the promotion of food using claim may mislead consumer and contravene scientific advice .
that is why there is opposition to adopting the commission 's draft regulation .
however , the synthesised dha which is added to formula milk is different .
the claim ha been authorised , based on evidence supplied by mead johnson .
for this reason , i share the opinion of the rapporteur .
however , it should also serve to make consumer more aware .
it is obvious that breast milk is the best food for newborn child .
politician should also have faith in the decision of the safety authority .
the european policy must protect biodiversity and support technology transfer and infrastructure improvement .
protecting investor should remain the top priority in investment agreement .
this report address the problem of future european international investment policy .
we are all well aware of what multinationals do .
they stay whilst they obtain massive profit and grant .
portugal , unfortunately , know this situation only too well .
i think he is right , especially on the latter point .
investment risk is generally higher in developing and le developed country .
we must also have maximum influence in international investment negotiation .
the report call for a real balance between public and private interest .
i voted in favour of this resolution on international investment policy .
we need to put an end to these abuse .
protection for our undertaking abroad must be our priority .
the report give priority to protection for all eu investor .
finally , it creates a list of country which will be privileged partner .
that is why i voted for the report by mr arif .
eu taxpayer ' money must be used appropriately and effectively .
the member state must have effective control mechanism and adequate fraud detection capability .
however , it will only be possible if the information is transparent .
these doubt can not simply remain confined to the newspaper .
frankly , at present , the overall recovery rate is low .
innumerable irregularity were found in those area in various member state during 2009 .
at present , the overall recovery rate is far from the desirable level .
this is considered a result of bad reporting by member state .
large amount of eu funding is still spent incorrectly , say the resolution .
anyone who is involved in shoplifting will be caught and punished .
it is not only that the likelihood of being discovered is small .
the generous subsidy system continues to lay itself open to fraud and irregularity .
pre-accession assistance funding ha proved to be especially susceptible .
this report only represents one step in this direction .
italy is , unfortunately , among the country most affected .
concealing the scale of the fraud will not do any good .
however , it must not obscure the complexity of procedure .
the inclusion of reference to political foundation is also positive .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
it call on the european commission to make specific proposal in this regard .
there is an urgent need to re-appropriate european issue .
political party at european level have considerable scope for action .
i rejected this report for a number of reason .
they are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayer ' money .
the huge european subsidy granted to these party is a scandal .
they contribute towards giving shape to the political will of the people .
they are also crucial in training and selecting their candidate .
the same go for the proposal being made on the respective political foundation .
it is important to develop the european political party .
this ha been evident in the poor turnout in parliamentary election .
the funding of european political party ' work must be transparent .
i am supporting the report by my fellow member mr giannakou .
furthermore , the financial rule applying to the political party must be modified .
i do not want that , hence my protest vote .
governance and partnership are two key issue in reviving the single market .
we need a change in mentality and attitude from everyone involved .
we would protect our market and our industry by sending the wto packing !
this directive is one of the cornerstone of a functioning internal market .
i have voted for the adoption of this report .
another key aspect is the provision of ongoing education and training for worker .
we need to return to a secure labour market .
some outstanding issue are not assessed with due attention .
i would not like these problem to recur with increasing frequency .
the european commission ha to incorporate fundamental right into all single market legislation .
one priority that ha been identified is an alternative method of conflict resolution .
on this point , i am disappointed that we neglected collective redress .
i hope to see this translated into effective legislative measure by the commission .
i agree with the rapporteur that we must choose more appropriate legislative measure .
however , the second proposal , in particular , is the essential one .
i voted in favour of mr kalniete 's report .
i voted for this report because we need to make progress .
it is also still just a difficult for small and medium-sized business .
i therefore encourage the commission to present legislative proposal in this area .
many of the proposal featuring in it overlap with various other initiative .
citizen need to feature at the heart of the single market .
this point is clearly stated in the document 's introduction .
we voted in favour of the report on a single market for european .
the report contains many important proposal for the development of the single market .
in our opinion , both of these are national matter .
we can no longer consider developing a single market without greater citizen involvement .
indeed , this criticism wa included in mr campos 's final report .
this will contribute to a rapid return to growth in the good sector .
we therefore voted against , a we did the two other report .
these measure will make citizen the centre point of the internal market .
their specific need will be matched by specific measure .
our citizen must be at the heart of the single market project .
we should give thought to whether policy ought not to be truly citizen-centred .
i have therefore decided to abstain from the vote on this report .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
citizen need to be placed at the heart of the single market .
we believe we established it a quarter of a century ago .
an energy market is a new area of eu policy .
consequently , it is very important to avoid distortion of competition .
the single market will remain competitive if all social right are respected .
barrier to the free movement of worker must be removed .
this single market act will be under discussion until 28 february 2011 .
we must lift protectionist barrier to be able to revitalise the single market .
the european single market is of fundamental significance for both business and consumer .
the digital single market should also be an important part of the economy .
the report contains many important proposal for the development of the single market .
tax rate remain a matter for the member state .
in addition , we are waiting for the european commission 's proposed legislation .
the european union ha a unique economy , boasting 500 million consumer .
it is critical during time of austerity to increase growth in our economy .
this is another report from the package on consolidating the single market .
today , europe ha become the world 's biggest economy .
therefore , it is very important to encourage sustainable economic growth .
only sustainable growth can guarantee the creation of sustainable job .
smes are the driving force of europe 's economy .
there are also dramatic development going on in the e-world .
currently , the eu is not really competitive on e-markets .
the single market is an important goal to be reached .
this will help improve the whole european union 's global competitiveness significantly .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
only sustainable growth can guarantee the creation of sustainable job
for this , the free movement of service is needed .
innovation provide a basis for strong and more sustainable growth and job creation .
it is noted that public procurement procedure must be more rational .
innovation and creativity are known to be factor in growth .
it is also necessary to keep existing health and safety provision for worker .
the first is long-term innovation for supporting the ecological transformation of economy .
today , europe ha become the world 's biggest economy .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the european council stated this clearly on 25 march .
safety concern are , of course , not restricted to nuclear energy .
a such , everyone is free to decide upon their energy mix .
since then , we have been drawing up the test criterion .
a total of 14 member state use nuclear power and 13 do not .
germany is currently investigating shortening the operational time span of it power station .
we need to properly investigate the considered action and risk .
mr president , nuclear power differs from other energy source .
nuclear power can not be regulated and monitored at national level alone .
we do not have a sufficiently diverse energy mix .
today , many european are concerned about nuclear safety here in europe .
all fact should be made public under the supervision of the commission .
today , that is the only credible alternative for this technology .
i would like to explain to you briefly why this is the case .
please make the name of these power plant public .
their measured content is in contrast with some other contribution .
i am glad to see you agree with me , mr harm .
in this parliament , we condemn crime against humanity .
that energy ha always come from a variety of source .
it express what unites u , not what divide u .
mr president , stress test on technical standard are not enough .
these are the only one that are completely safe .
the time for a parochial approach to nuclear safety ha long since gone .
we need to go much further than we have in the past .
paragraph 21 and 22 show the direction in which we want to go .
we want more renewable energy and more energy efficiency .
it is also a potentially dangerous form of energy .
next , the fight against climate change requires a coherent and ambitious policy .
finally , true solidarity requires the creation of an energy community .
i think that we are all aware of that .
event such a these have always led to technical improvement and safety measure .
people do not stop flying after major air disaster .
nuclear plant must be ready to withstand extreme natural disaster .
we can perhaps postpone them until the week after next .
a large majority of this house wa against the highest safety standard .
parliament ha no contribution to make to this debate .
you know that we have totally opposing position on this subject .
the sweater that i am wearing today is 30 year old .
in those day , we were demonstrating against nuclear power .
therefore , we can expect a reactor accident to happen every 25 year .
is it so bad not to change your view about something ?
that is a major change in comparison to my previous view .
you may see that a being satisfactory or a unsatisfactory .
it would be good if we could adopt this resolution unanimously .
that said , i think we should start from two important consideration .
any nuclear plant which is not safe should be closed down .
this tragic anniversary ha unfortunately coincided with the event in japan .
there are currently 165 operational reactor in europe , not including russia .
we must ask what guarantee can be given of their safety ?
this is why we must attach greater importance to nuclear safety .
there ha been a lack of clear and transparent communication .
careful thought on the development of future energy policy is essential .
finally , we should open a debate involving citizen and local authority .
she talk about only one nuclear plant in japan having been hit .
however , there were six nuclear plant , not one .
how many would be enough for her to change her opinion ?
how many accident will it take to change my mind ?
we know that there are a number of plant in japan .
we have to learn something from each such incident .
there is one more question i have not answered .
however , we should try to draw some positive conclusion from the disaster .
another lesson is that we must establish a european civil protection body .
therefore , the stress test must cover an accumulation of different risk .
investment must be made in research into the efficient production of renewable energy .
the nuclear safety directive must be revised in order to tighten requirement .
the stress test proposed by the commission are necessary .
the test must be carried out with the commission 's involvement .
the test ' result must be used when revising the directive .
the consequence of the test must be very clear .
those which pas continue to operate , those which fail stop .
the only drawback is that they will not be compulsory .
the eu is now coyly asking if these could possibly be carried out .
another failing is that the eu ha not drawn up common standard .
it is imperative , however , that these should exist .
thirdly , an independent body should carry out these test .
i have a question to put to our commissioner , mr oettinger .
it is about the implementation of these stress test .
it is the only guarantee that there will be no further accident .
do you really want to irradiate the people of europe ?
you should withdraw this implementing regulation immediately and preferably today .
we must invest in and make use of alternative energy .
they are safe , environmentally friendly and le harmful to people .
mr president , this debate should be about nuclear safety .
it ha obviously gone further than that and is about the energy mix .
what follow-up will there be on those safety assessment ?
we need to look at the safety of plant now .
let u move to another stage of looking at the energy mix .
let u be honest : renewables are not an easy answer either .
i believe that we can not praise this development process highly enough .
a total of 35 % renewable energy in nine year !
in poland , 90 % of electricity is currently generated using coal .
incidentally , poland is currently planning a new nuclear power station .
we german in particular should not think that we always know better .
this is why my plan include the option of coal without co2 emission .
some speaker have mentioned the fact that the authority should be independent .
thank you very much , i have been following it with keen attention .
comprehensive , independent and transparent stress test must begin immediately .
stress test on nuclear facility represent a step forward .
we are talking about more than 400 nuclear reactor worldwide .
i welcome the introduction of 'stress test ' a soon a possible .
the preventive inspection carried out showed that both reactor are operating safely .
they generate approximately 20 % of the country 's energy consumption .
however , these measure should be targeted in the right direction .
at the moment , safety is our top priority .
i support the development of new technology and especially renewable energy source .
private capital maximises profit , even at the cost of neglecting safety measure .
nuclear energy should always be under state and international control .
yes , we must phase out nuclear power - that is clear .
however , it is impossible to do this overnight .
in belgium alone , 55 % of our electricity come from nuclear energy .
that is why we must act on two level .
the least expensive , least polluting and least dangerous energy is unconsumed energy .
event have recently taken a dramatic turn in syria .
allow me now to move more specifically to the three country before u .
the high representative ha spoken with the foreign minister directly to this end .
this would have clear and worrying implication for regional stability .
the best way to preserve and promote stability remains dialogue .
the brutal repression with which they have been met is unacceptable .
the eu will continue to press syria on delivering reform without delay .
in yemen , the situation remains of the utmost concern .
time is running out and the victim will be the yemeni people .
mr president , i entirely agree with what you have just said .
obviously , that is not why we established the treaty of lisbon .
finally , there is the question of double standard .
the letter we received from baroness ashton is no strategy .
it is unacceptable that eu country are still selling arm to these regime .
i repeat that it is time to take action .
that can only evoke our enthusiasm and our support .
we know what to do ; we have instrument for bypassing these obstacle .
i still have before me a completely blank sheet .
there wa nothing proactive in the agenda you outlined .
europe continues to sell arm that are being used to kill civilian .
whether agreement of this kind will then be kept is another question altogether .
meanwhile , i agree that raul is a great footballer .
we must act with force to stop this violence .
this is the basic warning to prevent further violence against protestors now .
the image of violence which we are seeing are horrifying .
all of these thing have already been mentioned here .
i watched the speech made by president assad of syria live .
should we not be taking urgent action on this ?
the presence of a major oil refinery for saudi crude is well known .
reliable source have identified iranian influence on the shi'ite population of bahrain .
there are a couple of principle which need to be upheld .
what is the eu doing to promote that investigation ?
what is the eu doing specifically to foster this dialogue ?
i would just like to address a comment to the commissioner .
the eu ha been dismayingly ambiguous regarding bahrain , in particular .
it may be asked : what can the eu do ?
well , our resolution which will be adopted tomorrow make some suggestion .
i believe that the lisbon treaty gave the european parliament additional responsibility .
the situation in syria is very serious and it stake the highest .
we should also consider policy action in yemen and bahrain .
we have been told about very many concrete measure .
in contrast , bahrain is a relatively modern and progressive constitutional monarchy .
our job is to make friend in these country .
i hope that we will soon be taking action of this kind .
the question of iranian interference in bahrain 's domestic affair wa raised .
i consider it very important that this neighbourhood policy be unified .
in western term , they are undoubtedly undemocratic system .
the seven estonian citizen are told to be alive .
emerging economy should also provide their fair share of assistance to ldcs .
global partnership and mutual responsibility are vital for the success of the conference .
the potential of trade a an engine for growth and employment is considerable .
these country have worked for better governance and mobilised their own financial resource .
the list of the poorest country ha remained virtually unchanged for decade .
it is therefore absurd and cynical to say that development is not working .
we have not given it enough of a chance .
the un conference in istanbul will have to draw some conclusion from this .
country with democracy achieve fair distribution much faster than dictatorship .
good governance will bring u closer to achieving the millennium development goal .
we also need to do more for public health .
for a family in a poor country , disease is a financial disaster .
disease is a luxury which no one can afford .
this increase should mean that we have sufficient mean to eradicate extreme poverty .
firstly , we must target the poorest country in our cooperation programme .
they need to do the bulk of the work .
we can do nothing more and nothing le than that .
gradually , this parliament turned it into 'anything but farm ' .
it is not aid but trade that is going to reduce poverty .
if the west stopped these payment , normal african would not even notice .
it is only government official who would be hard hit .
one of these is the promotion of inclusive growth .
it is equally important to safeguard policy coherence for development .
so we convert eur 2 million to eur 235 million .
that is what we do with our fishery policy .
( el ) mr president , mr deva is right .
the poorest country are very susceptible to war , crisis and widespread poverty .
we set target for eliminating extreme poverty in those country .
indeed , a mr deva suggested , trade play a very important role .
the country ha also achieved good result in applying the developing eu acquis .
the council therefore encouraged iceland to continue this practice .
i am convinced that iceland 's accession can become a success story .
it may give impetus to the entire enlargement policy and enhance it success .
the motto and goal of the hungarian presidency is a strong europe .
this stage of the negotiation process will be completed by june 2011 .
enhanced debt restructuring will help to strengthen economic recovery .
iceland excels in this respect , with a strong tradition of democracy .
at the same time , these measure must be implemented rigorously .
iceland ha made significant progress , a mr preda said .
with regard to whaling , i make no apology for it .
it is also said that iceland want the security of the euro .
even portugal 's own bank are currently refusing to buy portuguese bond .
but that is not the message coming from icelander .
seventy-five percent of icelander wisely do not trust the eu .
i really want to emphasise what ha been said here .
i also understand very well that the icelander are interested in fishing .
by that , i do not mean that it is wrong .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur .
perhaps the eu and it member state could copy iceland 's sensible approach .
what exactly are they going to bring to our european club ?
in 2005 , iceland landed 367 tonne of north-east atlantic mackerel .
this year , they intend to land 150 000 tonne .
that is an increase of over 6 500 % , lady and gentleman .
iceland need to put forward a more realistic proposal .
have we considered adequately what iceland 's added value would be for europe ?
it would be the smallest country in the eu in term of population .
the situation may be improving , but only very slowly .
mr president , lady and gentleman , thank you for this debate .
let u trust them with this ; this is their task .
a we know , iceland began accession negotiation in july 2010 .
iceland 's progress on the road to eu membership is evident .
it is important to reach agreement on the question of fishing quota .
the prospect of iceland 's accession ha been well received .
another question is the dispute over the size of mackerel catch .
we all realise that this conflict jeopardises the accession negotiation with iceland .
2010 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia
i congratulate you on the balanced finding of the draft resolution .
the text objectively reflects the situation at hand , and formulates valuable recommendation .
individual performance must always be acknowledged by the eu .
the perspective of the early election requires special attention .
the stability of the current coalition is remarkable despite the difficulty .
the report is comprehensive , accurate and set out the challenge ahead .
secondly , the european perspective ha been a great incentive for progress .
yet i must share with you my preoccupation with recent development .
development so far this year have not shown the expected progress .
the commission expects due process and non-selective application of the law .
the fight against corruption also need to be pursued vigorously .
2011 is an important year for the whole region .
it is important that skopje play an active part .
it is therefore essential that the name issue is solved .
both party have repeated their commitment to finding a solution .
i hope that they are able to capitalise on these effort this year .
this is very important for the country 's ownership .
the key problem is resolving the name dispute with greece .
this will enable the negotiation to conclude much more quickly in the future .
we are expecting serious effort in term of guaranteeing medium freedom and independence .
the instability come from the european union 's action .
did you know that or do you really believe what you said ?
this is not the way that political discourse should be conducted .
it is our duty and responsibility to stimulate positive change in this country .
i do not believe that this assessment must take priority .
on the other hand , it unambiguously call for the opening of negotiation .
the country complies with the criterion and deserves that .
the accession dialogue that commissioner füle just mentioned sound promising in that respect .
this is an important issue and should be resolved before accession negotiation commence .
in my view , he enjoys a presumption of innocence .
nevertheless , i have listened to fellow member putting forward unprecedented theory .
you must have an interest in resolving the problem .
mr füle referred to the ohrid framework agreement , which represented major progress .
macedonia is ready to begin talk on eu accession .
however , there is still room for improvement in key area .
macedonia ha substantially reduced the number of rom who are without personal document .
both country have an exemplary record a far a minority are concerned .
in croatia , the opposition ha largely taken a constructive approach .
in macedonia , the socialist opposition ha used brutal blocking tactic .
a the discussion ha shown , we all agree on this important point .
they will have all our support in this endeavour .
let me tell you my personal view ; it is unacceptable .
although everyone else is free to help , it ultimately depends on them .
we therefore continuously encourage this dialogue and this search for a solution .
it should be important for u to finally be able to make progress .
i am both pleased and sad that we are having this debate today .
the obstacle is the dispute with greece over name .
without this , the talk would probably have started already .
the commission should submit relevant alternative proposal in this direction .
this is because it undermines the credibility of the eu a a whole .
however , it ha fallen noticeably over the long term .
mr gbagbo should therefore be brought to justice to answer for his act .
he ha won the war but must now win the peace .
the administration must start functioning again so that public service can be provided .
the eu ha stood by côte d'ivoire throughout the long year of crisis .
some eur 500 million ha been disbursed since 2003 .
the eu should continue to accompany côte d'ivoire at this crucial moment .
it is now time to start working to implement peace in côte d'ivoire .
we must not lose sight of the bigger picture .
his relentless refusal to respect the voter ' wish merit strong condemnation .
however , there is an emergency situation in côte d'ivoire .
the international criminal court must be allowed to do it work .
the sanction have had an impact : gbagbo ha been financially drained .
justice can involve vengeance , but it can also bring peace .
what a start to a new period of governance !
we are all aware of france 's role in africa .
françafrique ha caused a lot of harm and continues to do so .
neutralising heavy weaponry is another name for a bombardment .
so i think we need to put an end to this hypocrisy .
we took brutal action in favour of one camp and against another .
yet you are completely impervious to this particular scandal .
( call of 'off the subject ' from the chamber )
the surrounding country can not cope with the current volume of refugee .
the eu must help organise election and the construction of democratic institution .
normal business should not , however , be prevented .
côte d'ivoire is the most prosperous economy in west africa .
the legitimacy of both claimant to the presidency is in dispute .
the army of both side are responsible for massacring the civilian population .
what ha happened to the principle of international law ?
is this the concept on which the un wa founded ?
whatever happens , the chaos in abidjan will last for several month .
this is the view of the african union and of many other body .
for this reason , we should not quibble over this .
of course , this doe not resolve the problem .
the african union should have helped to bring about democracy in côte d'ivoire .
however , in this case , the mistake are someone else 's responsibility .
clearly , the basic democratic principle of respecting election result must be upheld .
there is a danger that tension between the two camp will intensify .
what do we plan to do if civil war break out ?
it is time to put a stop to this .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20:35 and resumed at 21:00 )
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity : see minute
the next item is the joint debate on the commission statement on :
review of the european neighbourhood policy - southern dimension .
i am pleased that our thought are along the same line .
regulatory reform made by a partner country are encouraged through trade .
the neighbourhood policy will seek improvement to mobility without losing sight of security .
what are the country like which are included in the policy ?
finally , let u say something about the conflict .
madam president , the eastern partnership is still very new .
however , i do not agree with the analysis of the cause .
quite obviously , what we need is a different approach .
our country ha been paralysed by fear again . ' unquote .
alexeyivich urged lukashenko to resume dialogue with the people .
( el ) madam president , i thank the commissioner for his comment .
we need a long-term strategic plan for growth and stability in the region .
that is why we need clear priority and quantifiable target in advance .
i would like to say a few word about the eastern partnership .
other member will be speaking about the southern partnership .
we are concerned about a possible new conflict between azerbaijan and armenia .
consequently , we need to learn lesson for the future .
we are not thinking about sharing wealth but about sharing security .
they have demonstrated that democracy and human right can be universal value .
i would like a detailed answer to my question , commissioner .
now , all of a sudden , we are taking action against them .
this would also be a way to guarantee their continuity .
a a parliament in a free europe , we must ...
at this point , the eastern partnership cease to be an instrument ...
we have 15 programme with a budget of eur 1.1 billion .
i have not seen the document pertaining to that .
i have a feeling that some thing really need to be modified .
we must facilitate access to european market and allow greater mobility .
this should all happen within the framework of a revitalised euro-mediterranean dialogue .
at stake is the strategic , political future of europe .
these policy need fundamental change ; we must finally open a new chapter .
a consistent european union policy is needed on these matter today .
this is necessary to be able to pursue the policy effectively .
secondly , we need a clear diagnosis of the situation .
with regard to the southern neighbourhood , i shall make three point .
we therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue .
lady and gentleman , we are facing a major challenge .
these congratulation are not offered simply out of courtesy .
however , we need to make it more dynamic and more effective .
i find it fatal to oppose the southern neighbourhood and the eastern neighbourhood .
also , we should not mix up status quo with stability .
we should move into a kind of transitional approach .
we should pay equal attention to both south and east .
i know how difficult it is to talk about financing today .
but this policy ha to be redesigned and that also requires additional financing .
the enp should become more flexible , proactive and optimised .
thirdly , the attractiveness of eu assistance is also important .
i hope very much that we will maintain a ...
madam president , neighbourhood is the key word here .
that is something that the european union should practise a a policy .
if they are not , then one ha more of a problem .
commissioner füle , what are your thought on that option ?
the revolution in the arab world ha shown this to be a fallacy .
everyone we met talked about freedom , justice and democracy .
we agreed to have the european union a a global player .
we wanted that to be reflected in our neighbourhood policy .
we left the more difficult question for the strategic enp review .
the third give support to inclusive and sustainable growth among our neighbour .
should we shy away from offering our thought on these issue ?
do not expect a very technical straightjacket for bilateral relation with our neighbour .
expect only very few , but very clear and very important benchmark .
it is not going to be an easy process .
the higher our ambition are , the more resource they will require .
the jasmine revolution wa very much about dignity and equity .
parliament ha a very important role to play in this regard .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 april .
this also hold true with regard to the eastern dimension of the policy .
i trust that the polish presidency will treat this matter a a priority .
europe should deal with it neighbourhood , and not with prioritised neighbour .
there is no place for a 'russia first ' policy in this domain .
i insist that the eu should seriously consider these problem .
use of sexual violence in conflict in north africa and the middle east
there is nothing to encourage the reporting of such attack .
woman continue to endure discriminatory law and deeply entrenched cultural inequality .
there are plan to introduce local strategy in conflict zone in 2011 .
the training of staff play a very important role in this respect .
you will definitely have the support of the european parliament for this work .
there are so many opportunity , but there are also danger .
i consider that sexual violence is the worst sort of warfare .
it is a sorry tale and can no longer be tolerated .
the vote will take place on thursday , 7 april .
war and conflict often bring unimaginable evil out of such people .
another subject which i want to touch on is project bond .
are we entitled to place such great hope on this financial instrument ?
at the same time , these list are still not enough .
i should like to thank your rapporteur , mr cutaş , in particular .
i mentioned the rsff , the risk sharing finance facility for research .
consequently , we are going to continue this effort .
if the european union so wish , the eib can be that arm .
i would like to say a couple of word on financial instrument .
i am glad to see your support for this initiative in your report .
the legitimate question today is to ask where that funding can come from .
we will have national budget in a mood of further cut .
compliment also on the overview which he gave u here .
the same applies to our relationship with developing country .
there , too , a public bank is vital .
such a bank must observe the treaty of lisbon and it objective .
mr president , mr maystadt , i wanted to stress one point .
we genuinely need long-term investment , and your institution play a major role .
i believe that that is the very least we should expect .
the first point concern the issue of tax haven .
the third point is about measuring the benefit of your action .
you measure them in financial term too , of course .
lastly , the final point of my speech will relate to climate change .
the report specifically state that you must pursue all the eu 's objective .
( fr ) i have a very simple answer to that .
however , there also appear to be other problem apart from transparency .
project that do not meet these standard should be excluded from support .
you have now raised some criticism of this development cooperation .
i have never heard so much nonsense in my life .
thirdly , there is the change in energy policy .
those action must be pursued and , if possible , increased .
the european investment bank need to deliver more , better , faster result .
the availability of such funding ha diminished a a result of the crisis .
my question relate to the matter of project bond .
italy itself is also in need of substantial loan and grant .
i therefore consider this to be an absurd imbalance .
i agree with the european commission 's project bond initiative .
the eib 's role in issuing and managing these bond is therefore crucial .
this relates , in particular , to investment in green infrastructure .
these must also be linked to road network in effective transport hub .
the infrastructure must be made into a well-functioning whole .
the european investment bank should be even more active in these key area .
now to my more substantive point about the european investment bank .
the bank must partner accountable and transparent financial intermediary .
strategic long-term investment in europe need to be increased .
we must focus on an infrastructure and cohesion at european level .
speaking of the future , i agree with many speaker here .
that would raise the quality of the bank 's activity yet more .
the financial instrument jessica , jeremie and jasper have provided real benefit .
i congratulate mr cutaş for the excellent report he presented .
in particular , there wa the important issue raised by mr hübner .
the council and parliament still need to accept it , though .
you therefore have a part to play in reviewing the financial rule .
more than 60 000 small business benefited from them in 2010 .
we are therefore bound to strictly apply european rule and policy .
moreover , we have acknowledged experience and expertise in certain area .
we clearly need investment and sustainable development project in the european union .
a a result , they can be administered without applying the current restriction .
it will be possible to administer them to a much wider extent .
procedure are moving very quickly a far a this matter is concerned .
mr president , i have a statement rather than a question .
the vote wa not unanimous because i did not vote in favour .
such a delay would only cause further damage to farmer .
today , it is a reality and we have had our first epidemic .
that is also important for u a legislator to understand .
i want to go back to the area of the correlation table .
mr president , my thanks to the rapporteur for this report .
being in an exclusion zone can be disastrous for a farmer 's livelihood .
it will allow freer movement of animal and save money in rural area .
this is an urgent issue and common sense must prevail .
in particular , the flourishing trade in breeding cattle collapsed .
despite vaccination , export were completely paralysed in some country .
we must take the time now to take preventive action .
the disease ha not been eradicated and could re-emerge at any time .
we need to learn from experience and be able to offer assistance quickly .
what wa true ten year ago no longer applies .
i would also like to thank the rapporteur for having worked so quickly .
the country therefore need to elaborate vaccination strategy and also implement these .
naturally , that is not the end of it .
however , my view of the measure is a positive one .
there are two thing that we now particularly need .
firstly , we need a rapid solution concerning practice in the european union .
several of you referred to the problem of correlation table .
we are fully aware of the urgency of this matter .
what we need is approval of this proposal by the legislator .
once we have that , we can proceed very quickly .
it is very often difficult to find one 's way around eu legislation .
thank you all once again for your cooperation on this report .
eu tomato import from morocco ( petition 1565/2009 ) ( debate )
i think this is a subject we should focus on .
i would like to know what the commission intends to do .
this will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime .
fraud is being committed , and you know it .
if they fail in their duty , the commission must act .
the commission would have u approve a new agreement with morocco .
it is up to the commission to resolve this issue .
this situation ha been going on for 16 year .
firstly , there must be clear control of the quantity of import permitted .
secondly , the quality of the product must also be controlled .
clearly , we are sensitive to the issue of morocco 's development .
furthermore , i should like to alert the commission to another point .
the current average annual level is 300 000 tonne .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11:35 and resumed at 12:00 )
i believe the rapporteur would also like the floor .
fourth united nation conference on the least developed country (
( ro ) madam president , i would like u to replace :
you have two , could you try the other one .
'enter into constructive talk ' with 'continue the constructive talk ' .
2010 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia (
at best , this report will harbour a seed of doubt .
we indeed have a new rapporteur who ha taken over the report .
madam president , we should not enter into this propaganda exercise .
there wa broad agreement between all political group on this report .
it wa adopted by the committee on foreign affair by an overwhelming majority .
otherwise , we could all request roll call when we felt like it .
( parliament agreed to the request for a roll-call vote )
review of the european neighbourhood policy - eastern dimension (
review of the european neighbourhood policy - southern dimension (
use of sexual violence in conflict in north africa and the middle east (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
if not , would the commissioner say why not ?
it is the prerogative of each institution to react .
you have been heard and we will see what happens .
madam president , i ask : is the answer yes or no ?
bluetongue affect the sheep and cattle on our farm .
it also need to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive .
neither of these proposal received a majority in the vote .
we need concrete measure to increase people 's feeling of safety .
safety is all well and good , but it is not enough .
a moratorium is not enough ; we need to go further than that .
these lesson tell u that there is no such thing a theoretical safety .
i particularly address this to those member who were demanding more .
should we demolish all similar structure in the eu , just in case ?
nuclear technology is not at fault in japan ; the location is .
on the other hand , that is only natural .
nevertheless , there is absolutely no cause for misplaced hysteria on this scale .
that is the reason why i wished to make this explanation .
it is particularly worrying that the whole region is threatened .
using force against your own citizen is a violation of every law .
using live ammunition is indefensible and demand categorical condemnation .
in any case , syria ha been under emergency law since 1963 .
this ha allowed the execution of people without trial .
nevertheless , a european , we should try to export and promote them .
madam president , i abstained on the 2010 report on iceland .
the european union ha promised the balkan country an opportunity for enlargement .
we should all take a look in the mirror .
everything should be done to bring those guilty of crime to justice .
the result of democratic election must be complied with in full .
widening the intellectual base through scholarship programme also requires additional fund .
i am in favour of this report , which amends directive 2000/75/ec .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
however , scientific advance have allowed the creation of new inactivated vaccine .
a change to the current directive is therefore needed .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
animal epidemic can still destroy the livelihood of farmer .
the flexibility called for will allow farmer to protect their animal .
the consequence were serious , both for livestock and for farmer .
bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminant such a cattle , sheep and goat .
these can be used successfully outside area subject to animal movement restriction .
we must react to the nuclear accident in japan .
that doe not mean that we should draw any hasty conclusion .
we have immediately cleared the way for a thorough investigation under european supervision .
the pro-nuclear lobby still have a bright future ahead of them !
yet the european parliament doe not have a position on nuclear power .
i voted against this joint motion for a resolution .
in writing . - i am disappointed by the voting on this resolution .
this is why i abstained on the final vote .
this motion for a resolution wa not the best .
however , the situation in the fukushima nuclear plant remains a threat .
a similar situation to the one in japan could happen anywhere in europe .
cooperation at the european level , however , is essential .
maybe such a referendum ought to be carried out at eu level .
the resolution point only to energy from renewable source .
there is no such thing a zero risk in life full stop .
we must do all we can to minimise that risk .
for the moment , however , we do not have any credible alternative .
i am pleased that the european parliament rejected this resolution .
it will hinder the development of much safer new-generation plant .
the disaster in japan ha awakened people 's concern over nuclear safety .
we are opposed to a ban on the whole idea of nuclear power .
i will do everything i can to work towards this .
i welcomed the fact that the majority voted against the resolution .
the structure of the energy mix is member state ' responsibility .
we therefore need to go further in ensuring safety and improving safety testing .
these two criterion would be a minimum condition for reaching an agreement .
we must therefore go further than increased safety and safety test .
we must draft a european plan to phase out nuclear power forthwith .
it is a crime against humanity not to start preparing for it now .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
the principle of immediately shutting down plant that fail the 'stress test ' .
how much doe it cost to close first- and second-generation power station ?
furthermore , how much doe it cost to dispose of radioactive waste ?
the only truly safe nuclear power is no nuclear power .
hence , my 'no ' vote in the final vote .
but this school of thought is bordering on outright superstition .
the nuclear reactor of fukushima wa hit by an unprecedented combination of catastrophe .
nuclear energy ha a much safer record than any other source of energy .
in other word , look at iran , not japan .
however , those state are not the only one with democratic aspiration .
large-scale movement have also emerged in bahrain , yemen and syria .
i call on their government to embark on fruitful dialogue with the demonstrator .
this resolution is another example of the hypocrisy of the majority of parliament .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
yet this is not making the opposition a fully democratic alternative .
i am voting for this motion for a resolution .
why the monumental failure of the aid to africa ?
we have the resource at our disposal to eradicate poverty .
these are even increased by the benefit of scientific and technological development .
in my opinion , they should be subordinated to it .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
i therefore wish to congratulate the people of cape verde and their government .
first of all , iceland ha a long tradition of democracy .
it ha been hard hit by the economic , financial and banking crisis .
reform must be undertaken , and we must encourage them .
in writing . - i voted against this report .
i believe that the union will gain from the icelandic contribution .
negotiation on iceland 's accession started in july 2010 .
it obliges them rigorously to apply the copenhagen criterion .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
iceland ha been a candidate country for european union membership since 2010 .
in this context , cooperation with greece is of paramount importance .
at the same time , political dialogue ha now ground to a halt .
it give the country lesson in democracy and even in journalism .
the status of reform since 2001 can be judged positively in many respect .
attack are being intentionally directed against un peacekeeper and institution .
this resolution is a master class in bad faith .
a fine demonstration of effectiveness and usefulness that is !
indeed , you only support the result that suit you .
parliament therefore call on president ouattara to facilitate peace and national reconciliation .
respect for democracy is an inalienable principle of the eu .
we must therefore strongly condemn the event in côte d'ivoire .
if humanitarian law continues to be broken , specific sanction must be imposed .
in this respect , i consider the resolution too one-sided .
i join my voice to those who : 1 .
the post-election violence ha created over a million internally displaced person and refugee .
rather , it is concerned with security policy aspect and increasing stability .
the ultimate goal of an effective neighbourhood policy is to guarantee peace .
the time ha come for solidarity with our neighbour .
we need to rethink our policy on the southern mediterranean .
this text ha the merit of proposing solution for radically rethinking this policy .
in writing . - i voted against this motion .
the eu could not care le about burgeoning democracy .
indeed , many resolution have been adopted by parliament denouncing violence against woman .
it ha long been known that rape and torture are frequent occurrence .
in libya , soldier carried out rape and torture .
i therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
in fact , it ha become one of the tactic of war .
the european union must not remain neutral on this issue .
the eu should focus it effort specifically on woman .
however , smes still face difficulty trying to obtain credit .
this motion for a resolution focus on the analysis of the 2009 report .
however , it option are not always sufficiently transparent and clear .
it need to take on more employee specialised in development .
the eib is currently under-staffed , despite it impact on so-called developing country .
the eib is playing a decisive role in fighting the crisis .
the involvement of and dialogue with local financial intermediary is welcome .
for this reason , i am voting in favour of the report .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
we have the nobel prize-winner who could not attend the meeting in oslo .
it wa at once extremely beautiful and somewhat poignant and sad .
it is a sophisticated china , yet one with something seriously broken inside .
ai weiwei is an heir to china 's magnificent and ancient artistic tradition .
clearly , there is also a lack of freedom of expression in china .
we abhor the chinese government 's disgraceful treatment of this distinguished artist .
he wa arrested on sunday and there is no prospect of his release .
the word 'jasmine ' ha been banned from the chinese internet recently .
punishment of economic crime is the name they give to political repression .
we call for the immediate release of ai weiwei .
we have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall .
it now stand at an incredible usd 95 billion .
the case of ai weiwei is a perfect example .
i would like that noted in the record once more .
that would be a very bad thing , especially for the people concerned .
we call for the immediate release of ai weiwei .
ban on the election for the tibetan government in exile in nepal
the position of the nepalese government is therefore complicated .
mr tannock , you used only one and a half minute .
next time , i will give you an extra half minute !
since then , thing have , in fact , only got worse .
however , we should be pleased that such thing are guaranteed .
such an initiative must be facilitated , wherever it might take place .
this aspect is vital for ensuring an effective neighbourhood policy .
mr verhofstadt said that , to a certain extent , we are hypocrite .
the commission is to blame in all of this , commissioner .
the commissioner for trade is often indifferent towards other european policy .
last june , kathmandu handed over tibetan refugee to the chinese authority .
this is something we have been requesting for a long time now .
bearing in mind the current situation , we can not wait any longer .
we need to be consistent and stand behind this policy of ours .
obviously , nepal is siding with china , under pressure .
this is not the first time this ha happened .
that , however , will not be without it problem .
it ha therefore imposed a voting ban on tibetan group .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on zimbabwe .
you know when mugabe is worried : he start to panic .
his police and militia start attacking anyone they see a opponent .
i suppose mugabe is increasingly nervous on two count .
those who do wrong thing in this country will have their celebration spoiled .
agreement concerning the distribution of power are often problematic .
one of them is the improvement of the human right situation .
that is why we are dealing with human right in this country .
that is why we defend those who struggle for human right .
we are responsible for what is happening in africa .
emotionally , this situation is extremely important to greek .
they are now at risk of being sentenced to death .
let u hope that this will be possible on this occasion .
i should point out that the country 's economic situation is deeply affected .
they never wrote of the people of rhodesia having to go hungry .
what we hear from this country today is simply intolerable .
rhodesia , and later zimbabwe , were the bread basket of southern africa .
i believe that the key to ending this lie in southern africa .
this is exactly what happened again just a couple of month ago .
the eu welcome the region 's effort to mediate in the zimbabwean crisis .
the eu remains the largest provider of development assistance to zimbabwe .
resource are only channelled through un body and specialised ngo .

robert schuman would have been proud of our accomplishment .
the european union is always against the death penalty .

there is an amendment which will shortly be presented by mr speroni .
we must now close our initial discussion on the point regarding wednesday .
rather , it is proof of the complex situation in egypt .
six point are going to be discussed with baroness ashton .
we need a proper debate on what is happening in egypt .
i apologise for having mixed up tuesday and wednesday .
i declare the order of business for the week adopted .
european fishery sector crisis due to rise in oil price ( debate )
small-scale fishing , in particular , is severely affected .
fisherman 's income are also dependent on the price of oil .
this in no way mean increasing parliament 's budget or the european budget .
i am calling for a little more flexibility for the member state .
mr president , the situation in the fishery sector is very serious .
cheap alternative , le tasty too , but that is beside the point .
the duty-free importation of plaice fillet must stop , mr president .
lady and gentleman , we urgently need concrete measure .
i call on you to vote for such action .
we therefore call on the commission to look into this .
yet , why is the income of our fisherman decreasing ?
a far a i can see , there are three reason for this .
i would stress that we can only do what we can .
therefore , most fisherman would not be helped by this at all .
it is likely that fuel price will remain high in the coming year .
this will lead to more abundant fish stock in the mid-term .
many member state are now forced to implement austerity measure .
that is why we urge the member state to use our fund .
this is simply a temporary measure , justified by an urgent situation .
this is , in fact , a collective responsibility .
their profit have gone down because fuel price have gone up .
all of u are suffering because fuel price have gone up .
it is because of the unsustainable fishing practice of decade .
it should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy .
the de minimis principle is intended to apply until 2013 .
it merely caused eu-level concentration of ownership and activity in the sector .
this is why i think it is a huge mistake .
we need to invest in research into cheaper engine that consume le oil .
but is this problem caused by the increase in fuel price ?
of course , now we are discussing fuel price .
this is a problem and we must discus how we can face it .
let me put it clearly so that we understand the situation .
the member state can give their own state aid .
the richer member state can already give it now .
the member state use only 20 % of our funding .
only italy ha asked u for a reallocation and we approved it .
the vote will take place at noon on thursday , 12 may 2011 .
these measure should pay particular attention to small-scale and coastal fishing .
what wa rightly mentioned is that this is a moment of choice .
in addition , wireless is essential in area currently deprived of such access .
we are all aware that broadcasting know no border .
no doubt about that , we are completely on your side .
another nuance between the commission and the rapporteur 's report concern competition .
the commission ha slight difficulty in accepting just two proposal .
a clear statement is needed , the sooner the better .
i hope that we will succeed in doing so in future , too .
they need to be qualitative , not just quantitative , solution .
but let u face it : it will not come easily .
firstly , we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunication market at european level .
that is why we have introduced rule on competition-proofing .
i join with the other shadow rapporteur in thanking him for his work .
this is cutting-edge technology , and it is very important .
it is an asset of which no one can claim exclusive ownership .
the radio spectrum policy programme is therefore of particular importance .
lastly , transparency and the guarantee of well-managed and well-administered frequency allocation .
this topic , this report by mr hökmark , fit that brief perfectly .
good coordination at european level is an obvious requirement in this respect .
let me tell you , those advantage of scale are clocking up .
every year , they can make a difference of eur 80 billion .
at home , one gigabyte cost me eur 1 .
we urgently need to take action in this regard .
we have urgent priority to address in this regard .
broadband technology is undoubtedly an important part of this .
a coordinating role would certainly be desirable , however .
that is probably a consequence of irresolute policy and too much bureaucracy .
we have also talked about creating digital opportunity for every european by 2013 .
there are still hurdle to be overcome , no doubt about that .
spectrum is a national competence : i am aware of that .
however , we need to be able to take decision .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
i therefore hope that parliament will support the proposal .
let me now turn to some of the amendment that have been proposed .
the commission initially proposed applying exceptional measure for a period of three year .
this compromise became the basis for the subsequent request for a wto waiver .
i thank the european parliament for it cooperation on this sensitive issue .
i want to highlight two of these point here .
i believe that we have a difference of opinion on this point .
however , what is the situation in pakistan at the moment ?
we , i am proud to say , reacted fast .
we needed to come up with a new solution to provide help .
at wto level , objection have been registered to our eu proposal .
i believe this house should reaffirm the commission position .
i did so at the time and i do now .
we all have very close tie with the people of this stricken country .
it is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance .
do we want to deliver the final blow to the european textile sector ?
today , the justification is humanitarian aid to pakistan .
yesterday , it wa helping in the fight against terrorism .
we have seen nothing like that from the commission .
i sincerely hope that the regulation will be rejected during the vote .
we would be equally useful to the flood victim in pakistan .
thus , this sector is not really affected at all .
the proposal for eu trade preference ha no specific aim .
one year will not give the space for the investment that is necessary .
indeed , international trade and humanitarian aid are not two diametrically opposed activity .
however , allow me also to bring in a humanitarian aspect .
we have been asked : why textile from pakistan ?
the answer is : because textile are a major export for them .
you can not expect them to conjure up something within a few month .
i would simply like to stress a couple of point .
secondly , we are not discussing the gsp either .
i do not think i have to name them .
we can only try to do our best to get it through .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 10 may 2011 .
in this way , we will prevent the radicalisation of opinion in pakistan .
this go against all the position recently adopted and must remain the exception .
there is no need to stress the importance of this initiative .
however , i think it need to answer a number of question publicly .
india is clearly interested at the highest political level .
we have made progress across a range of issue .
a with any negotiation , the last yard are the most difficult .
we are not pursuing sanction but cooperation in this area .
but let me reassure you on these crucial point .
nonetheless , the commission continues to push for a satisfactory outcome .
if the substance is not there , we should simply say no .
this is certainly something that we in europe can understand very well .
everyone understands the importance of developing trade between u .
i should like to emphasise a few point in particular .
i am thinking of the provision on seed , for example .
the commissioner mentioned , quite rightly , sustainable development .
i would say to you that we have to be very careful .
i would also agree with mr caspary on time limit .
i think he put a very good point forward there .
what effect will this have on the eu-india fta ?
what text is on the table with regard to intellectual property right ?
what is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture ?
these do not fit in with the idea which the european union represents .
although india ha an emerging economy , social disparity persist .
more than 800 million people live on le than usd 2 a day .
i call this 'the trader 's take on thing ' .
this way of thinking pervades the resolution that is before u .
i call that 'the preacher 's take on thing ' .
in my opinion , the resolution before u is a retrograde step .
it may contain a sustainable development clause , but it ha no teeth .
nature and the environment are the biggest loser in the current text .
i can not therefore endorse the text of the resolution .
our negotiator have to hold on to the 2009 resolution .
the second aspect relates to reciprocity of access to the public procurement market .
i wonder if you could provide u with those today ?
digital service and personal data are very important in europe a well .
the first is fairness for our producer and for our industry .
in this regard , i share the view expressed by my fellow member .
firstly , the issue of whether to include a chapter on sustainable development .
the commission can not ignore minimum social standard during these negotiation .
indian legislation protects them only at national level , not at international level .
we now move to the catch-the-eye part of the debate .
however , there are still many problem which need to be solved .
another question that ha been repeatedly touched upon is child labour .
obviously , there are still quite a lot of youngster working in agriculture .
that is what this is about , nothing else .
i really want to be very clear on that .
the only question is whether zero can be achieved in certain sector .
we always emphasise the need to achieve it in every sector .
i think that i have covered most of the other issue .
mr obermayr , you were asking for the floor earlier .
ok , but we do not have much time .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
the indian economy is one of the fastest growing economy in the world .
the agreement will intensify world trade , especially in the field of service .
we are entering a crucial stage in the eu-india free trade agreement negotiation .
i think this is mostly due to the non-tariff barrier .
these include tariff , non-tariff measure , investment and procurement .
last week , i met foreign minister matsumoto precisely to discus this matter .
secondly , we wish to raise the issue of non-tariff barrier .
we hope that the commission will take these comment of ours on board .
i would also welcome further cooperation on matter relating to cyber security .
they are predicting the answer before identifying the effect of implementing the solution .
however , bilateral safeguard clause are also important in this agreement .
my third question is : what are the consequence ?
these are issue that i do not believe have been entirely clarified .
surely these question should have been better assessed and researched in advance .
i would welcome such a procedure for all future trade agreement .
a you have heard , my group is not so sure .
however , there are some fundamental question that are inescapable .
first , the relationship between bilateral and multilateral agreement .
the real problem is with respect to non-tariff barrier .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
madam president , this ha been a complicated issue to deal with .
investment policy can not fail to take it into account , either .
that is not the right way to create legal certainty .
this is a balance that i hope we will be able to achieve .
we recognise that parliament and the eu have been given new competence .
therefore , it must also have access to the document .
now we have more than 300 case and ongoing procedure .
this must , therefore , be opened up to better scrutiny .
i truly hope that that will be the case .
i therefore hope that amendment 13 will receive support .
without it , we will have absolutely no democratic control over these procedure .
we need this if we are to retain and defend legal certainty .
then we will have an investment policy for the future .
we will be vigilant on the basic principle of our proposal .
our member state have investment treaty with more than 100 country .
replacing those will be a very gradual exercise , taking year .
such a mechanism should respect the procedure and prerogative of the institution involved .
we are ready actively to support them in that endeavour .
now the green are talented politician - and i say this in admiration .
that is why there are two thing that i regard a being important .
firstly , the over one thousand agreement already in existence must be retained .
once again , i would like to thank all those involved .
the dutch business community is amongst the largest investor worldwide .
let u wait and see how the vote go tomorrow .
outside trade and investment are essential for economic recovery .
at the same time , we can not over-protect them like molly-coddled infant .
that would certainly not be a practice that would result in legal certainty .
it is important for article 5 and 6 to be retained .
i completely agree with mr caspary that our negotiation should be conducted quickly .
for my part , i admire your rhetorical skill .
with their help , perhaps we could get even more green policy through .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 may 2011 .
the eu is both a recipient and provider of foreign direct investment .
the next item is the one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
however , this is only one of the condition of stability of europe .
the democratic regression recently seen in several member state is a disturbing phenomenon .
his 37-year old son had died the previous year of cancer .
no parent should have to go through the pain of losing a child .
a a mother , i can think of nothing worse .
the only solution is fundamental dialogue with and direct recourse to the public .
they face the biggest attack since the end of the second world war ...
he is potentially a dangerous risk to the public .
i cherish the hope that the imf doe not want to replace al-qaeda .
let u not think that nothing can be done about these tragedy .
i will give three example in the 20 second i have left .
how many time is a greek mep going to meet his slovak voter ?
besides , only large member state will benefit from a pan-european list .
this is at odds with the spirit of a democratic europe .
the people of scotland deserve a clear answer to a clear question .
i am saying this , therefore , to thank all those people .
paradoxically , the new rule are also destabilising for employer .
the european parliament declared 2010 the year for combating poverty .
the slovak government will fuel unemployment and increase poverty with this labour code .
our parliament ha often emphasised the fundamental nature of the right to food .
our institution made 2010 the european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
this principle is confirmed by council regulation ( ec ) no 2371/2002 .
neither of these can be efficient if we ignore the other .
it is not yet too late to make change .
celebrating this year is a good time to take that on board .
climate change research must be encouraged , especially a part of multinational project .
i also welcome the initiative aimed at organising employee training programme .
madam president , it is a pleasure to be here this afternoon .
it also reviewed current forest information system in europe .
the report will help u to focus this work .
a further phase need to be developed once the information need are clear .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
there can be no talk of maintenance or sustainable forestry management .
the report accurately show that forestry policy is the responsibility of member state .
support must be maintained for creating forest plantation a part of these programme .
- the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
nonetheless , the overall responsibility for this process lie with the commission .
i would therefore like to address you quite directly , commissioner šemeta .
i would like to make that clear at the outset .
however , the discussion that we had were very intense , commissioner šemeta .
i hope that he will continue the work with the same impetus .
the second key requirement is that the commissioner must also accept greater responsibility .
you have listed clear criterion for when you will do that .
thank you also for the guideline that will help the member state .
we are a legislative body ; we draft a budget .
we know that there is a continual threat of terrorism throughout the world .
they should serve a a basis for essentially improving security .
that is why we need to raise the matter and talk about it .
lady and gentleman , i would like to highlight two report .
we followed a similar procedure last year and the year before .
therefore i congratulate those involved in the work of the hungarian presidency .
these are the problem which should be overcome at last .
secondly , quantity is one thing , quality is another .
thirdly , allow me to comment on financial management .
i think that we need to take that on board .
commissioner , i hope that you will take this up with your colleague .
my fifth and last comment concern the investment facility .
there is a lot we can learn from that .
i would like to thank them all for that .
in general , emea is considered a well organised and functioning agency .
i am very satisfied with the readiness of the court to do so .
the next speaker is minister zsolt lászló becsey on behalf of the council .
minister , thank you very much for coming here this morning .
i therefore invite parliament to begin discussion on this issue .
we are ready to share our idea with you .
more generally we share your concern that the eu budget be correctly implemented .
the 2009 discharge procedure is now reaching it end .
you have heard the court of auditor and examined it report .
i would like to focus on three topic of special interest .
they are the closest to the project which we are discussing .
having said that , what need to happen before ex-ante control are improved ?
how can we ensure improvement of the management of implementing organisation ?
there are people with enough dream and skill in poor country .
it ha two instrument , two mandate in fact , for doing so .
it is therefore a policy coherence matter that we are talking about here .
moreover , the commission ha a heavy responsibility in this matter .
we will have to ensure that this acquis is preserved .
this rate decreased from 54 % in 2007 to 36 % .
we think that more effort must be made in this field .
i think that is going too far , to put it politely .
i can only ask parliament and plenary to improve matter in this respect .
in this area only 73 % of the fund have been committed .
it wa said to be a measure to promote tourism .
lady and gentleman , we still have a lot to do here .
this should not be left to each individual country .
even so , it is essential to continue making progress with it .
this is also where we have the biggest problem .
the report contains three requirement that i would like to emphasise in particular .
it is not possible to continue mismanaging fund without it being noticed .
this is another area in which the commission must make improvement .
i will try to carry on your work well during the next year .
thirdly , we are talking about money from taxpayer , european citizen .
this is money which european citizen give the european union .
why then do we not have the same at european level ?
it is therefore very difficult to summarise this issue in one speech .
on the contrary , we should support the report which propose postponing discharge .
i very much appreciate my fellow member mr chatzimarkakis 's approach .
i agree to a large extent with what mr gerbrandy ha said .
for me , that is a vitally important demand .
i have to offer explicit thanks to mr welle .
i wa the discharge rapporteur for the last exercise .
there wa some tension between me and the secretariat-general .
however , let me add a side comment on that point .
we want an open debate about the council 's budget .
finally , i would just like to comment on the european medicine agency .
some people have questioned whether we are not being overly critical .
i am obviously pleased that the hungarian presidency ha chosen to be here .
today we are debating the eu 's account for 2009 .
this should ring alarm bell ahead of the vote .
there can be no doubt that reform is needed here .
what remains in practice are other political lever that we can use .
it is unfortunate that the council ha not adhered to these arrangement .
the difference wa eur 112 billion over a seven-year period .
parliament agreed to revise their figure to eur 110 billion .
declaration of assurance from member state and political responsibility cost nothing .
that is a good omen for the upcoming negotiation .
finally , i would like to touch on a general matter .
it is time we had a positive da for a change .
a significant portion of it is being inappropriately spent .
those are the conclusion of the court of auditor .
the same is true of the european parliament 's budget .
in the netherlands , we would say : you are a white tornado .
a great many member have taken part in the debate .
this is linked to the complexity of these rule .
much ha also been spoken of increasing the risk of error .
i have been working to achieve this for some time .
consequently , your offer is not really an offer .
it is an offer to make u small and weak .
how would the national parliament react to such a suggestion ?
these are paragraph 77 and 81 in the report by mr chatzimarkakis .
the criticism of the regulation is justified , however .
the regulation are still living in the 1950s and have never been modernised .
in my opinion , overtime should definitely be included in this salary .
what we are talking about here is creating new job vacancy .
we should also seek to obtain a true overview of the administrative cost .
the current 6.7 % of the budget is far too low an estimate .
i still have a number of concern , however .
firstly , the procedure for recovering misspent fund is too slow .
on the commission 's discharge , i support the granting of a discharge .
we therefore need to ensure that structural fund are not discredited or undermined .
on the council discharge , i would support postponement .
the issue of parliament 's expenditure also interest me .
it give a very poor impression of our institution .
control can not mean bureaucracy , since this is always an unnecessary cost .
the principle of trust in the institution should prevail .
strasbourg is a symbol of european unity that must not be abandoned .
i would therefore like to address you directly , mr becsey .
after all , that could only result in this right being restricted .
it work the same way in all democratic state .
in the recommendation submitted we separated the budgetary process and the discharge process .
it is not helpful to continue with these problem .
i think this will promote presentation between the various administration .
please would you pas this message on to them once again .
i consider it only right that you are here .
i do not think there is particular cause to mention it .
nonetheless , it is good that you are here .
our work would not be possible without your background work .
my sincere thanks to my fellow member and to everyone involved .
what happens , then , when the people do not understand ?
finland doe not now intend to endorse the portuguese package .
that is why we need to sort out the smaller one .
one of mr rivellni 's proposal concern the discharge of the european council .
in that respect , we have one more lesson to learn .
the internal problem of every institution make people forget about improving interinstitutional cooperation .
we therefore need to subscribe to such study in selected area this year .

transitional arrangement for bilateral investment agreement between member state and third country (
it is clear that we are not going to see the money again .
it is also clear that we are breaking the law .
let me finish by quoting my countryman rudyard kipling .
'you will find it better policy to say : --
for the end of that game is oppression and shame ,
and the nation that play it is lost ! '
the eu should take much better care of taxpayer ' money .
it is time we put our house in order .
over and above myself , i feel ashamed for our institution .
you are incapable of defending the right of one of your member .
this is the result of the european union 's wretched trade policy .
it seems that aid is granted partly in order avoid dangerous anti-democratic tendency .
did the pakistani authority really not know about this ?
the country place a strong emphasis on following pro-euro-atlantic policy .
i therefore support and welcome the rapporteur 's conclusion .
the critical issue are adequately highlighted , a are the positive element .
the agency are useful above all ... to the agency .
it argues , overall , for a more constructive and transparent process .
some agency have also shown a number of weakness in procurement procedure .
i urge , in this respect , the agency to :
improve the transparency of estimate and responsibility of project ;
strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level ;
yet the management board sometimes delegate sole administrative responsibility to the executive director .
a significant amount of the college 's total budget contains irregularity .
in writing . - i voted to give discharge to the translation centre .
the agency is self-financing from payment made by the institutions/bodies for service provided .
in 2010 the agency adopted it multiannual work programme for 2011-2015 .
the agency should also redress it weakness in recruitment planning .
furthermore , the agency ha not yet drawn up a multiannual work programme .
for these reason parliament ha today voted to grant budgetary discharge for 2009 .
in writing . - ( de ) i abstained from voting .
these are serious failing which urgently need to be corrected .
it should be taken into account that parliament granted it discharge in may .
the annual account for 2009 were found to be regular .
however , the assessment of it activity ha been positive .
i welcome the work carried out by the european maritime safety agency .
i believe that the current deficiency must be redressed .
i believe that such problem ought to be avoided in future year .
this would help avoid the considerable number of budgetary transfer .
in writing . - ( de ) discharge ha been granted .
the budget wa reduced by 0.5 % compared with 2008 .
i congratulate the agency on it considerable progress in this respect .
in writing . - ( de ) discharge ha been granted .
this situation ha persisted since the creation of the agency in 2008 .
i think there would be advantage in those concern being dispelled .
effective human resource management appears to be eurojust 's main problem .
i consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agency .
i consider that these initiative improve the authorising officer 's guidance and control .
this circumstance must be remedied immediately before any further discharge can be granted .
in writing . - ( de ) i abstained from voting .
the annual account for 2009 have been declared reliable on all essential point .
this repeated failure to address these deficiency and successfully remedy them is unacceptable .
the introduction of these system need to be completed .
how can a company operate properly without these basic need being guaranteed ?
a with the artemis joint undertaking , it is only just starting out .
i am aware that the joint undertaking is still in a start-up period .
i recognise that the joint undertaking is still in a start-up period .
i therefore urge the joint undertaking to rapidly remedy this grave deficiency .
the introduction of these system need to be completed .
the introduction of these system need to be completed .
it will need to do so a soon a possible .
case where internal control do not operate correctly must be eliminated .
you know how committed i am to democratic value ...
mr gollnisch publicly took a stand in support of an outrageous press release .
it talk about 'invasion and destruction of our cultural value by islam ' .
mr gollnisch will be able to present his defence .
i am therefore voting against his request to protect his parliamentary immunity .
thus we have decided not to defend the immunity .
this is why i voted against the withdrawal of his immunity .
the comment were about the intolerance of islamist regime towards unbeliever .
it is unworthy of you to adopt this report .
mr gollnisch publicly took a stand in support of an outrageous press release .
it talk about 'invasion and destruction of our cultural value by islam ' .
mr gollnisch will be able to present his defence .
i am therefore voting against his request to protect his parliamentary immunity .
therefore , we vote in favour of this report .
therefore , we vote in favour of this report .
that it why i will vote in favour of the recommendation .
for the above reason , i voted to adopt this agreement .
it is more cost-effective in term of organisation and implementation .
therefore , we voted in favour of this report .
therefore , we voted in favour of this report .
however , the actual right to have judgment enforced is still lacking .
that is why i voted in favour of mr mccarthy 's report .
the level of success in recovering unpaid debt is remarkably low .
both instrument should be free-standing remedy additional to those available under national law .
late payment and unpaid debt harm business and consumer alike .
the time ha come to simplify and speed up the recovery procedure .
however , obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process .
however , obtaining a judgment is only one part of the process .
this report raise the problem of the bank ' debt reimbursement guarantee .
bank benefit from preferential interest rate in order to guarantee their profit .
however , obtaining a judgment is often only one part of the process .
they help improve shared management , and that also mean structural fund .
more effective management and control system must be established .
we can not tolerate any scandal or mismanagement of expenditure .
therefore , the discharge process is not the right forum for these issue .
granting discharge to a deficient system doe nothing to help this situation .
control must be ensured before fund are handed out .
several of the comment on increasing transparency are along the right line .
added to this , the sum in question are basically symbolic .
other demand include rule restricting long distance journey by official parliament car .
i therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .
paragraph 119 is more comprehensive and more practical for implementation purpose .
we therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .
apart from this paragraph , the report contains a number of sensible initiative .
the eu 's institution are a major tourist attraction in brussels .
i am in favour of cutting cost related to the european parliament .
the report did , however , show that some progress is being made .
i am therefore in favour of postponing the 2009 discharge .
however , in this instance the council 's cooperation wa completely inadequate .
in writing . - in favour of the following : 1 .
i expect the court of auditor to demonstrate the progress in this direction .
everyone is aware that this institution 's 2009 budget wa investigated by olaf .
the cor must follow up this issue in it annual activity report .
the commission must strengthen monitoring and annual reporting on compliance .
a the rapporteur say , full knowledge of appropriate expenditure is also necessary .
we must therefore be seen to be extremely vigilant .
this is why we refused to give our blanket approval .
i voted in favour of this report for three main reason .
because of these error , best value for money wa not ensured .
a hearing with emea ha been scheduled to this effect for mid-july .
the agency must take measure to implement the recommendation .
the agency must take all necessary step to improve the situation .
the introduction of these system need to be completed immediately .
the joint undertaking 's utilisation rate for payment appropriation wa 65.3 % .
in term of humanitarian aid , the european union always lead the way .
these preference may even give rise to a dangerous precedent .
there are also , however , more equitable form of aid .
all this against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis and high unemployment .
last year , there were severe flood in pakistan .
this alone would have been sufficient ground for voting against this report .
only then should parliament become active and make a decision .
this is an inequitable proposal and i am voting against this report .
unfortunately , none of the green amendment wa adopted in inta .
the text ha finally been referred back to the committee .
we still are , but a once-simple idea ha become over-complicated and unworkable .
for me , a major stumbling block ha been the wto .
meanwhile , country like lithuania are struggling to make end meet .
the eu should be careful not to send out the wrong message .
therefore , we must avoid legal loophole and ensure a considered transition .
certain developing country have had to learn that the hard way .
for these reason i decided to vote in favour of the report .
we also lost our amendment concerning better transparency rule .
i adopt it position at first reading , taking over the commission proposal .
only three european union member state are ranked above georgia in this index .
i voted in favour of granting additional aid to georgia .
restriction have been placed on the formality necessary to start up in business .
today georgia is regarded a a country with a dynamically developing economy .
the european union ha found itself a new mission .
there is therefore no longer any need to implement the imf austerity plan .
the greens/efa group ha , in the end , voted in favour .
i understand that your comment is intended for the minute .
migration flow and asylum and their impact on schengen ( debate )
europe must welcome the latter if she want to be true to herself .
that would be completely impossible without the european union .
this mean that burden have to be shared equitably .
it also mean that all member state need to take their responsibility seriously .
solidarity and responsibility are the key word in our response .
this is about common governance , not unilateral move .
i emphasise once again that this is part of an overall approach .
they will , in fact , be encouraged to act alone .
it is not about abandoning citizen ' right of free movement .
it is about valuing their integrity by strengthening the rule .
i am confident that this house will support our approach and our effort .
this is not what we are going to do .
citizen notice it on a daily basis when travelling around europe .
we will defend this principle in the european parliament .
secondly , i should like to make it clear that we practise solidarity .
i must therefore also ask the commission to look more into this .
we are talking here about minimum standard in the european union .
i am therefore calling on the commission to take action here , too .
my second point concern strengthening frontex , a ha already been mentioned .
they have done the work ; they have made effort .
i am very sorry , but i do not think it is .
i think it is over the top and misguided .
we are not dealing here with a crisis in the european union .
nobody ha got worked up over figure of such magnitude .
i do not know whether you are familiar with it .
that is what article 78 ( 3 ) of the current treaty say .
the french president then naturally asks whether they have a screw loose .
all the tunisian coming to italy now want to go to france ?
in that case , we will close the border .
that is what i would have expected of you .
i would therefore have liked to see you fight it .
moreover , what occurred wa absolutely out of proportion .
and so we come to the problem : the communication from the commission .
in my opinion , it wa not very clear .
germany took in several hundred of thousand of people .
all this talk of a sinking ship is just propaganda .
added to this , we are now hearing talk of criminal and mafia .
a if criminal and mafia were landing in lampedusa !
we do not see them , but they are here in our country .
the problem is quite straightforward : people are fleeing from north africa .
so let u share out the support for them in europe .
england wa like this : it turned jew away .
white are allowed in , brown-skinned people are not !
that is the kind of europe we want to fight against .
that can not be what my job is about .
in relation to schengen , i want to say one thing .
this is not a case of completely killing off the idea .
it is a case of sticking to the idea and applying it universally .
we can not complain of a lack of fund in this area .
you attack those who want to control their own border policy .
member state should stop rewarding illegal foreigner with residence permit .
france felt under pressure and it re-erected national border .
this clearly need to change because it is no longer tenable .
we need therefore to link schengen with solidarity ; schengen need solidarity .
mr president , the speaker talked of strengthening schengen .
mr president , i thank the member for his question .
once you fulfil those condition , then you can join schengen .
( fr ) mr president , this debate beggar belief .
when will europe stop saying one thing and doing another ?
is it not time that it opened it eye ?
that is why a single , common european policy will not work .
we still have boatload of fortune-seeking migrant reaching lampedusa .
instead , she give u some claptrap about solidarity .
what is the commission going to do about this ?
i also agree that proper control of external border is essential .
therefore , we require a real mechanism for evaluating schengen .
they should not even have been permitted to apply for a visa .
so please do not make the message ambiguous in the statement .
you are blocking much of the work we are doing here in parliament .
and finally , the commission is looking ahead to a migration policy .
it should highlight the failure of member state to implement eu migration rule .
it is a citizen ' right that you can not simply relativise .
do you want to know what honestly annoys me ?
we need to show these people a bit of respect .
however , this trust is based on reciprocal obligation .
this acquis is not static , but must instead be developed .
member state must demonstrate solidarity in managing the schengen area .
madam president , we must continue to take this into account .
the problem is that this communication only go halfway .
the answer , however , is greater involvement of eu mechanism .
i am pointing that out because european citizen have many question about schengen .
this is about dealing with an emergency situation like the one before u .
what we do not need , then , is a debate on schengen .
restoring internal border control is not solidarity , it is punishment .
this challenge today is the surge of migration and refugee .
italy itself can certainly assume responsibility for this and must do so .
why is there nothing more explicit here on burden-sharing ?
why is the commission not coming up with a concrete proposal on this ?
the eu must develop frontex into a genuine border protection agency .
let u refrain from creating unnecessary obstacle between u .
i would like to draw your attention to another problem .
it is a fear of people from romania and bulgaria .
madam president , freedom of movement is a cornerstone of european integration .
let u not open a pandora 's box by revising schengen .
it should be temporary , exceptional and a last resort .
short-term procedure that hinder resettlement have to be removed .
more than one million european citizen work in country other than their own .
one hundred and fifty thousand people cross the border every day into luxembourg .
do you want to subject them to border check ?
ten of million of european will travel this summer .
do mr berlusconi and mr sarkozy want to subject them to border check ?
do you want to subject them to border check ?
re-read the treaty , re-read article 67 and 78 .
mr jørgensen and party leader mr thorning-schmidt both argued for this .
there wa talk earlier about a ping-pong game going on .
we can not produce a communication like this in two day .
is that a reason to reinstall internal border control ?
we have about 25 000 tunisian coming to europe .
we have discussed this on many occasion here in the plenary .
however , there are refugee coming , and increasingly more so now .
these people are clearly a reason for european action and solidarity .
i want to protect this and further promote it .
i am happy that i can count on your support in this .
we need a european mechanism with the involvement of the european parliament .
the shortcoming should never automatically lead to the reintroduction of border control .
we are also working together with you on strengthening frontex .
i am convinced that the current rule can cater for most situation .
this can be done by issuing guideline or recommendation .
we need to strengthen our rule , not to undermine them .
let me continue in my mother tongue for some horizontal general concluding remark .
the proposal of the commission wa published six day ago .
the hungarian presidency will withstand every effort to the contrary .
i repeat once again that this is our starting point .
at the same time we also have to combat illegal migration .
the two country fulfil the technical criterion of schengen .
we would like to improve the situation of family in the european union .
there is no reason whatsoever why we should now question this .
meps are elected by the people , a the voice of the people .
yet when they reflect national interest here , it 's labelled 'populist ' .
name calling , scaremongering and creeping bureaucracy is calculated and megalomaniac .
from this perspective , the commission proposal for managed immigration flow seems incomprehensible .
we must also bear in mind the challenge facing europe .
migrant often contribute to the economic growth of their country of destination .
how should we classify the middle-class protest in the arab country ?
for this we do not need the return of national border control .
if anything , it risk increasing illegality , insecurity and economic cost .
what we need are solid european solution to a european problem .
these problem will have dramatic consequence , which are easy to predict .
the right tool for the job is criminal law .
so we shall no longer call them lobbyist but stakeholder .
of course , interest can be conflicting , and rightly so .
i especially welcome the report by mr carlo casini .
accordingly , the council may be able to conquer it internal resistance .
the first is that the register is not really mandatory .
this need to be stated openly at this point .
madam president , i think this would be an experiment .
i think it would encourage intelligent and informed lobbying in parliament .
the more transparency and the more openness there is the better .
it is disappointing that the council ha not signed up .
the group of the greens/european free alliance have long campaigned for this .
we want the financial detail made available to be more precise and meaningful .
we also favour regular check by a common secretariat .
i would like to thank all those involved for what ha been achieved .
we do not believe that we have already achieved it .
madam president , so we are to have a transparency register !
the register will change little ; the lobbyist will always get through .
a voluntary system of registration wa introduced ; it wa quite ineffectual .
i do not want any british meps to be here anyway .
our citizen have a right to expect genuine transparency here , too .
this register is a step toward transparency , but just a step .
after all , people also contact u using many other different communication channel .
that would create true transparency , greater credibility and ultimately greater trust .
we are the only body directly elected by them .
i hope that the other institution will follow suit .
i can not say much about what we are discussing in detail .
it is good that we have now finally agreed on a lobbyist register .
many of u have been fighting for this for a long time .
however , it is still a very cautious proposal .
the comment from the council and from commissioner šefčovič today are very positive .
while this is a serious matter , these are recent development .
they are isolated case , and a good job too .
this register is therefore a step in the right direction .
that is why our group will vote unreservedly in favour of this text .
these cost should be documented in a transparent manner .
we should give serious consideration to other step and solution .
any other activity on various board will always provoke question and doubt .
here i am also referring to member state capital .
transparency ha always been a very important issue for the council .
so this doe not mean that we would accede to the interinstitutional agreement .
the text ha , however , remained the unchanged .
those who want to lobby must enrol themselves in the register .
we grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendation .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
i have actually already addressed this in my report on toy safety .
clear arrangement to make this principle generally applicable will enhance transparency .
nuclear safety 25 year after the chernobyl disaster ( debate )
the size of the task meant that a united effort wa required .
another of the commission 's responsibility is the combating of environmental contamination .
i agree that we should never forget the chernobyl disaster .
i would encourage you to stick to your principle .
there is still a great deal to be done in chernobyl .
i would encourage the commission to put such study in motion .
in the final analysis , the safest option is the nuclear exit strategy .
this is precisely what is needed 25 year after chernobyl .
( de ) mr president , i would like to thank mr leinen .
we should also address the issue of nuclear waste .
it is also becoming a european challenge for the future of nuclear energy .
whatever decision we take now , reversibility and retrievability are therefore required .
i would welcome a clear position from the commission on this matter .
there are also useful conclusion that can be drawn from chernobyl .
they are being constructed without any regard for eu safety standard .
the large new shelter is currently the subject of much debate .
the whole of europe learnt that lesson well 25 year ago .
the issue of nuclear safety must be fundamentally reviewed .
we have also become more aware of this following recent event in fukushima .
chernobyl remains the worst civil nuclear disaster in history .
firstly , we must guarantee maximum level of safety and security to citizen .
all commercialisation of low-cost nuclear power plant must also be stopped .
i welcome this important discussion with the european commission .
appropriate safeguarding of the explosion site is still an unresolved issue .
the test should be mandatory and carried out periodically .
the soviet centralist model is largely responsible for this misinformation .
it is , in fact , a global issue .
( mr mann begin to speak without a microphone . )
... . 1986 and the nuclear meltdown of an outdated nuclear power plant .
the responsible politician need to distance themselves from over-hasty solution .
we need to take the fear of our citizen seriously .
we have discussed country neighbouring europe which have nuclear programme .
mr president , i would like to speak about one issue only .
fukushima will also be a source of anxiety for year to come .
this is leading to a rethink in energy policy .
this sort of confusion is possible precisely because there is no comprehensive research .
much ha been done , without the eu authority paying much attention .
in italy , the search for suitable site ha been suspended .
you have suggested that i should put a european regulator in place .
however , i am bound by law and legislation .
a yet we do not have a european nuclear watchdog .
the test criterion will be drawn up on thursday .
i believe that this is in the interest of the people of europe .
we must learn the lesson of complete transparency from chernobyl .
the next item is question time ( b7-0303/2011 ) .
colleague , please note that we are starting 40 minute late .
i would ask you again to raise this matter with the bureau .
subject : provision in the new draft budget for combating youth unemployment
when exactly we enter good time is a country-by-country assessment .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
commissioner , would you consider an area-based response to youth employment problem ?
country with weaker performance can learn from these experience .
i would also like to highlight the youth-specific esf programme .
at a young age , this should not be seen a an obstacle .
subject : the cap and the multiannual financial framework beyond 2013
they also need to be in a position to plan ahead .
( ro ) i sincerely thank the commissioner for the answer he gave .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
i can share to some extent both the diagnosis and the prescription .
so this type of expenditure is conducive to growth and job .
therefore we should exploit this potential of the european budget to it limit .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
in total , over 56 000 people safely made it home .
i would like to emphasise this in the strongest term .
we now have to find a way to support these community .
there wa actually a separate question on the coordinated response .
may i continue with an answer to this question ?
it will have the physical capability to operate on a 24/7 basis .
subject : canned fish product a part of food aid
we encourage them to purchase food locally a much a possible .
on that basis the exact composition of our food assistance will be determined .
thank you for your reply , commissioner , which i believe .
and when it come to cooking , the fish are already cooked .
i am thinking in particular of mackerel and herring .
we need to look at high nutritional value and also simplicity of use .
sometimes agricultural surplus from europe are used in food assistance .
i can assure you that we strive to do the right thing .
do you want to press me for a supplementary ?
the council conclusion of last december talked about various commission proposal during 2011 .
the word that made a difference were 'voluntary commitment from member state ' .
that is definitely what we intend to achieve through the next cap .
( ga ) i want to thank the commissioner .
it is clear that her policy is going in the right direction .
member of the commission . - basically i think that we agree .
subject : gender equality in the fight against climate change
so climate change and woman is very much on the agenda .
subject : cost of cutting co2 in the european union
the eu ha managed to decouple it economic growth from it emission .
china is carrying out huge pilot project on carbon trading .
they want to make it a national system in the very near future .
they are also introducing environmental tax , and so on and so forth .
( the sitting wa suspended at 20.20 and resumed at 21.00 )
textile name and related labelling of textile product ( debate )
very often , deceptive trade practice are also going on .
i hope this study will lead to clarity on this .
congratulation , once again , and thank you for your attention .
i believe that the compromise reached today is a very good result .
we fought not only to achieve origin marking but also for traceability .
we can not leave unheeded our citizen ' need for truthful product information .
we have come a long way since the commission tabled it original proposal .
i do think that we have achieved a great deal , however .
i think we have achieved a very good result .
this agreement ha a large number of positive point .
this measure will also benefit consumer a innovation is encouraged .
the discussion about the labelling have lasted longer than the commission initially proposed .
however , i think that this can only benefit european consumer .
this report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal .
we are therefore relying on his stated commitment to bring it forward .
we must therefore be much more ambitious and seek the harmonisation of size .
labelling is good for consumer , a we all know .
in this regard , i have a problem with origin labelling .
( da ) mr president , the textile industry is a global industry .
this report is comprehensive , thorough and very technical .
this compromise is a step in the right direction .
the european conservative and reformist will vote in favour of the proposal .
a single system of regulation is of course beneficial in both case .
forgoing origin marking is , sadly , only the latest terrible idea .
i am satisfied with the agreement reached between the co-legislators .
in practice this option is already open to operator .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may at 12:30 .
therefore , we support the majority of the position adopted here .
stress test of the eu banking sector ( debate )
we need to ensure that the same thing doe not happen this year .
indeed we need a whole lot more banking transparency in general .
there really is no excuse not to stress-test the banking book .
but there is no overall plan to address under-capitalisation .
so please can we have proper disclosed coordination of the response ?
we also need better capitalisation , and we will come back to that .
the dissemination of these will therefore be much more detailed than last year .
this is indeed essential for the credibility of the exercise .
we ought to avoid the same error of conception and implementation .
the field of investigation must be consistent and similar .
there will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct .
this being so , the test must quite clearly be realistic .
this year , we are in a different situation .
i just wanted to bring that small point to your attention .
behind closed door the argument ha focused on the numerator .
but we should also be concerned about the denominator .
the financial crisis should have taught u all to value transparency .
european stress test have been carried out over the last two year .
we believed that we would finally find out the truth .
however this is just an audacious way of pre-empting a political decision .
only thus will we regain the confidence of the financial expert .
( sv ) mr president , we are living in difficult time .
the example of ireland demonstrates the opposite , unfortunately .
just a mr barnier said , it is all about confidence .
we will discus this point again tomorrow , however .
we have made something clear today : credibility engenders trust .
yet the banking book will not be included in the stress test .
this transparency is demanded by both financial market and citizen .
a common european strategy for this would be very valuable .
they can also produce counterproductive reaction in the market and cause disruption .
mr president , bank were once revered in ireland .
firstly , do all bank have to be stress-tested ?
how can this idyllic situation be brought about a soon a possible ?
we have damaged confidence in the european union and in the eurozone .
the national authority must apply the action plan already .
this would therefore resolve the problem from stress test in general .
we should not expect to see bank failing the test .
mr zemke asked a rather broad question about future threat and risk .
we are going to work on this point , therefore .
our discussion have gone on a little too long .
the irish example ha shown that this check wa fundamentally unreliable .
yet that is what the eu is doing every day .
the weee directive state that exported electronic item must be in working order .
however , this relies on effective eu-wide inspection policy which are clearly missing .
frankly , a a european , i am ashamed .
this is an urgent problem and action need to be taken now .
there is actually nothing new about this , of course .
that would provide better mean of control in general .
in other speech , commissioner potočnik also referred to a new agency .
what step doe the commission intend to pursue in this area ?
the volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the eu .
the legal loophole that permit these hazardous export must be closed .
the entry of waste into the eu must also be better controlled .
we also need binding rule to combat this problem .
thirdly , waste production ha increased or stabilised in recent year .
a many here have already said , we are right to be outraged .
i will listen carefully to the commission 's response about new legislation .
this should greatly reduce the considerable number of illegal shipment .
give mr potočnik the few week he need to draft this legislation .
lady and gentleman , i would like to apologise for the delay .
before we begin , i would like to say a few word .
the european union must have greater political strength and not just economic strength .
our own path to 20th century liberal democracy wa a very slow one .
i can make hundred of statement - and i do .
only then can your claim of support for peaceful protest be substantiated .
then there is our direct engagement in camp ashraf .
i have been adamant that we need a strong united eu response .
we need to get faster and smarter in how we do this .
some thing are extremely important to support these country into the future .
so too with member state : the opportunity to travel , to study .
nowhere will this policy matter more perhaps than in tunisia .
there will be many challenge for egypt in the coming month and year .
honourable member know well that stability in the middle east requires peace .
the quest for a negotiated agreement ha dominated the region for decade .
we have brought new vigour to the quartet in recent month .
the situation there frankly , especially for the child , is awful .
we have put forward proposal to israel to support that greater access .
change doe not necessarily ensure progress , but progress absolutely requires change .
that mean we have to be more determined to act .
indeed , it is the only thing that ever ha ' .
what is europe 's role in all of this ?
are we willingly and actively involved in the situation ?
europe backed stability and development aid in the mediterranean .
we now need to move on and take action .
a solution to the conflict in the middle east ?
tackling all of the above at the same time is no easy task .
the united state , emerging country , or others ?
we have made saving of eur 4 billion in the european budget .
we only need to look at the mission in libya .
that is not the sort of credibility which europe need .
you have mentioned the three m : money , mobility and market access .
do you know how much money wa transferred under the u marshall plan ?
for year in a row ? 1 % of gdp every year .
and what are we talking about and promising egypt ?
people massacred by tank and by sniper every day .
that is the clear analysis we can make today .
ok then , make that very clear here today in the debate .
i want you to declare that you give assad a few day .
the ecr , my group , nevertheless remains constructively engaged with the eeas .
it is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interest .
what are we doing for the people of gaza or darfur ?
the revolution in the arab country have one important demand in common .
it is quite obvious that strength only lie in unity .
this doe not only depend on you , clearly .
mr schulz ha referred to these flagrant dysfunction in his speech .
i do not lack any ambition for what europe can be .
all of these thing require u to shift and make change .
how do we get to the point where gaddafi ha to go ?
it is absolutely critical and it requires u to have a united front .
mr schulz said that there is a long way to go .
it is not the plan we talk about for obvious reason .
i agree with you about the support and the issue of debt .
what we have got is again a journey on sanction .
the institution of europe are all focused in the same direction .
i have to find the resource for opening an office in benghazi .
i am also keen to improve the dialogue that we have .
mr gualtieri , you and i had a good discussion yesterday .
the european union ha sole responsibility for external trade policy .
it is the only player and the only representative of the member state .
it is not constantly being denounced on the basis of national vanity .
firstly , the question of the operation of european union mission .
we are hoping for specific action in this area .
finally , i would like to mention eu-nato relation .
so what is our current policy on syria and the middle east ?
this need to be explained to u better , baroness ashton .
can you really see syria chairing the un human right council ?
have you campaigned against syria chairing the un human right council ?
have you pushed for an international inquiry into the massacre ?
a we know , the situation is certainly very complicated .
however , i think we need to grasp this opportunity .
both party have made incredible concession to form this government .
make use of the community instrument , in particular , to promote democracy .
we need a solution that is unbureaucratic , fast , simple and political .
if you can bring this about , you will have our full support .
the schengen area is a great achievement and we should protect it .
on syria , for example , what are you convinced of ?
obviously , you can not sell new weapon without destroying the old one .
that will be a moment of glory for the european union .
a word about a neighbouring country in the middle east : turkey .
this is not what is meant by credibility , in my opinion .
we welcomed the coming of democracy when the revolt and uprising began .
there is also no protective power which could bring him down .
the lisbon treaty ha created the framework and necessary instrument for such action .
the report show where the effort should be intensified .
the same applies to the international financial institution and multilateral security organisation .
it will take time and consistent and coordinated action on our side .
this sunday , there were local election in albania .
how good can we be in our home field ?
turkey also play a major role in this respect .
we should not simply regard turkey from the perspective of an accession candidate .
this doe not necessarily have anything to do with the question of accession .
secondly , partnership with russia is a very important factor .
this is something which we are sometimes lacking in .
while russia ha too much , we have too little .
our objective must definitely be to establish a genuine and active partnership .
we want them to move towards democracy and to respect human right .
however , we are not really becoming sufficiently involved .
currently , there are military operation being conducted by nato in libya .
she talk about a common eu policy on foreign affair , etc .
but doe she share my dismay at the hypocrisy of the european union ?
doe that imply acceptance that the death penalty is a punishment ?
however , that is not meant to be a criticism of her .
what she is saying that mr barroso stated wa not hypocrisy .
the unity between hamas and fatah really is an historical step forward .
yes to solidarity , but yes also to the maintenance of social structure .
there is not one common policy , is there ?
you said that repeatedly to the house of lord .
there are rare occasion when one need to speak up immediately .
we must also incorporate them into our regional policy concept .
this applies , in particular , to the horn of africa .
secondly , we need to make progress in pooling and sharing military capacity .
the european defence agency ha idea on this subject .
thirdly , we need a public discussion about a new european security strategy .
however , the world ha moved on and we need a public debate .
thus , chaos rule everywhere , and everyone is confused .
once it ha been established , it should work and be effective .
it is our job and also your job to achieve this .
earlier , you agreed with mr gualtieri about pooling and sharing .
however , we need a three-pronged approach involving leading , pooling and sharing .
those are the three thing that we should have .
there are sign that this will be the case .
member state have a right to their own foreign policy .
another bloody attack could take place at any moment .
the intergovernmental nato is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation .
have you had time to think about it over the last two year ?
baroness ashton , 17 may is europe-iraq day in baghdad .
the eu presence in iraq consists of two official and one ambassador .
you would rightly like to find the resource to resolve the situation .
however , only christian are dying and only church are burning in egypt .
you need to be seen in baghdad , and indeed in kurdistan .
appointing a head would put a stop to that .
( pl ) mr president , europe is today facing two problem .
the first is the need for a new vision of the neighbourhood policy .
lady ashton say there are storm in the neighbourhood .
that is the word she used . where is our meteorological road map ?
time is a key factor in this policy and a scarce resource .
in our neighbourhood policy , we are always lagging behind event .
we want a high representative to lead , not to follow .
strengthening europe 's role at the united nation is a good thing .
it doe lead me to a number of question , however .
what is our and your message to the general assembly ?
do more in syria and do not lend your support to half-baked solution .
we had high hope following the treaty of lisbon .
i believe that some government would find it difficult to explain their action .
mr bütikofer listed four priority for the next year which i largely support .
we are dealing with separate issue , which deserve independent and in-depth discussion .
sixty european aircraft are operating over libya - 60 deaf and blind aircraft .
so let u stop moaning that we do not have a common policy .
it is the european mission that ha full legitimacy .
this issue must be put on the agenda again .
credibility mean , first of all , adherence to our value and principle .
many year ago , it put the human being centre-stage .
greater unity doe not mean that we have to lose diversity .
you ignored our warning for month and only reacted after the catastrophe .
there is a solution , a mr stevenson explained to you .
parliament ha done , is doing and will do everything in it power .
we are asking you to have the same interest in saving these life .
if not , your conscience and this chamber will hold you to account .
finally , a palestinian reconciliation is a major step ...
mr president , my comment are for baroness ashton .
the christian community in iraq ha already been more than halved .
we are now seeing the same thing happening in egypt .
i therefore have two request of you , baroness ashton .
make the copt a top priority in your policy .
a stop must be put to the systematic discrimination against them .
we must avoid europe being the repository of migrating third-worlders .
bring the population of the third world to europe ...
you are quite right that you have four minute .
mr albertini , you have four minute for your two speech .
it ha become clear from the discussion how we must act .
of course , we also need to know how to offer leadership ability .
i have found out exactly what the situation wa .
you spoke for three minute in your first speech .
i think that we are moving inexorably to a greater sense of coherence .
that is an important aspect of what we do a well .
i am not looking for a security council seat .
the vote on the three report will take place today at 12:30 .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
i can mention here the eastern partnership and black sea synergy .
mentioning this point will ensure positive progress in the negotiation between both side .
i support continuing the negotiation in the 5 + 2 format .
in writing . - europe must not fail the palestinian people yet again .
last week , a particularly significant event took place .
i ask the commission to take the lead in the proposed resettlement issue .
this can be seen in their approach to solving foreign policy problem .
these operation should not be linked to military deployment .
the common foreign and security policy must be rigorously separated from nato .
baroness ashton , the european union must be ambitious .
i hope that this proposal will appear in your white paper .
but , a evidence indicates , this is not enough .
our common foreign and security policy is at a crossroad .
the progress so far , however , ha been quite slow .
an essential part of the christian-european heritage is under threat .
people are persecuted in their hundred of thousand because of their religious belief .
it can be seen , today , that my misgiving were justified .
indication or mark identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs (
approximation of the law of the member state relating to unit of measurement (
permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicle (
driving position and the door and window of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractor (
rear-mounted roll-over protection structure of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractor (
denomination and technical specification of euro coin intended for circulation (
mr president , we have agreed a joint statement with the council .
a joint statement by the european parliament and the council .
that is all and now the minister will nod i hope .
doe the commission have something to say on this ?
the report is referred back to the committee on international trade .
amendment of the rule following the establishment of a common transparency register (
dear colleague , i have a statement to read .
( interjection from the floor : 'amen ! ' laughter )
you are going a little fast and there is a little delay .
before the vote on paragraph 33 , initial text :
mr president , it is pointless for me to quote it .
mr president , i made a mistake when reading the text .
therefore , only the expression 'former yugoslav republic of macedonia ' wa used .
mr president , i have to echo mr chichester 's earlier intervention .
if it is going to be , please tell u .
mr president , i wanted to support mr albertini .
( pl ) mr president , i have tabled an oral amendment .
the paragraph ha changed according to the amendment we have filed .
rapporteur . - mr president , the oral amendment read a follows .
the eu a a global actor : it role in multilateral organisation (
there is no particular rule one way or another .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
it ha proven to be more complicated than it looked at the start .
i know that the council is of the same opinion .
it is actually an indispensable part of the democratic process .
i would also like to contest the vote on paragraph 9 .
it is absolutely right that we should have a much transparency a possible .
it is absolutely absurd because when is a meeting a meeting ?
are they to see their name in the newspaper ?
in any case , i will never be involved in breaking this confidence .
great progress ha been made in the last few year .
first of all , i think that it should be mandatory .
the european union must emphasise the importance of social responsibility .
in a way , i think this is fantastic .
however , i would like to say that i fully support it .
i think that this is completely in line with the wto .
we are now talking about the region of japan .
the eu and japan are two of the world 's largest economy .
together , we account for a fifth of global trade .
it can be a good thing when there is a level playing field .
that is why i did not vote for the majority resolution .
forest legislation is therefore best dealt with at national level .
in a nutshell , this report stand for a militarised and imperialist europe .
this is disguised language for a further militarisation of foreign policy .
eastern european politics are especially important from poland 's point of view .
the albertini report is a step forward towards a better eu security policy .
since then , little progress ha been made in this field .
this is the reason why i voted in favour of it .
let u allow it civilian power to expand it influence everywhere .
please do not think it go unnoticed or unappreciated .
simplifying the life of european citizen is one of the eu 's concern .
a case in point is the common agricultural policy .
simplifying the life of european is one of the eu 's concern .
simplifying the life of european is one of the eu 's concern .
simplifying the life of eu citizen is one of the eu 's concern .
i supported this initiative by voting 'in favour ' .
simplifying the life of european citizen is one of the eu 's concern .
in the interest of clarity , the directive should be codified .
therefore , there is no reason for me to vote against .
simplifying the life of european is one of the eu 's concern .
simplifying the life of european is one of the eu 's concern .
unifying them and making them comprehensible can only help operator and user alike .
simplifying the life of european is one of the eu 's concern .
i voted in favour of mr karim 's report .
a a result , there will be no change to the content .
in it assessment , the council rejected all substantive amendment proposed by parliament .
these new rule would allow consumer to benefit more readily from innovative product .
however , i believe that the amendment tabled by the rapporteur are important .
the long-standing wish of producer are focused on naming and labelling .
for these reason , we voted for most of the position adopted here .
i think that european firm and consumer will benefit from clearly formulated principle .
consumer ' awareness of the good they buy is constantly growing .
a thing currently stand , the labelling requirement are highly inadequate .
we do not support parliament 's position in this regard .
stating the country of origin on the label is pointless european nitpicking .
the pvv will thus also be voting against this recommendation .
hopefully , the new legislation will simplify the current labelling rule .
european consumer have the right to know what they are buying .
i voted in favour of the report by mr manders .
moreover , their economic recovery could be seriously jeopardised .
these trade preference were granted for a period ending on 31 december 2010 .
in addition , economic development ha promoted political stability throughout the region .
moreover , it could seriously jeopardise the economic recovery .
the benefit from this regulation came to an end on 31 december 2010 .
moreover , their economic recovery could be seriously jeopardised .
these trade preference were granted for a period ending on 31 december 2010 .
they need to be notified to the world trade organisation .
it ha been blocked because of the delayed comitology decision .
an informal trialogue resolved the issue to permit adoption at first reading .
the eu is indeed the world 's largest economy .
in romania , we have one of the fastest internet speed in europe .
by enhancing european broadband , this will increase our competitiveness .
we recognise the need to plan and organise the radio spectrum .
in writing . - the european union is the world 's biggest economy .
furthermore , that is true in both rural and urban area .
this requires separately allocated radio spectrum in order to guarantee troublefree connection .
universal access to high-speed access is largely dependent on this sharing of frequency .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
we must also ensure that new technology and equipment for consumption are accessible .
i support the rapporteur and therefore voted 'in favour ' .
furthermore , it will reduce harmful cross-border interference and disturbance .
the way in which it is used today is far from optimal .
we should encourage the use of technology that allow different service to cohabit .
we also have one of the highest mobile penetration rate .
there is no doubt that these are positive change .
but what about the million european who live at risk of poverty ?
this is too high a figure for our nation .
this information should be accessible to the general public .
measure helping to increase this transparency are therefore welcome and necessary .
we will see how it is implemented in the future .
the current legislation allows lobbyist to report much le than is actually incurred .
it is just a important that the council join this initiative .
all parliamentarian take responsibility politically for their decision and standpoint .
i support the report of carlo casini and voted 'in favour ' .
i voted in favour of mr casini 's report .
it is just a important that the council join this register .
i would , however , like to express some reservation .
therefore , rule for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy .
we consider these structure to be the direct product of democratically elected body .
in writing . - transparency of political institution is a prerequisite for legitimacy .
therefore , rule for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy .
such an agreement would benefit from being joined by the council .
it is important to monitor the practical result of this .
in writing . - transparency of political institution is a prerequisite for legitimacy .
therefore , rule for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy .
the next objective will therefore be to make registration mandatory for all lobbyist .
therefore , rule for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy .
the common register is due to become available online in june .
in writing . - transparency of political institution is a prerequisite for legitimacy .
therefore , rule for lobbying are ultimately a question of legitimacy .
the proposed 'transparency register ' is nothing other than administrative legitimisation .
the lobbyist have a bright future ahead of them .
i shall vote against this hypocritical report , which i condemn .
a voluntary register is complete nonsense and will not result in increased transparency .
however , are there also control in place in the other direction ?
institution earn their credential by operating in a transparent manner .
the resolution wa adopted in plenary on 8 may 2008 .
transparency of political institution ' activity is a prerequisite for legitimacy .
once again , member have expressed their support for the introduction of transparency .
a common register of lobbyist will increase transparency in eu institution .
the decision concerning the so-called transparency register is not ambitious enough .
making exception for certain lobbyist will create loophole in the control system .
a code of conduct for lobbying activity is necessary .
mr casini 's report doe not meet these requirement .
no regulation should therefore restrict one of the basic right of citizen .
the report identifies solution to this , so i am voting in favour .
this is why we must avoid introducing barrier in financial institution .
to use the word crusade is perhaps to overstate the case .
therefore , i voted in favour of this report .
it emerged during the crisis in asia that regulation is a sensible precaution .
in writing . - we had to abstain at the end .
i have therefore voted in favour of this report .
the compromise wa impossible , the difference of opinion obvious and irreconcilable .
this is why focusing more attention on it would not do any harm .
the right 's rejection of these request is particularly regrettable .
moreover , the european union must not forget it founding principle .
this entailed a levelling-down of working and living condition .
this agreement with india mean that you are going even further .
in writing . - i voted for this resolution .
i think this resolution on the eu-india free trade agreement should be rejected .
for these reason , i have decided to vote against the resolution .
the ep is very much divided on the free trade agreement with india .
the very worst in the epp , ecr and alde compromise wa avoided .
i voted in favour of this important resolution on eu-japan trade relation .
moreover , the eu is japan 's third largest trading partner .
for these reason , i am voting for this report .
a such , our only option is to condemn and stridently oppose it .
not a single proposal for cooperation to help it out of this situation .
scarcely a single line of solidarity after japan 's only nuclear catastrophe .
there is , however , significant untapped trade potential .
it is unacceptable to have unequal commodity turnover between the eu and japan .
today , the european parliament adopted a resolution on eu-japan trade relation .
apart from that , japan is the seventh destination for european export .
continuing our dialogue with japan is an entirely positive move .
ironing out our difference will make an important contribution to both economy .
specie conservation and nursery practice should extend to associated microbial and fungal specie .
in situ research into mycorhizal symbiosis should be actively encouraged .
forest and wooded land cover 42 % of the european union 's surface .
we have also highlighted the challenge that climate change present to our forest .
the forest action plan adopted in 2006 set four important objective .
there are also more than 350 000 people employed in forest management .
europe 's large wooded area create considerable business and employment within the eu .
the arsenis report demonstrates the european parliament 's concern for forestry policy .
in recent time , we have witnessed disaster and storm threatening forest .
without forest , the consequence of climate change would be even more serious .
the eu ratio of felling to increment is stable at around 60 % .
however , there are some enormous challenge facing our forest .
one of the most important of these is climate change .
forest are an important source of livelihood and well-being within our border .
also , the concept of 'sustainability ' ha still not been defined .
in writing . - i voted for this important report .
in addition , 40 % of eu forest are state-owned .
the eu ratio of felling to increment is stable at around 60 % .
forest should be thought of a fundamental to combating climate change .
climate change and forest are inextricably bound up with each other .
the preservation of biodiversity must be a priority for our political action .
current environmental condition are responsible for bringing about change in european forest .
it go without saying that forest protection is a key environmental issue .
we must ensure that we avoid such a situation .
a special section is dedicated to the implementation of the treaty of lisbon .
one of these is the proposal for a uniform eu foreign policy .
there are two many fine distinction made by different country in the eu .
that is why i will vote against the report .
one ha to admit that it wa not the best decision .
this is only logical : diplomacy is a matter of state sovereignty .
they are specific to the union and often at odds with national interest .
it is wholly unreasonable that these interest should take precedence over national interest .
it stress and aim to promote a moratorium on execution .
it also indicates orientation and objective in cooperation with other country .
i believe that an organisation-to-organisation relationship must be adopted .
it ha just been elected a a non-permanent member of the security council .
some people even believe that these link should be strengthened .
for this reason , i have voted against this report .
in the end , the report wa adopted with an overwhelming majority .
this month , lithuania is marking the seventh anniversary of eu accession .
we have a historical obligation to make it a political union .
the cfsp should be one of the vehicle used to achieve that .
the international system is undergoing rapid and profound change .
indeed , the union ha become a preferred target of international crime .
the rapporteur ha worked very well together with my group .
many of our amendment have been turned into compromise text .
the treaty of lisbon wa a step forward for the eu .
the new reality will be more rational , more synergistic and more european .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the gualtieri report .
this is an encouraging example for further similar cooperation .
who would take the decision to mobilise european armed force ?
how much of a say would the new member state have ?
it welcome both organisation ' desire to further strengthen their partnership .
i am voting in favour of mr gualtieri 's report .
i strongly support the report , which call for better coordination of them .
the treaty of lisbon gave the eu security and defence policy more opportunity .
this policy became more integrated into eu foreign policy .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
that mean we need to get organised and get organised now .
this is the purpose and aim of this report .
that is why we adopted the treaty of lisbon .
when europe doe speak with one voice , it ha nothing to say .
this is also in accordance with the treaty of lisbon .
the european union 's commitment to effective multilateralism is particularly important .
each member state is entitled to express it own view within international body .
in writing . - i support the uk retaining membership of unsc .
the european union is today a true actor on the world stage .
this specific resolution strengthens the role of the eu in the multilateral system .
finally , the eu 's role in summit diplomacy is clarified .
the new member state have increased the union 's economic and demographic strength .
the european message ha changed : it ha become richer and more complex .
the eu must increase it independence and develop it dialogue with third country .
the international situation ha recently been changing ever more rapidly .
experience ha taught u that it is powerless in many case .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
that really would have been a step in the right direction .
i thank all the hungarian presidency representative for that .
we all worked together day and night to achieve a goal .
i invite you to take the floor on behalf of the council .
our european institution have suffered a major collective failure .
it is in this spirit that i turn to you today .
i have come not only to speak but also to listen to you .
we must not allow this agreement in principle to be lost .
indonesia is a key eu partner in south-east asia .
a delegation from parliament visited indonesia just a few month ago .
we hope that your visit will be fruitful and beneficial .
furthermore , the commission recognises the progress made during conciliation .
i welcome the conciliatory tone adopted by mr pittella and by the presidency .
unfortunately , the two side came from different planet .
others were considering the interest of the meat and agriculture industry .
you have listened to everything that we have to say on this subject .
we do not want these product on the european market .
that is your job and parliament is ready to support you .
i hope you will be able to submit a proposal very soon .
that is what we have been elected for and not for anything else .
madam president , i think that mr leinen put his finger on it .
i think that is the crux of the problem .
we have worked hard and we have also shown ourselves to be flexible .
i think that the rapporteur will be coming back to this issue shortly .
it must therefore also be this parliament that concludes it .
the real key here is the banning of offspring .
we were thus unable to reach a compromise on this issue .
i am now really curious to know what the real underlying reason were .
if they were aware of it , then disingenuous argument were used .
mr dalli , the citizen await your next move .
in my view , regulation must be brought forward very quickly now .
i will hand over the document to the council .
i think this is a crucial issue from a political standpoint .
i do not believe that any of this had a basis in fact .
for example , minced meat must be labelled in the usa .
those offspring are bred from clone who have suffered to be born .
i come from a country where food from cloned animal is prohibited .
however , cloning is nevertheless coming in through the back door .
the subject is often brought up in guarded secrecy outside the debate .
we must demand two thing : traceability and labelling .
european consumer must be able to make an informed choice .
madam president , i am afraid i will be le diplomatic .
cloned animal are very expensive to use for food .
it will be their descendant that are used for food .
i am afraid that your role in the negotiation wa not productive .
we are talking here about a number of subject and about legislation .
however , i believe that these scientific development are highly questionable .
however , the rapporteur deserves all our appreciation for her effort .
had we accepted the compromise , we would have found it empty .
this rule also applies when talking about food safety .
it is therefore essential to ensure that the public is made aware .
however , this is just one side of the coin .
madam president , are we really surprised that we did not reach agreement ?
this is also an issue which need to be addressed .
i believe that some member state have deliberately sabotaged the negotiation .
they have decided to protect the agriculture industry and defend it interest .
the ban on cloning is simply one step in the process .
cloning is not just a complex , but also a sensitive topic .
dolly the sheep wa neither the first nor the last cloned animal .
ten of thousand of other attempt end in failure .
i have a number of doubt about the new novel food regulation .
how will the movement of these food between european country be regulated ?
we have tried and are trying to act in this spirit .
this is worse than the council 's last offer would have been .
work is needed within and between government to accept this minimum .
( nl ) madam president , this is actually a point of order .
we must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our european enterprise .
why should small business owner have to submit a report more than once ?
the public authority should deal with the further distribution of the information themselves .
it is therefore not enough simply to reduce the number .
mr president , commissioner , i beg your pardon .
the small business act ha become incorporated into european thinking in recent time .
i would like to mention a few of these .
it is very important that the institutional network help small and medium-sized enterprise .
for this reason , the european enterprise network must be strengthened .
it is something we have to keep working on .
i am particularly concerned about the situation that micro-businesses find themselves in .
indeed , the broader question of finance for smes is vital .
californian venture capitalist expect nine out of ten investment to fail .
what opportunity will there be for small and medium-sized enterprise in this context ?
cip is already much le bureaucratic than the seventh framework programme .
more work is needed to enable u to make progress in these issue .
secondly , a new system of governance will be introduced .
smes generate job , growth and , accordingly , prosperity for society .
second , innovation , which is equally fundamental in this sector .
now the member state have two year to implement the new directive .
it also want smes to benefit from the growth in market .
i got no answer then , but now it seems i have some .
it should mean ripping rule out by the hundred .
i hope that what commissioner tajani ha said on several occasion come true .
meanwhile , the business environment varies greatly across the member state .
we see company going bankrupt or with a huge debt burden .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under
( lt ) thank you very much for this question .
after all , someone ha to put theory into practice .
at european level , it is essential that we tackle fraud in particular .
when our smes do well , the european economy doe well .
i want to thank you for your support in this regard .
we are organising this event together with the parliament and the commission .
mr bendtsen said , and i strongly agree with his standpoint .
allow me to draw your attention to a few specific matter .
there are two other specific matter i wish to mention .
lastly , allow me to mention the connection with the europe 2020 strategy .
among them is hungary , currently holding the presidency .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 may 2011 .
the single market act ha placed a strong emphasis on supporting smes .
smes encounter difficulty in obtaining access to funding and the market .
the future mff must provide measure for overcoming these difficulty .
we need to limit the administrative burden by simplifying the regulatory environment .
development in the ongoing debt crisis and the eu response ( debate )
we have a number of tool at our disposal to do this .
non-eurozone member state are also participating in this process .
this programme ha been kept under constant review by the new government .
the technical detail of the implementation of this agreement are currently under discussion .
this followed a period of intense pressure from the financial market .
the financial envelope will be around eur 78 billion covering a three-year period .
it is a demanding but fair and necessary programme of adjustment .
it will require major effort on the part of the portuguese people .
a new round of bank stress test is being conducted .
the result will guide the necessary restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking sector .
this continues to call for very difficult decision at european and national level .
i trust we all have the wisdom and courage to take such decision .
i hope that the party in question learn very quickly from this .
the package must pave the way for sustainable public finance and economic growth .
( nl ) mr president , i have a question for mr wortmann-kool .
you need a new strategy because the current strategy is not working .
also , the cost of supporting the weaker country is constantly rising .
what is your view of these unplanned liability within the euro system ?
the proposal for a european restructuring system ha been delayed .
these country are still subject to a growing burden of interest .
the export and outflow of capital in some of these country is increasing .
mr figueiredo , i am afraid i have cut off your microphone .
i apologise for this but you went quite over time .
if that trouble you , you should just leave !
i have been prudent and i have worked moderately hard .
let me explain , because i do not think you really understand .
let me explain to you that these country are broke .
they are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politician .
for god 's sake , let u all admit it .
i wa not suggesting my politician were any le stupid than anybody else .
this remedy will be no more effective tomorrow than it wa yesterday .
greece is becoming a third-world country , ruining all hope of reimbursement .
pursuing this path is suicidal and will lead to the fragmentation of europe .
this solidarity is what ha just happened with portugal .
i should like to say something to you a a portuguese .
portugal is capable of putting it public account in order with discipline .
thirty per cent of international monetary reserve are denominated in euro .
more than a third of international private borrowing is carried out in euro .
you are definitely wrong , mr helmer , because it is about solidarity .
however , right now , these country need our help and assistance .
you are a part of europe and you can do more .
( interjection from mr helmer : 'absolutely no ! )
one year later , we are back at square one .
will you eventually change tack in order to address the problem ?
that is an inevitable reality - the question is 'when ? '
is he not therefore arguing against job in the netherlands ?
it is a disgrace that you have not grasped that fact .
in this context , i would like to raise two issue .
this double challenge make achieving debt sustainability practically impossible .
what is at issue is a loan , not a gift .
( fi ) mr president , i have good news for the portuguese .
today 's awe-inspiring general strike in greece will send a strong fighting message ...
is that the solution that we need to turn back to ?
mr rangel , i have a question for you .
for god 's sake , let the centre unite .
( fi ) mr president , this debate ha been useful .
it is the poorly regulated bank that were irresponsible .
the actual crisis is therefore rather a crisis of the european banking sector .
the next step should then be effective regulation of the financial sector .
it is a question of no pain , no gain .
that is why i want to reply to you now .
this mean that the citizen are working hard and earning a great deal .
the eu did not intervene here with financial aid .
in other word , a strict fiscal policy ha been introduced .
let u think about what the consequence of debt restructuring could be .
this is how it could very likely turn out .
a restructuring of sovereign security would seriously erode their capital base .
let me recall that argentinian gdp collapsed by almost half over five year .
greece still ha a large fiscal deficit which it ha to finance .
who would be ready to lend to greece the morning after ?
belgium successfully did so in the 1990s for almost a decade .
this is the only way for greece to avoid much worse alternative .
we really are at a critical juncture concerning the future of europe .
it ha implication for the euro , for the future of europe .
we need to find the energy together to beat this fatigue .
implementing both priority ha reached an important , critical stage .
for greece , the stress is on putting the budget in order .
the process of foreign intervention under way is very revealing of this .
a for the sacrosanct market , they are now setting the tone .
commission and government have just one obsession : to reassure them .
it go without saying that the eu must respond to the crisis .
a total of 91 major european bank were tested and 7 failed .
the commission attache great importance to the european union agency ' efficient functioning .
therefore , the commission should be aware that we are on it side .
we must exert greater pressure with regard to the agency .
there are a number of good argument for doing so .
we have supervisory body with more member than the agency have employee .
if i remember correctly , both organisation were founded in 1975 .
by the way , i did not make this up myself .
i will be happy to make these document available to you .
doe the commission apply efficiency and performance criterion to these agency ?
secondly , how do the agency perform against the criterion ?
can the commission show parliament an analysis of the agency ' performance ?
we have heard about synergy ; we want to see them .
who set the objective and strategy of the agency ?
i have looked at the website of these four agency .
we must prevent duplication of effort by merging the agency .
except that it purpose is not economic or financial , it is political .
that is what you should work to achieve , mr andor .
therefore , be open in your thinking on this matter .
i think that this is a very one-sided approach .
we can not therefore underestimate the role played by cedefop .
the report for 2010 confirmed my belief regarding cedefop 's effectiveness .
however , no discharge wa approved for the police college based in britain .
m gräßle , you want the floor for one minute ?
if we want to retain the agency , we need to change them .
i can only ask you to join u in our effort .
that is the point i would like to emphasise .
we owe this to our citizen and our taxpayer .
i believe that there is plenty of room for improvement .
there are no other area where four agency are working in parallel .
elsewhere , the job is done by one agency .
we should not only be discussing whether a merger should take place .
otherwise , i would like to see them closed .
if we find weakness or waste , we have to address them .
( the sitting wa suspended at 19:25 and resumed at 21:00 )
innovation union : transforming europe for a post-crisis world ( debate )
this will not happen on it own , of course .
so , what are the specific measure that we could take ?
innovation need to be something that run through every area of policy .
that therefore ha to be the political mindset , too .
that is the mission for u , a politician .
at the moment , that market is much too compartmentalised .
up to now , innovation ha predominantly been seen a a high-tech product .
well , innovation union will make the best use of public money .
this mean prioritising smart fiscal consolidation , despite severe budget constraint .
for their part , government must draw up programme for developing innovation .
they are also the one to recover fastest from recession .
information and communication technology ( ict ) is important in all innovative activity .
this is not the vision of the future that we need .
this mean that there are huge expectation and that we must deliver .
that is what i understand the innovation union is offering .
eu policy response and eu budgetary instrument must move firmly against that logic .
it need to be applied across the entire european territory .
promoting innovation-led growth is not about increasing excellence in r & d infrastructure .
succeeding in this will be a challenge for europe .
i am also delighted with the excellent idea from commissioner geoghegan-quinn .
european state clearly operate at a very high level in research project .
the fund for science and research is one of the largest eu fund .
this , in itself , is already a major challenge .
this , of course , radically transforms the context .
a great many thing have been said with which we agree .
there are just two point i would like to raise .
firstly , we need to maximise the impact of each euro spent .
the best way of doing that is not always by contributing non-repayable money .
i believe that she ha done a very good job .
we need to encourage a culture of learning , curiosity and risk-taking .
this is not just about introducing technical innovation , but also socio-political innovation .
this will be of benefit to consumer and the environment .
unfortunately , there are also innovation which have the opposite effect .
this is what mr merkies referred to in her speech .
i would like to mention briefly one other issue .
how can we increase the effectiveness of our investment in research ?
a mr merkies ha said , le is often more .
mr president , mr reul , thank you for your speech .
however , perhaps we do not need to impose regulation covering every detail .
commissioner , the commission communication refers to partnership in the innovation sector .
for that reason , we must give ourselves the mean to strengthen innovation .
( c ) mr president , europe and innovation .
i believe that business and the citizen are watching on .
the report , and your proposal for the innovation union , generate expectation .
will you agree with this in the forthcoming regulation ?
what kind of proposal will this be covered by ?
how will you organise that from here on in ?
in fact , i have a lot of faith in that .
along with mr merkies , we will keep a close eye on you .
i hope that this amendment will receive majority support tomorrow .
i think that this notion is neither feasible nor fair .
it is essential to the creation of small and medium-sized enterprise .
additional factor include active commitment from smes and the involvement of european citizen .
the commission should focus on technology which underpin smarter , sustainable system .
however , better service also require an improvement in vocational training .
we also need productive cooperation between the various stakeholder .
thirdly , we need to develop the european patent .
a number of speaker raised the role of the region .
indeed , m merkies underline that point in her report .
all the region of europe should play to their strength .
both are extremely important , but innovation need to get an extra push .
let u really try to get a different mindset .
let u spend the money , but let u change the policy .
let u start a movement : a movement for innovation .
innovation mean the successful implementation of idea in practice .
ilo convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic worker ( debate )
we , too , must lead the way on this point .
we hope that the legal recognition of domestic work can be achieved .
the institutional context need to be borne in mind .
that is why the union can not ratify ilo convention itself .
we will be putting forward those guiding principle next year .
we have already mentioned that there are black hole in labour law regulation .
we have problem regarding the health and safety of these worker .
we have many initiative in hand at the moment .
one solution might be the use of model contract .
i believe that contract of a similar type operate in belgium .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for his answer .
it can quite often involve nursing care and various aspect of child development .
domestic worker often occupy a real position of trust .
so we need to look at how we identify that form of trafficking .
i also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint .
between 5 % and 9 % of all employee work in private household .
action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the european commission .
firstly , there are gap in the definition in the ilo convention .
i would first like to highlight an initial point .
this is unacceptable discrimination that must be put right .
they are also not included in the european framework directive .
there are still a few problem , for example , in the definition .
article 1 should cover not only domestic work , but also household service .
it is , therefore , of the greatest importance to tackle this problem .
this is one way of circumventing minimum working condition .
some of these people even have bogus self-employed status .
to conclude the debate , i have received one motion for a resolution .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 may , at noon .
twelve additional member state are voluntarily starting to collect these data .
the aim is to broaden the system to cover all eu member state .
antimicrobial agent are undoubtedly very useful when properly used .
i would now like to see the commission take action .
there are three point that i want to make .
madam president , lady and gentleman , this is a very serious issue .
only 10 member state have provided information and that is too few .
these people already have huge problem in this area .
this is why the resolution being debated today is an important document .
the most important word in any discussion on this subject is 'caution ' .
we must ensure that antibiotic are used responsibly in all the member state .
we need more research and more information in europe about these alternative approach .
we need to be a bit balanced in this debate .
the use of antibiotic in animal involves closely linked advantage and disadvantage .
at the same time , we must also reduce the risk for people .
up to 25 000 people die from it every year .
simply through the irresponsible use of antibiotic in veterinary medicine .
some of these action may require change in legislation .
the key is to select the right tool for the task in hand .
there are various tool here : education , awareness-raising campaign and so on .
and yes , we do have a timetable for action .
legislative proposal , a i already mentioned , will follow in 2012 .
to conclude the debate , i have received one motion for a resolution .
the vote will take place on thursday , 12 may , at noon .
it particularly affect level of antibiotic resistance and so ha human health repercussion .
mr de castro referred to the measure that have already been taken .
there are two aspect of this which i would like to focus on .
the collection of this data should be mandatory for all eu member state .
a scenario such a this could have catastrophic consequence for human health .
request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity : see minute
eu-mauritania fishery partnership agreement ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
public procurement ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
we have had quite a few meeting and conference .
those condition are most certainly linked to the modernisation of school education system .
the european economy very much need vocational qualification in the next decade .
however , continuing the reform of the bologna process is even more important .
so we have everything to do on this and it is all beneficial .
staff qualification are extremely important and they are very lacking in this area .
but there is no need to reinvent the wheel .
it is important that the eu develop a strategy for internet freedom .
the cultural dimension of the eu 's external policy can not be overestimated .
we need people who have experienced europe thanks to improved mobility opportunity .
i will now turn to another subject , namely sarajevo .
sarajevo ha a special place in european history and culture .
the cultural life of the city ha never stopped .
the winter festival took place even under the most adverse of circumstance .
what place doe europe want to give to culture ?
what influence do we want for our work and our creation ?
in 2003 , this sector generated a turnover of eur 654 billion .
that is more than the automotive industry and the agri-food industry put together .
a well a being economic asset , they sustain and enrich cultural diversity .
firstly , putting education and training at the heart of our strategy .
secondly , it is essential that we adapt copyright to the digital era .
the third vital component of our strategy should be the protection of creativeness .
creativeness that is undermined is creativeness that is doomed to disappear .
private investor are too often reluctant when it come to funding smes .
we have no intention of publishing league table of university .
it will mark a further step in our ambition to extend mobility opportunity .
investing early is much more effective than intervening later .
we also share the view that their potential is not fully developed .
in the face of repeated conflict , sarajevo ha retained it multicultural spirit .
parliament and the council adopted the current decision le than five year ago .
mr president , let u get back on topic .
this transition must take place without time spent waiting around .
we felt that the role of traineeship wa important .
that is also a major advantage for later working life .
i now turn to the 'youth on the move ' scheme .
work placement must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection .
we have been elected to provide an answer to that .
we look forward to broad support in this chamber .
the freedom of speech must be available for everyone .
nevertheless , it is good that we are dealing with these issue .
the economic crisis is being particularly harsh on young people .
firstly , i believe it is of the utmost importance to promote mobility .
indeed , it is essential to foster entrepreneurship programme for university student .
we need young people to take an active part in the economy .
however , this is not true of the whole of europe .
more specifically , i will restrict my speech to three issue .
further measure need to be taken in this area .
such a requirement is ridiculous and discriminatory and must be looked at closely .
this is the procedure in both the public and private sector .
it is our cultural value that characterise our european community .
in paragraph 17 , it condemns totalitarian regime which use censorship .
in all these area , the report is worthy of support and praise .
this is something to which attention should be called .
this is why my attitude to this report is simply one of ambivalence .
i strongly urge the commission to continue it work in these area .
worse , nearly 25 % of young people under 15 have reading difficulty .
let u hope that these will not be empty word !
this mobility will guarantee continued health and prosperity for europe .
this will permit systematic monitoring of member state ' progress in dismantling barrier .
this would benefit both old and young , student and worker .
university programme must be brought closer to the demand of the labour market .
creative industry are an important part of economic policy .
the absurdity is the tax applied to dematerialised cultural asset from two aspect .
i think that we need to address these two issue through legislation .
now , however , we have to look to the future .
without this , we will not be able to achieve anything .
germany , too , is very successful in this area .
there is much that we can learn from each other in these area .
lady and gentleman , commissioner , let u give sarajevo a chance !
parent have the main responsibility for raising and educating their child .
that equates to around 2.5 % of the total population .
the cultural and creative sector is a driver for europe .
you look out on the world and it is already yours ' .
mr president , youth on the move contains many encouraging initiative .
however , i feel obliged to urge a note of caution .
one third of the citizen of europe do not have any vocational qualification .
funding is the greatest obstacle to growth for many business .
the initiative we are discussing here this morning would facilitate that .
i have called for an indigenous festival of sport in europe .
my last point is that i visited mannheim last year .
this is something that could be emulated in other place .
it is an initiative that other region and country should follow .
lady and gentleman , we only value , we only appreciate ...
we must give the right support to child and young people .
the result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequality .
the reality is that budget for culture are being slashed to penury level .
education , lifelong learning , innovation and culture certainly lead to progress .
we must ensure that no one be left out for financial reason .
we have to really give our full attention to our education system .
i think that cutting our budget on education is a very short-sighted policy .
i would now like to look further down the road with you .
how are we going to follow up on this report ?
why not also consider a single price for digital book across europe ?
a wind of freedom is blowing on the arab world .
cultural and educational exchange encourage the emergence of an organised civil society .
today 's young people are the leader of tomorrow .
language education also ha a prominent role in cultural understanding .
young people are the driving force of any society and it future .
around the world generally , european culture is seen a attractive and desirable .
it is more difficult to find acceptance for european value .
this quite often meet with a lack of understanding from our partner .
on this , the union is united and in full accord .
educated citizen are the greatest enemy of dictator and totalitarian regime .
the experience of eu member state can be used when organising such programme .
this is precisely why the cultural and creative industry must be encouraged .
another aspect is to encourage study grant offered to student by private company .
a lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda .
yesterday afternoon , an earthquake struck the spanish province of murcia .
three hour ago , mr martínez martínez made a statement about this .
we wish all those who have been injured a rapid return to health .
cleanup in europe and let 's do it world 2012 ( written declaration )
mr president , i want to thank everybody for supporting this initiative .
european fishery sector crisis due to rise in oil price ( vote )
innovation union : transforming europe for a post-crisis world (
ilo convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic worker ( vote )
sarajevo a a european capital of culture in 2014 ( vote )
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
this is one of the success story of eu policy .
what a high price we expect our constituent to pay for our conceit !
( pl ) madam president , child are our future .
we should therefore stress the importance of upbringing rather than education .
this agenda is within the exclusive competence of the member state .
hence , the ecological calamity which ha befallen stock in the north sea .
that , i am afraid , make them icelandic property .
it is our bad luck and their good luck .
thirdly , simply making the fuel cheaper will not achieve this aim .
( ga ) madam president , i wa pleased to support these recommendation .
fishing - like farming - is a very precarious occupation .
let u not put ideology in the place of assistance .
mr mitchell , i am going to ask you a question .
could you tell u what those initial stand for ?
madam president , i am glad you said that .
however , i want to focus on another point .
it is time that we said : no more !
to achieve these objective , we need to work together for innovation .
( pl ) madam president , i endorsed the report on innovation union .
innovation is , of course , crucial for europe 's development .
we also need to ensure that we have much more effective management .
this take it toll on the nerve , take time and cost money .
obviously , all member state need to take part in such an analysis .
fourthly , what we do not need is ideological bogeyman .
( fi ) madam president , this report is worthy of our support .
in international policy , culture is of major importance .
culture is also linked to human wellbeing and coping generally .
trade and finance have taken priority over human right .
it symbolises the development that have taken place in europe .
it would certainly have greater significance for a wider europe .
it would certainly have greater significance for a wider europe .
the youth on the move initiative is part of the europe 2020 strategy .
to support and strengthen these measure , i am voting for this report .
a 'european quality charter for mobility ' wa even created .
only , seven year later , the same obstacle are still there .
for these reason , we abstained from the final vote .
the reality , then , is a sharp divestment in these area .
the result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequality .
the reality is that budget for culture are being slashed to penury level .
in writing . - i voted for the zver report .
popular common sense say that 'travel broadens the mind ' .
at the present time , we must not forget young people .
this is why i endorsed mr zver 's report .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
student mobility is clearly a central component of the europe 2020 strategy .
moreover , student mobility is one of the major challenge of european integration .
youth unemployment within the eu ha reached a high of 21 % .
european union member state are facing a high rate of youth unemployment .
in some country , it is even touching 21 % .
that is double the average unemployment rate for adult .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
mobility programme should be available to vocational student , teacher and youth worker .
we call for eu-wide recognition of school , vocational and university qualification .
this undermines the stock of qualification that europe will need in the future .
i endorsed the report on improving europe 's education and training system .
these programme have achieved great success in the union .
promoting the mobility of young people requires practical barrier to be overcome .
sadly , the prospect for young people in lithuania today are rather bleak .
child 's early learning lay the foundation for their successful lifelong learning .
europe is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational tradition .
in this regard , we need flexible and innovative early childhood education programme .
furthermore , these early year lay the foundation for child 's lifelong learning .
this report is on early year learning in the european union .
we all know that you build a house from the foundation up .
an education with a robust , quality foundation guarantee european a better future .
the preparation of human resource is more important than the quality of building .
these are determinant of child 's healthy and balanced mental and physical growth .
education can not be at the mercy of the logic of the market .
these are determinant of child 's healthy and balanced mental and physical growth .
education can not be at the mercy of the logic of the market .
the gem in this report is at paragraph 14 .
i feel that the member state should devote appropriate resource to ecec service .
young people from vulnerable social group are particularly at risk .
we must care for future generation and the quality of their education .
by young child we mean child up to the age of six .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
it lead him or her to the rudiment of reading and of arithmetic .
for the reason mentioned , i support the position of the rapporteur .
the well-being of the child is not central to this motion .
language acquisition is the basis of logical thinking and contextual understanding .
the report offer no meaningful attempt to solve this problem .
like the rapporteur , i call for even more ambitious goal .
the aptitude for multilingualism should be remembered , for example .
for me , education must be a political priority .
unfortunately , we are still a long way from these figure .
i endorsed the report on early year learning in the eu .
i would like to call particular attention to three matter .
my final observation concern the need for universal access to childcare centre .
therefore , the commission intends to launch negotiation regarding it renewal .
it is also necessary that mauritania ratify the relevant international fishery instrument .
surveillance should also be strengthened and illegal vessel impounded .
apart from that , the resolution includes several positive aspect , such a :
similar restriction also exist in term of access to third-country tender .
that demonstrates real awareness and represents a positive and necessary change .
it is now for the commission to ass this call fully .
this is yet another attempt to push through the liberalisation of public procurement .
however , to achieve this , these must operate effectively .
it is now for the commission to size up this call .
i am voting for this joint motion for a resolution .
it is positive that parliament ha adopted this resolution .
i hope the commission and the council will give the resolution serious consideration .
i voted for the resolution and against all the amendment which were tabled .
the cost of fishing is very dependent on the price of oil .
it is an irresponsible mistake to spend public money to maintain this fleet .
i voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
smes are essential to the european economy 's dynamism .
the current financial crisis ha had a negative impact on these company .
we have another resolution full of contradiction before u .
finally , smes play an essential role in european innovation .
smes represent 99 % of business in the european union .
the small business act is a good proposal for small and medium-sized enterprise .
there need to be a differentiation between micro , small and medium-sized business .
i am abstaining to encourage the intention and denounce the hypocrisy .
two-thirds of job in the private sector are provided by the sme base .
more than half of european added value is produced by smes .
smes play a key role in innovation , research and development .
what is needed is a common path towards an equitable and stable economy .
such action would enable them to play an active role in innovation .
there is a future provided that there is innovation .
they would also have to shoulder the additional cost of translation .
i have therefore decided not to support the report .
innovation in many respect is the key to economic growth .
the eu must fully commit to achieving the proposed objective .
we will only emerge from the crisis if we support innovation .
without them , financing and other mechanism are of no use .
european score in term of innovation have remained rather poor until now .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
what is needed is a common path towards an equitable and stable economy .
those are the reason why i am voting in favour .
through our resolution , we support the ambition displayed by the ilo .
domestic work make up between 5 % and 9 % of total employment .
this work is often insecure , undervalued and undeclared .
that is why i voted for this motion for a resolution .
the severely exploitative and discriminatory condition under which they work are well known .
there is therefore an obvious need to regulate domestic work .
this situation is the reason why i voted for the resolution .
domestic worker are often penalised for the informal nature of their work .
these job often lack correct contract and social benefit .
it will supplement other convention of the ilo or of other international organisation .
for the ilo , 2010 wa the year of domestic worker .
an agenda must be established for sharing research , knowledge and best practice .
amr in human is often caused by inadequate dos of antibiotic medicine .
the excessive use of antibiotic lead to resistance and adaptation among pathogen .
many of the well-known antibiotic have today become either ineffective or unreliable .
today , parliament adopted an important decision on antibiotic resistance .
this is why antibiotic need to be used with caution in animal husbandry .
in writing . - antibiotic resistance is a serious public health issue .
antimicrobial resistance can be transmitted from human to animal and vice versa .
hospital patient and farmer are at particular risk of exposure to resistant bacteria .
animal husbandry play a key role in the european economy .
in writing . - with this , the ep : 1 .
amongst other us , they are fed to animal on a preventative basis .
in order to prevent this , it is necessary to follow medical instruction .
we can react rapidly and effectively only if we know the true situation .
a wind of freedom is blowing on the arab world .
cultural and educational exchange encourage the emergence of an organised civil society .
the european union is known for it variety of cultural form .
instead , the eu ha chosen an inward-looking language policy .
i hope it will be up to the challenge .
this is a report that misrepresents and exploit the notion of culture .
consequently , this strategy is absolutely essential for the eu .
europe is the cradle of an exceptionally rich and varied culture .
it is important that we cultivate and preserve this multiculturality .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
europe is a community of freedom , responsibility and democratic value .
europe is a community of freedom , responsibility and democratic value .
it represents the exercising of a right , including the right to denounce .
we always hear that cultural diversity must be promoted .
it is estimated to account for 2.6 % of european gdp at present .
this report is on the cultural dimension of the eu 's external action .
for all these reason , i voted for this report .
those are the reason why i am voting in favour .
the green insisted on the promotion of 'cultural cooperation ' instead .
this is why i support strengthening external action in that direction .
resource for culture are often scattered across a host of project .
efficient use of these fund is further hampered by political fragmentation .
i therefore support the recommendation contained in this report .
this 'brand europe ' must be borne by true ambassador .
the cultural sector also attracts well-qualified , creative people .
the cultural sector also attracts well-qualified , creative people .
the european union must introduce measure to support the creative sector .
creating effective alternative is the best way to combat piracy .
the cultural and creative industry ( ccis ) make a number of contribution .
therefore , i voted in favour of this report .
that is why i am voting in favour of this report .
only an ambitious and joint approach can preserve the uniqueness of european culture .
despite adversity , the city maintains it cultural spirit .
i consider it positive and fair that sarajevo be european capital of culture .
our challenge now is to rebuild the bridge between the community .
it can help them now to achieve european multiculturalism once again .
sarajevo deserves to be given the chance to demonstrate it huge potential .
sarajevo is surrounded by an atmosphere which is both multicultural and european .
bosnians , meanwhile , are characterised by great friendliness and hospitality .
sarajevo is looking to it european future with great enthusiasm .
it want to demonstrate it huge potential and promote itself to european .
sarajevo occupies a very important place in european ' historical consciousness .

sri lanka : follow-up of the un report ( debate )
of course , the final stage of the ltte campaign were awful .
how would you like there to be reconciliation of a people ?
it is on both side , mr van orden .
it is by both side that justice must be done .
that is the only message that i should like to pas on today .
the report stressed the need for accountability on both side .
i believe that it is an objective reason for further investigation .
war crime must never go unpunished , no matter where they occur .
the tamil tiger are suspected of shooting civilian trying to flee .
these are both serious crime and they can not be ignored .
a sense of responsibility is vital for the reconciliation process .
the eu must support effort to strengthen sri lanka 's sense of responsibility .
in sri lanka , the civilian population wa bombed , among other atrocity .
ever since , guernica ha been a universal symbol for peace and resistance .
however , it is everyone 's wish to make progress towards reconciliation .
it is absurd to accuse the sri lankan government of genocide .
i would hope that the member would retract that statement .
however , i have made it clear that it wa not the name .
they know sri lanka and they know what is going on .
i do not know where m delli is getting all this nonsense from .
mr president , sri lanka is a ravaged land .
in that country , the united nation failed badly .
thousand of civilian were killed between january and may 2009 .
the tamil tiger have their share of the responsibility for these horror .
we can only welcome the report of 11 april .
the resolution before u today is going in the right direction .
for my part , i should have liked it to go even further .
this happens irrespective of how we define a just war .
i hardly need remind colleague here of china 's approach to human right .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on azerbaijan .
the democratic situation in that country is dramatic enough .
mr president , i will begin with some encouraging news .
otherwise , however , the situation is more than worrying in azerbaijan .
europe also loses credibility if we do not act upon these breach .
they should have real consequence for the relation between the eu and azerbaijan .
lady and gentleman , commissioner , that is unacceptable !
this situation now represents a security risk for the entire region .
here , i would specially mention the case of mr hajiyev .
however , my group can not share mr vigenin 's view .
it people are subject to arbitrary and sometimes violent treatment by official .
surely the partnership ought to require a respect for european value .
mr president , the situation in azerbaijan is very disappointing .
( lt ) mr president , there are two face to modern azerbaijan .
freedom of assembly is another area where i am deeply worried .
the detention of activist and other repressive measure against protester are deeply deplorable .
i welcome the willingness of azerbaijan to discus these method .
democracy is based on people 's freely expressed desire .
the next item is the debate on six motion for resolution on belarus .
i should like to address one further remark to mr tannock .
i know how hard it is to speak quickly in english .
their absence is justified because mp in minsk are not elected freely .
i think that two important thing need to be done :
1. an independent inquiry must be held into the act of repression
it is within our capacity to make a difference .
regime transition is desperately needed for the people of belarus .
i would like to stress that the trial were held behind closed door .
i consider that this conduct of the trial lacked impartiality .
mr president , belarus is not called europe 's last dictatorship for nothing .
belarus keep on violating all fundamental right and civil liberty .
secondly , i want to make the case for multilingualism .
( pl ) mr president , i will begin on a personal note .
the antidemocratic power in belarus is concentrated very much in the president .
you can be against ferenc gyurcsány , or for him .
you can disapprove of mr göncz , or you can support her .
i ask for an extremely tolerant and balanced attitude towards everyone .
we are moving ahead on the issue of visa facilitation .
we remain committed to a policy of critical engagement in belarus .
what ha the union done to secure their release ?
the economic crisis in belarus is the best time for change .
all international aid should be made dependent on democratic change in belarus .

happily , this did not happen in these country .
in many place , almost 50 % of the deportee died .
the 1941 deportation delivered a devastating blow to democratic civil society .
this led to the feeling that justice could never prevail .
these expulsion are among the darkest event of european history .
we remember the so-called population exchange between turkey and greece .
these were call that were made immediately after the second world war .
it wa equally a major blow to european solidarity and european togetherness .
despite this , we can end on an optimistic note .
more than 65 year have passed since the second world war .
it destroyed people 's moral value , tradition , solidarity , and self-confidence .
without prior warning and without charge , people were taken from their home .
in estonia , 14 june is a national day of commemoration .
we have known for a long time that gross national product is inadequate .
we therefore know exactly what is happening in these area .
however , we have an incomplete patchwork of data on the environmental impact .
we have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiation with the council .
then there is the financial expenditure arising from environmental tax and environmental charge .
in this regard , our methodology is probably still in need of improvement .
thus , we have achieved improvement in this area .
that is a very important point that we should include here .
mr president , i agree with the previous speaker .
we need access to clearer and more reliable indicator in this area .
we now have an opportunity to obtain these fact .
we now have an opportunity to work with a broader perspective .
there is also considerable value in coordinating environmental statistic at european level .
these cost that no one pay are diverted onto society instead .
why is sustainable energy more expensive than conventional energy ?
the collection of such data should therefore be compulsory and harmonised .
however , there are new shortage of natural resource .
we need other incentive to boost productivity and quality .
( de ) we have been elected a member of the european parliament .
with regard to statistic , you talked of sovietisation .
mr president , let me make the first point .
the u dollar is usually used a the currency for comparison .
even someone like mr nuttall can not disagree with that .
therefore , i would say that this is a positive first step .
i would like to thank the commission and the rapporteur .
we really do need to proceed with environmental economic account .
we can no longer consider the economy and the environment separately .
another , simpler , daily example is that of fire .
in the long term , it will be poorer than it wa before .
the environmental economic account we are calling for today are not perfect .
however , they are an important step in the right direction .
for this reason , we will abstain during the vote .
that is the main task that we a politician should set ourselves .
by doing so , we will have taken the first crucial decision .
equivalent , comparable data from all of the member state is the goal .
the question arises a to what we can actually discover from this data .
i am not a optimistic a the rapporteur and my fellow member .
wanting something is one thing ; putting it into practice is quite another .
such programme must also be developed without additional financial expenditure and bureaucracy .
on the other hand , we need transparency and comparability .
on the contrary , we have entered an interactive phase .
interaction between the economy and the environment are clearly evident here .
let me make a few point in response to a number of remark .
this is the first regulation , with three module .
madam president , lady and gentleman , thank you for the debate .
with a few exception , this ha found favour here .
one member , mr gerbrandy , said that measurement brings knowledge .
we quite simply need a better basis for the decision that we take .
these environmental account can help u in this regard .
europe is also under a global obligation , mr nuttall .
the commission fully support the candidacy of minister christine lagarde .
you can tell where i am going with this .
viewed from this angle , too , she is an outstanding candidate .
there will be no internal protection without external protection .
since then , however , the situation ha changed considerably .
the region in which imf intervention is crucial today is europe .
madam president , thank you for your response , mr rehn .
i believe we have all found her to be a very competent person .
she also ha the support of several member state and the european commission .
why , therefore , ha this opportunity not been taken ?
we need a stronger imf that operates a a global lender .
finally , mr rehn , sometimes we need to make a leap forward .
that doe nothing to enhance the european union 's credibility .
this is a missed opportunity a far a i am concerned .
secondly , i should like to respond to mr swinburne .
on this issue , commissioner , i do hold you responsible .
we can not permit this state of affair a european .
i would have thought this is a very poor choice .
we really must approach this issue dynamically and with a sense of perspective .
the voting right of emerging country should be significantly increased .
she is a person whose credibility can not be called into question .
european thinking should therefore be present in this institution .
redistribution is only possible if there is actually something produced to be redistributed .
it ha to be open , transparent and merit-based .
that would be detrimental to economic growth and improving employment in europe .
thirdly , i do agree that we need to reform our external representation .
it doe not speak with one coherent voice , but with many voice .
seventh eu programme for research , technological development and demonstration ( debate )
the second new element : the failure of the constitutional treaty .
eur 26 billion ha been programmed for the first three year .
we need to simplify the future and put the past behind u .
we must also honour our international commitment , such a iter .
i believe that this debate today mark one of those significant step .
let me make a few brief introductory remark on the report itself .
the commission look forward to continuing this debate through the forthcoming discussion .
without risk , we will not achieve the good result that we want .
the current framework programme is strategically important for competitiveness and employability within europe .
of it funding , 50 % is yet to be spent .
finally , i welcome the guideline for the next framework programme .
only in this way will europe become more competitive and prosperous .
i have three priority when we negotiate the eighth framework programme .
secondly , we must have the courage to aim for freedom and flexibility .
the question is whether it result are worthy of this major investment .
that is the idea expressed in paragraph 9 of the report .
europe must give itself the mean to achieve specific major objective .
commissioner , i still think you can do more for simplification .
we also must not compromise that principle of excellence .
i think that the review of this seventh framework programme is absolutely crucial .
small and medium-sized enterprise ( smes ) continue to present an important challenge .
i think this is an important step for parliament .
thirdly , i strongly support the marie curie action .
everyone say that we will , but it will be difficult .
how will we manage to use the existing resource more efficiently ?
alongside the question of adequate funding , that is another key issue .
that is not the principle we should use for research fund .
research fund can only be allocated according to the principle of excellence .
last but not least , we must fund fewer project .
it also ha the highest social standard and respect worker at work .
i think we can be proud of this fact .
i believe this will pay dividend in the future .
the rapporteur correctly placed great emphasis on this aspect .
this wa mentioned in merely one sentence in the report .
in short , this is definitely the number one issue !
we all agree that the budget should match our ambition .
obviously , these two major enlargement have increased diversity in the european union .
you could wonder , though , if that actually is the real reason .
this opportunity should also be available in the next financial perspective .
we also need to enhance the competition and innovation programme ( cip ) .
we need simple and clear rule , consistently and rigorously applied ' .
what becomes clear is that scientific research in europe is top quality .
excellence must take root in the region and the city .
over the coming year , we need to make use of the conditionality .
secondly , mr carvalho , of course , you have done very well .
i think there are three thing that should be underlined .
so once again , my thanks to the rapporteur .
great praise is due to the rapporteur , mr audy .
if we have that , then we will get result .
finally , we have failed with the lisbon strategy .
i would also argue that we should focus on performance .
it is also about fund from the euratom programme .
it is particularly strong in some eu member state .
there were also an unprecedented number of position paper .
reply came from all country of the european union and beyond .
i speak on behalf of all those who hold you in high esteem .
a mr reul said , we must , of course , encourage excellence .
the aim is better coordination with the member state .
however , the mid-term review revealed several area that need to be developed .
the first and most urgent task would be the simplification of bureaucratic burden .
science doe not exist a an end in itself .
today , around one third of research is funded under the facility .
this would also contribute to an improved use of fund .
funding cancer research can save people 's life and cut treatment cost .
such provision will be fully integrated within the trade agreement .
the different legislation of the individual province is an additional problematic aspect .
specific commitment need to be entered into on the canadian side .
they must be dealt with before this agreement come to conclusion .
we are concerned about the impact that ceta will have on procurement .
canada is , for instance , opposed to the eu 's gmo policy .
indeed , we should all welcome this enhancement and diversification of global energy .
those are extremely appealing prospect , particularly in economically strained time .
therefore , this is also one of the most important free trade agreement .
i would like to mention the trade in service in particular .
we must ensure that we do not allow the negotiation to slow down .
what is clearly important is to create more free trade .
these are not mere detail or point to be left for another day .
a for the environment , we are concerned and call for investment .
that would be to lose our sense of perspective .
is it the canadian court or those in the european union ?
this should be commended and further cooperation should be encouraged .
i am very pleased that the commissioner mentioned this in her presentation .
that is why i tabled an amendment on this subject .
in this regard , i must highlight the difference in sanitary standard .
achieving consensus would avoid an adverse impact on the european agricultural sector .
many people are very concerned about this proposed free trade agreement .
there are issue , largely concerning seal and tar sand .
therefore , we should be specific in our negotiation here .
i am asking you to take this issue seriously .
reciprocity stand at the core of balanced trade and economic relation .
wonderful people , wonderful achievement - an important partner for the eu .
however , we must be able to ask question of a good partner .
the tar sand represent just one example of incredible environmental destruction .
a you know , the negotiation are making good progress .
consumer will gain through more affordable purchase and enhanced access to high-quality service .
our very debate tonight allows for important clarification to be made .
the vote will take place on wednesday at 12:00 .
canada is even one of the eu 's oldest trading partner .
clearly , the aim of the agreement must be fair competition .
can the commission provide more information in these area ?
canada is one of europe 's oldest trade partner .
i do wonder , however , about the content of several negotiating chapter .
firstly , the eu and canada have different rule of origin system .
the next item is one-minute speech on matter of political importance .
the exasperated greek have taken the baton from the spaniard .
this is a very serious political development with unforeseeable dimension and implication .
in 2016 , the nation hosting the contest will be poland and spain .
now we would like to create a modern programme based on these root .
i am therefore entitled to point out the weakness .
lack of transparency and accusation of corruption are also affecting romanian football .
this further highlight the undue haste with which the german authority acted .
the european authority therefore need to take action on two front .
more than two-thirds of this interest will go to the european union itself .
this is the meaning of the much-vaunted european solidarity .
it is the pacemaker , then , for holder of bad financial asset .
double standard are also applied with regard to war crime and restitution .
brussels could not care le about turkey 's armenian genocide .
i wonder whether this is the tip of the iceberg .
clear and specific answer need to be given to these message .
in addition , policy maker are constantly making disparaging remark about the medium .
i am calling publicly on our high representative , catherine ashton .
young people have been on the receiving end of their vicious attack .
they have correctly raised the call for true democracy .
15 june promise to be an important day of struggle across europe .
big protest should be organised right across europe against austerity on that day .
therefore , any rumour and any recommendation are legally incorrect .
i think this present a unique opportunity to make improvement here .
the first is that the reliance on rating must be reduced .
it will also help to enable unsolicited rating to be given .
however , i am sure that there are also other option .
that is the model that essentially work throughout the world .
the last , but important , point is that we must introduce liability .
this would carry out an in-depth analysis of the current obstacle .
at the moment , romania 's rating ha a stable outlook .
today , this is particularly affecting country that have relatively weak economy .
the amending regulation became effective on 1 june 2011 .
we will pay very close attention to the correct application of this legislation .
nowadays , the european regulatory framework is a model for other jurisdiction .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 7 june at 12:00 .
what effect do they have on the european budget ?
in term of it content , the report is divided into four section .
firstly , there are general requirement for impact assessment at european level .
i hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote .
their bad reputation is partly explained by the risk of manipulation .
we may request them in the light of public opinion .
it wa so unusable that we regretted having spent taxpayer ' money .
the problem gradually became clear to me , too .
i do not have the correct list of speaker , either .
the display board is also still showing the klinz report .
that is presumably why some member were a little irritated .
just one element of these cost is , of course , eu over-regulation .
this is a staggering burden on business and on consumer .
first of all , i think that this is an important proposal .
this impact assessment is important to u for two reason .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 7 june at 12:00 .
i therefore took a very critical approach to the drafting of this report .
the problem is , however , that it can not be enforced .
i am very glad that parliament rejected this directive .
therefore , i personally support mr falbr and his report .
the european union must promote the european social model .
both side have committed to work and develop thing in this area .
parliament always like to help the commission , m reding .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 7 june at 12:00 .
the committee on development wa unanimous in supporting the following key principle .
the oda quota must be even stricter than in the current dci .
think of what that could do in the developing world .
this will help reduce dependence on external aid and boost domestic economic growth .
the greatest gift that we can give is not money .
i am pleased to see that we agree on the majority of issue .
in conclusion , the commission welcome parliament 's report .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 7 june at 12:00 .
progress towards a european contract law for consumer and business ( short presentation )
unfortunately , entrepreneur face a series of other pitfall .
there are significant difference in tax regime and accounting standard .
that mean they miss out on the possibility of utilising the internal market .
well , they do not reap the benefit of the internal market either .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 8 june at 12:00 .
we have an eu-wide school drop-out rate of over 14 % .
the participation of woman in gainful employment is still very low .
many people with disability , a well a migrant , are without job .
it is therefore an absolutely key aspect that we must pursue .
the second major area is , of course , that of further training .
there is currently a very low level of participation in further training initiative .
for that reason , we clearly need to create flexible opportunity in future .
we could almost say that no one ha noticed this .
lifelong learning is vital if unemployment is to be prevented .
we must give due consideration to the different career path .
we call on member state to simplify the procedure for recognising qualification .
high-quality vocational education and training fundamentally contribute to sustainable development .
i welcome the report on european cooperation in vocational education and training .
social background must not determine a person 's educational opportunity .
text of agreement forwarded by the council : see minute
ehec outbreak in the eu member state ( debate )
sporadic case are reported in 11 other member state .
switzerland ha also reported 15 case and the united state 4 .
so what is the european commission doing to tackle the outbreak ?
first , we have immediately activated all our network responsible for managing crisis .
patient questionnaire for outbreak investigation are being collected and compared by the ecdc .
this advice is now available in all official language on the commission website .
finally , let me stress that public perception is extremely important .
we need to learn lesson a we go along .
before closing , i would like to raise briefly two more point .
the first concern reference to ban on certain product .
medical personnel in northern germany are really at their limit .
of course , we still have to find the source .
there have been a few problem in connection with the crisis management .
is it about our farming practice , a peter liese just mentioned ?
is it about intensive farming , hot-housing fruit and vegetable ?
i hope they will listen to this debate in the future .
'business a usual ' is not going to be good enough .
in this case , the precautionary principle must prevail .
you must always learn from the lesson of your mistake .
there is something of a discrepancy between scientific finding and political action .
i think that would be the appropriate thing to do .
i am extremely grateful to mr liese for mentioning the antibiotic problem .
the federal government in germany completely failed in connection with the ehec epidemic .
the monitoring authority were not prepared for this situation .
however , agricultural producer should also be protected against incalculable financial risk .
they have failed to coordinate or to manage the situation .
thirdly , the injured party are entitled to rapid financial compensation .
clearly , our thought are very much with them this morning .
we have a great deal which need to be explained .
i agree with those who have just spoken about this .
it take too long for clear guideline to be issued .
europe must be involved here at an earlier stage .
mr president , first it wa cucumber , yesterday it wa bean sprout .
there is an unnatural combination of strain and dna in the virus .
the fact is , the alert system worked very well .
bacteria circulate more quickly today than they did in the past .
it should be extended to a larger number of foodstuff .
this situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable .
there are several lesson we need to learn from this .
i also think that the communication on this matter ha been chaotic .
fact about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way .
that ha already been said by other member here .
let me also point out the responsibility of the medium .
did this outbreak start in germany or some other member state ?
rumour can be destructive and can even help spread an outbreak .
there are still many unanswered question surrounding this outbreak .
to date , we have 22 death in the eu .
above all , we need to be calm and measured in our response .
the same can not be said of the german authority .
cucumber from spain and other country did have ehec bacteria on them .
for me , that is not the point , either .
you can also look that up easily in the legislation .
for me , the important question is what will happen in future ?
in the future , we need to consider whether slurry use can continue .
could there still be production method that are unacceptable ?
all necessary resource must be made available to our research institute and hospital .
rapid action ha been the order of the day since this pathogen emerged .
blameless , regionally-produced product , too , are no longer selling .
in austria alone , sale of fresh vegetable have fallen by 75 % .
consumer have the right to know where product come from .
this applies equally to shop shelf and to restaurant and catering .
why did the commission echo the hurried information from germany ?
i think that this need to be looked at .
intensive care bed are running out , and blood plasma is needed urgently .
the people of my home area fear new case every day .
various foodstuff have been analysed , but it ha not been found .
nor would it appear that the commission ha coordinated this crisis very well .
commissioner , neither cucumber or soya are the cause .
a mr liese ha said , the cause is the pathogen .
and i ask for the control system to be reviewed .
and i ask her for le arrogance and more diligence .
and that she be held responsible for the damage she ha caused .
she can not ignore the fact that hamburg is in her country .
i agree with you that the technical side of the story ha worked .
rapid alert , tracking and tracing have all worked .
that can not be the european union 's intention .
( sk ) mr president , commissioner , i welcome this debate .
we need to be ready for situation which are even more dangerous .
lady and gentleman , spanish cucumber were not contaminated .
i am telling you , commissioner : know no frontier !
this is what you will be discussing this afternoon .
still , farmer are waiting for the compensation they deserve .
consumer demand food that is of good quality , safe and traceable .
we must also urge calm in such a situation .
can i also say that this house constantly rush to introduce regulation .
furthermore , we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victim .
yet nobody in germany ha resigned or offered reparation for the damage caused .
it is germany that ha a serious credibility problem .
someone said that mr merkel wa a disciple of adenauer and kohl .
she is nothing of the sort : she lack moral fibre .
at any rate , there wa certainly a lack of communication .
that should therefore be the focus of our attention .
in this case , they have left much to be desired .
too many authority are involved , and somebody need to take the lead .
to sum up , there need to be clarity and drive .
first of all , our sympathy , clearly , go to the victim .
in the united state , they have an early-warning system to that end .
people have to be told where this bacterium is .
we did not manage to prevent panic this time .
every day , vegetable producer incur loss of pln 2 million .
several month ago , we raised the alarm concerning swine flu .
because of this , the crisis ha turned into hysteria .
the bond of trust between consumer and producer ha once again been broken .
the commission immediately asked the ecdc to carry out a scientific assessment .
i think this aspect of situation management is very important .
the same go for checking and controlling the information that is circulating .
a regard information , we are supplying continuous information a we receive it .
we will study what happened , and undertake closer investigation and analysis .
the eu can not neglect it farmer in this situation .
we also need to see clear action from body of a pan-european nature .
let u therefore also tackle it in a european context .
research into the source of the e coli outbreak is proving complicated .
we have undermined the confidence of european and other consumer .
we have created a rupture in our trade relation and in internal cohesion .
it is no longer enough to say who and what is to blame .
firstly , european consumer must be able to know what they are eating .
europe must therefore unite in support of proper compensation measure .
the information being received from vegetable producer is disturbing .
this epidemic will also result in victim and enormous financial loss .
question are also being raised about the mistake made by member state .
indeed , we must now turn our thought primarily to the victim .
to what extent do we need better labelling and tracing ?
this give the government control option in order to improve mobility .
it is also to be applied to the entire motorway network .
to conclude , the eurovignette is no miracle solution .
we know that parliament agrees with u on this matter .
we have worked very hard together to reach the compromise .
the last open question of the negotiation wa related to the correlation table .
therefore , we welcome the agreement reached between these two institution .
the hungarian presidency skilfully negotiated with a very narrow majority in the council .
let me thank , in particular , the rapporteur , mr el khadraoui .
i look forward to parliament adopting this directive for two main reason .
i have noted your declaration on the correlation table .
on behalf of the commission , i will also make a formal statement :
that will mean that total toll level remain the same .
hopefully , that is a first step towards further earmarking of this money .
the most important and trickiest point , for me , wa earmarking .
what will the member state use the income from these charge for ?
will they use them to make their transport economy more efficient ?
are we going to oblige them to do so ?
we thus did not achieve what we were hoping for in this regard .
this principle and the tax should be implemented in all member state .
let u hope for some willingness on the part of the member state .
there is something that i would like to clear up .
i do not believe that such a level playing field will result .
it could be that i have misunderstood you in this regard .
it wa not easy to reach a compromise on this issue .
for u , that wa one of the most important point .
making transport more expensive doe not make it more efficient .
we are also putting an emphasis on environmentally friendly good vehicle .
we have had this debate so many time in this house .
first of all , we have the principle of external cost .
what we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise .
that is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied .
this parliament talk of a single system among the member state .
that could have been an ideal opportunity to reach a comprehensive agreement .
the commission must provide impetus on this issue a well .
the question is : how will the money be spent ?
i think this is something which really is controversial .
the tax privilege that heavy good vehicle enjoy are not being curtailed .
we have had a mandatory rail toll within the european union for decade .
this eurovignette is only a tiny step forward towards that goal .
those plan fit in well with today 's agreement .
agriculture , after all , currently ha it sprinkler wide open .
the industry ha been declining steadily over the last decade .
foreign lorry now control 80 % of cross-channel business .
that is something which is not being mentioned and promoted and researched enough .
it is no exaggeration to talk about slave of the road .
in that sense , it is a bad name .
this is much bigger and more complicated than it look .
the 'user pay ' and 'polluter pay ' principle will inevitably continue .
the second fight is much more continuous and sharper .
this wa also very visible here during the debate .
i sincerely ask you to please support this compromise .
this issue ha been up in the air for year and year .
thank you also for the appreciation expressed to the hungarian presidency .
a with every other compromise , a serious balancing act wa carried out .
had it not been important , this directive would not exist .
i would like to mention three specific issue which attracted several question .
that promise heated discussion over the next few year .
these are thing for the forthcoming year , however .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
appointment of a member of the court of auditor ( h.g.wessberg-sv ) (
request for the waiver of agnes hankiss 's parliamentary immunity (
i would like to thank you for that in advance .
seventh eu programme for research , technological development and demonstration (
no problem have been found with the ethical aspect of the project .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i therefore voted in favour of this proposal for a european parliament decision .
i wish him all the best in his new role .
this is the basis of the current article 8 .
the central district court of buda opened renewed proceeding on 31 march 2010 .
ágnes hankiss can be tried without her parliamentary activity being called into question .
the rapporteur ha also found no evidence of fumus persecutionis .
when it come to resolving anachronism , i am all for it .
this should improve the overall cohesion of the legislative environment in this area .
we aim to create a better , clearer legislative environment for business .
for the reason given above , i voted in favour of the report .
however , import control measure on textile product must be maintained .
i therefore believe that it immediate involvement is essential .
drug are one of the major scourge of our society today .
that is why i am voting for this recommendation .
there ha been a steady increase in the quantity of drug seized .
training of police officer and provision of the necessary equipment have continued .
croatia remains one of the main trafficking route for drug to the eu .
croatia applied in 2005 , and the negotiation were successfully concluded in 2009 .
croatia ha asked to participate in it since 2005 .
significant and large-scale cocaine seizure in croatia are mostly connected with sea transport .
the scourge of drug continues to cause concern throughout the eu .
croatia aim to become a full member of the european union .
these were positively concluded in july 2009 with the initialling of the agreement .
in writing . - we supported the mandate of emcdda in 2006 .
significant and large-scale cocaine seizure in croatia are mostly connected with sea transport .
in 2008 , the total number of reported drug-related offence wa 7 168 .
nevertheless , this is an issue for domestic legislation , not the agreement .
for it part , the commission should ensure adequate level of funding .
europe 's current market share of 25 % is below expectation .
these system are used everywhere , today , in every form of transport .
they are estimated at around eur 800 million per year .
these project will make everyday life easier from now on .
all these area will be improved by the creation of this european service .
this is the case in general , and in this sector in particular .
this is a strategic requirement for a real single european sky .
europe 's current market share of 25 % is below expectation .
egnos is ten time more accurate than gps at present .
this is an area , moreover , that ha seen massive development .
for these reason , i voted for this report .
in writing . - i voted in favour of this report .
europe 's current market share of 25 % is below expectation .
the economic growth of this region enhances the value of such agreement .
this benefit all party : passenger , freight operator and airline .
i voted in favour of this report for two main reason .
this report relates to international air agreement under the treaty of lisbon .
in the past , parliament wa merely consulted on such agreement .
parliament therefore need to follow the process from the outset .
regulatory convergence can do much to promote fair competition .
this implies a corresponding responsibility to monitor how negotiation are conducted more closely .
above all , such agreement guarantee the same right to all union airline .
previously , it wa only necessary to consult parliament about these agreement .
this implies a corresponding responsibility to monitor how negotiation are conducted more closely .
previously , parliament had only been consulted on such agreement .
i therefore voted in favour of saïd el khadraoui 's report .
in the uk , we do not currently subscribe to the eurovignette scheme .
these charge are a step forward , but they are not enough .
this divestment tends to increase following process of liberalisation and privatisation .
moreover , the road haulage sector employ over 30 000 people in ireland .
this report deserves credit for demanding accountability from member state .
this is a good thing since these irresponsible practice must cease .
secondly , for demanding accountability on the revenue generated by the eurovignette .
these revenue must be exclusively destined for environmental policy .
furthermore , a toll may significantly reduce the demand for road transport .
the proposed amendment are the result of consultation with the political group .
these objective were confirmed by the council 's position .
for these reason , i voted against this report .
implementing the external cost of transport is a step in the right direction .
in writing . - i abstained on the eurovignette vote today .
freight transportation and hard working lorry driver have become synonymous with our country .
the problem is much greater than the report suggests .
environmental economic account provide a significant database for environmental policy decision .
the environmental account show the interaction between business , household and environmental factor .
consequently , mandatory data collection by member state is necessary .
i welcome mr leinen 's proposal and voted in favour of it .
such information will be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
these link help politician to take better decision in the public interest .
it is vital that we bequeath a healthy environment to future generation .
such information could be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
such information could be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
mandatory data collection by the member state is therefore necessary .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
such information could be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
mandatory data collection by the member state is therefore necessary .
such information could be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
the delegation of power to the commission is also heading in this direction .
and yet i am voting in favour of it .
such information could be extremely valuable for the purpose of environmental policy making .
i agree with the rapporteur 's position and i voted in favour .
however , the binding nature of this system creates an additional administrative burden .
the implementation of the function mentioned requires sufficient human and financial resource .
for these reason , i voted for this report .
the environmental account are intended to only show the interaction .
the citizen must be informed of environmental impact resulting from economic activity .
i voted in favour of the report by mr leinen .
( the sitting wa suspended at 13:15 and resumed at 15:00 )
lady and gentleman , i would like to make the following announcement .
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
the next item is question hour with the president of the commission .
mr president , my thanks for your assessment of the situation .
president of the commission . - there is an ongoing debate about this .
not all meps are back in the chamber after the fire drill .
regarding the esm , we are now in the process of establishing it .
regarding eurobonds , this is not a new idea .
it is fair to recognise that these issue are extremely difficult and complex .
that is why they are rejecting it , which could be extremely risky .
could not europe also lend greece a hand on this matter ?
we are currently addressing the issue of banking secrecy .
mr barroso , i have just one brief question .
we are aware of how sensitive this area is .
is there any more you can tell u in this connection ?
is this a one-off , or will there be further discussion ?
will you be putting this on the agenda again ?
we think it contributes hugely to knowledge and freedom .
however , there wa not really any negotiation in term of specific result .
president of the commission . - no , i do not accept that .
unfortunately , your criticism of the euro area is always ideological .
one other question i have is about cathy ashton .
i note her attendance at commission meeting is very low .
is the uk being correctly represented at the commission ?
president of the commission . - there are two question here .
mr president , my apology for the delay in my arrival .
2008 wa the year of a deep crisis in banking .
i think you will like the document we adopted today .
however , i think we are agreed on the goal .
we will , of course , be making substantial proposal in this area .
the commission say implementation of anti-corruption instrument is unsatisfactory .
that wa the angle taken on the issue at the last g8 meeting .
that ha been our consistent position and we will maintain it .
here , we may have completely different point of view .
you mentioned conditionality , which is what my question relates to .
the reality is that there wa no agreement between the member state .
i think that is where we should now concentrate our effort .
that is , of course , a very important and decisive one .
however , there were different reaction to the detail of this new vision .
what concrete measure is the eu planning in this respect ?
honourable member , what you said reflects my own thought precisely .
all this is being pursued for the benefit of society and the public .
i understand how difficult these time are for greece .
but , at the same time , let u be honest .
it is a crisis , and we all know it is a crisis .
a the previous speaker mentioned , many member state are concerned .
we had issue in madrid recently when people were protesting on the street .
but we know that greece ha no intention of leaving the eurozone .
iceland is not a member of the eurozone and iceland went bankrupt .
the question hour with the president of the commission is closed .
i think mr piebalgs is standing in for her .
but the positive momentum of the immediate post-referendum period ha vanished .
there are worrying tendency towards increased tension and conflict .
our utmost concern would be to avoid state failure .
north sudan , on the other hand , will suffer some loss .
a lasting peace in darfur can not be achieved without justice and reconciliation .
people were happy because for once , they were having their say .
the viability and stability of both north and south are crucial .
the situation in abyei is becoming worse every day .
mr piebalgs , i had prepared a three-minute speech .
in fact , you covered all the most important point .
at the same time , it is exciting and wonderful .
i think that in this respect , you have fulfilled their request .
sudan is once again facing a major historical turning point .
we need to build capacity from the bottom up .
there are two other factor to mention , too .
is south sudan to be given a fair start ?
if not , how can we in europe help ?
the northern army ha occupied abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight .
i hope , therefore , for european pressure on al-bashir .
this is what ha produced the disaster that sudan ha become .
this also call for attention from the international community .
( nl ) madam president , the glorious date of 9 july approach .
in the abyei region , he ha started to massacre citizen .
the ethnic cleansing of the southern ngok dinka people seems to have begun .
the life of united nation staff there are not safe .
there were differing view on the continuing risk of violent clash .
now , the situation in sudan is making the headline again .
both sudan and south sudan have enormous humanitarian need to deal with .
the life of million of people still depend on outside aid .
however , the next few month will remain critical .
south sudan must be enabled to establish itself a a viable sovereign state .
however , south sudan also need the eu 's unequivocal support politically .
however , a you are aware , the situation ha deteriorated drastically recently .
it wa to mean the creation of a 54th state in africa .
the abyei region of sudan ha been riven by conflict for many year .
will the country remain at peace or will it sink into another war ?
when considering the most recent escalation , this should not be forgotten .
it is a country in which the men have not learned to work .
now we see a light at the end of the tunnel .
we never compromised on human right or international criminal court issue .
this take time and the abyei issue certainly did not help .
the vote will take place on thursday , 9 june , at 12:00 .
application of schengen acquis in bulgaria and romania ( debate )
unfortunately , the council ha failed to respect parliament once again .
my sixth and final point is that they have worked hard .
this ha been a consistently high priority for the hungarian presidency .
the hungarian presidency ha made considerable effort to take this dossier forward .
we need more europe on this , and not le europe .
i now add that we must help bulgaria and romania .
congratulation once again , mr coelho , and congratulation to romania and bulgaria .
the answer according to the rule is 'yes ' .
i am pleased that our viewpoint won the day .
institutional cooperation must be fair , logical and democratic .
i understand the concern about corruption and organised crime .
a dangerous game is being played with bulgaria and romania here .
overall , the opinion on the table is a positive one .
that is not something that we want in either romania or bulgaria .
( nl ) mr president , i will get straight to the point .
it is naive , in fact , it is childishly naive .
the fact just do not back the idea up .
yet we are supposed to allow these country into schengen ?
the fact just do not back this idea up , either .
both country also have worryingly high score when it come to human trafficking .
yet we are supposed to allow these country into schengen ?
it would be an outrage , and completely irresponsible .
bulgaria and romania are absolutely not ready for schengen .
they are not ready now , and they never will be .
i also thank the presidency and commission for their support on this report .
what guarantee is the commission giving that this problem will be tackled effectively ?
romania and the agency frontex have strengthened their partnership .
we can not allow political argument to delay the enlargement .
in summary , this proposal is simply a border too far .
europe want to do organised crime an enormous favour .
the schengen area should therefore be consolidated and strengthened further .
well done again to mr coelho on his report .
our rapporteur also performed a review on the ground .
he carried out an objective evaluation and reached the same conclusion .
the schengen area is also an area of confidence , however .
the abolition of internal border control is an enormous success of european integration .
the condition set in the union are the same for everyone .
europe ha problem with the rising number of emigrant .
up till now , we have been talking mainly about the economic crisis .
we have to show that we know how to overcome crisis .
however , a further step now ha to be taken .
it is a matter of doing this a quickly a possible .
mr president , today , the schengen arrangement are coming under strong pressure .
it will boost european ' confidence in the schengen area .
there ha been no consultation about this with the union .
the criterion and the measure for securing the external border are not simple .
first and foremost , there is a message for the council of minister .
a strong message will also be sent to bulgarian and romanian citizen .
i am confident that the council can heed positive effort .
europe is definitely more different nowadays to the europe of 20 year ago .
this should not come a a surprise to anyone .
let u remember therefore that huge group of illegal immigrant are crossing ...
obviously , problem should not be shifted to area where there are none .
corruption and crime are prevalent in all european union member state .
bulgaria and romania proved that they can work for a united europe .
they entered the judicial contract and fulfilled all it criterion .
we also need to fight against corruption and to increase the fight .
some of you were kind enough to refer to this .
they are very clear , they are very transparent .
several comment have been made in this debate that aptly demonstrate this .
if they do meet them , then they should enter .
the people of bulgaria and romania should not become hostage to populist rhetoric .
these are different process , and each ha it own pace .
thank you for reminding u of that and for making that nice mention .
the vote will take place on 8 june 2011 .
all the shortcoming identified in the past have been rectified .
organised criminal gang , increasingly multi-ethnic , act with extreme violence .
we have a duty to our citizen to take europol 's warning seriously .
it therefore need urgent repair before it is extended .
it is a european political problem of a strategic character .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
the next item is question time ( b7-0407/2011 ) .
in february 2011 , the commission registered it 1 000th quality food name .
why doe the commission think there are such disparity between member state ?
how can the registration process be made more user-friendly ?
can the commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food scheme ?
this explains why there are many registered name in certain member state .
the procedure for registering a name generally take several year .
if there are no objection , the name may be registered .
this procedure explains the time required for registration to take place .
the commission is aware of the need to speed up the registration procedure .
the entire fruit and vegetable sector is on it knee .
the economic crisis ha devastated employment level among young graduate .
and in spain , it is more than 40 % .
in italy , 76 % of youngster say they are going to emigrate .
the commission 's main objective is to have a preventive approach .
the spirit of schengen is a spirit of trust and solidarity .
we can also show solidarity by showing financial solidarity .
others will hopefully be offered in the future a well .
( el ) commissioner , thank you very much .
i absolutely agree with you , a - i believe - doe parliament .
yes , we want to keep building up trust .
you also commented on the question of the new mechanism .
hopefully , that should allow u to increase the trust .
there must also be progress at the municipal level .
( de ) many thanks , commissioner , for a very good answer .
it is certainly completely counterproductive to 'imprison ' the populace there .
the timing is very much in the hand of kosovo 's government .
we can come whenever they call and whenever reasonable progress ha been made .
subject : countering the use of the internet by criminal
member of the commission . - cybercrime is indeed a growing menace .
we have the european digital agenda and the european internal security strategy .
the european union need to enhance it strategy for combating cybercrime .
you can be assured that we follow this very closely .
is it willing to take measure further to strengthen external eu border ?
we are also planning to follow a parallel approach .
the basis of our work need to be the existing legislation .
this can be done by issuing guideline or recommendation .
we look very seriously upon all report of the suspension of schengen .
we need to have more tool at our disposal to assist member state .
so that is not the solution to the greek problem .
subject : future of the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf )
there is therefore no doubt that it need to be made sustainable .
a large part of that time is taken up by assessing the application .
at present , there are several option on the table .
for instance , the fund could be part of the european social fund .
we simply wished to draw your attention to two particular problem .
we have specific aim to pursue and we need these resource .
perhaps you could put a supplementary to another question ?
that show that they respect the principle of subsidiarity .
the charter of fundamental right of the european union back up my opinion .
i trust that i have answered the question satisfactorily .
you gave me more or le the same reply to my written question .
is it greece 's , portugal 's and ireland 's lender ?
we will continue this discussion and hopefully find the right answer .
parliament is currently drafting a report on promoting professional mobility in the eu .
the situation ha been highlighted on several occasion recently .
member of the commission . - this is a very topical question .
subject : reallocation of financial resource in the regional and cohesion fund
mr martin , thank you very much for the question .
it is just that none of it is what is at issue .
i am sure you have experience in this area .
mr martin , i did read your question very carefully .
subject : fulfilment of the objective of structural fund payment
several programme have also failed to achieve their objective .
this wa the same finding a in previous year .
how doe the commission intend to remedy this situation ?
mr jensen , thank you very much for your question .
the annual allocation must not exceed this upper limit .
around 70 % of the error rate occurs in this area .
parliament ha drafted a proposal that is defined by consensus and collaboration .
we can no longer carry on making more europe with a smaller budget .
we firmly believe in the efficacy of eu expenditure .
we call on the european commission to make this a reality .
( the speaker broke off , hoping to continue his speech later )
this is a concept that some people will support .
( de ) mr hartong , of course i recognise this right .
i suppose that this represents some sort of progress .
in the u , there are 28 000 diplomat .
around 44 000 people are responsible for monetary policy in the european union .
in the u , there are 18 000 in the federal reserve board .
that would make enormous saving in it research budget .
i would like to congratulate the committee on it work .
we want own resource in order to reduce pressure on national budget .
it is logical and it requires a logical and rational response from london .
the united kingdom government is asking for better spending , not more spending .
the third priority concern the eu 's own resource .
take , for example , our diplomatic service , our embassy abroad .
the current budget is too much 'business a usual ' .
we have the 2020 objective for a smart economy , a sustainable economy .
the eu must invest in this so that we can deal with it .
that is the innovation we should be talking about .
for that , too , we need european money .
the third priority concern the eu 's own resource .
naturally , this involves an important part of financial market regulation .
taxpayer ' money wa wasted and we should not repeat this mistake .
however it seems it coalition meps here favour a freeze .
taxpayer in the uk will not be thanking them .
we shall not see them lit again in our time ' .
what terrible intellectual , cultural and political poverty pervades this report !
what a tendency towards dictatorship by the european political elite .
you are therefore demanding a minimum 5 % increase in the eu budget .
it is a genuine european perspective on the future of the european project .
yes , we share the vision which is contained in the report .
that wa a very important discussion between the commission and parliament .
( in response to a voice from the floor : )
it establishes that member state must honour their own commitment .
we want sustainable , integrated urban development and we want a well-educated workforce .
a lack of cohesion is bad news , even for strong national economy .
for this reason , we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy .
the skill and experience of woman must be utilised .
other institution could have a little more of this spirit .
we want to have genuine own resource , a described in the treaty .
growth is the basis for economic and social activity .
this is required if we are to be honest with our citizen .
we need to deal with increased globalisation and competition .
major cross-border investment in research , for example , will be needed .
it effect can be seen more clearly in poland than anywhere else .
i do not consider this to be a true alternative .
thus , what we need is openness to reform and political courage .
this will make the european union stronger and our financing system more transparent .
naturally , we can not just drop one element and add another .
we need money for this and for broadband network in rural area .
what we do here is not a waste of money .
naturally , we are on your side on this issue .
this wa recognised by the founding state after the second world war .
we should work on developing this , not destroying it .
the answer , in my opinion , is no it can not .
it will therefore be regarded a being of value to european unity .
it ha been dominated by discussion on how much political decision will cost .
it is something of which we can be proud .
best of all , it wa always cheerful and open .
our report contains 174 paragraph , all of them argument for more europe .
i would also like to thank the commission for it very active role .
the result is a cake that give them belly ache .
i am afraid the same will happen with our budget framework .
we are well aware of how badly the lisbon strategy turned out .
for these reason , i can not back the report .
i should like to welcome the representative of the united nation .
those are the basic reason why i can not possibly support this report .
the european council recently adopted ambitious target for the eu 's development .
i wish to congratulate the rapporteur , salvador garriga .
they were not in favour in economic boom time either .
however , more money is being sought for research and development .
this reflects very well the debate on the multiannual budget .
some money ha to be returned to member state .
it is not possible to contribute le but receive more .
austerity champion at home , big spender in brussels .
however , it can not be divorced from the reality of it citizen .
it can only be met by raising tax , cutting service , school ...
secondly : what budget is required by a currency union ?
thirdly : what potential is open to u to make saving ?
fourthly : what budget is required by the united state of europe ?
fifthly : what role is europe 2020 to play ?
do we want to play a role at all ?
we , the european parliament , take our responsibility seriously .
more europe will also create a potential for saving in the member state .
financial resource are only a mean of achieving the objective .
these cut are part of effort to exit the crisis .
it doe contain reserve and they need to be requested .
it includes everything that is necessary and positive for europe 's future .
it will perhaps not be possible to deal with both .
that doe not bode well for the future , lady and gentleman .
unfortunately , this report proposes none of these thing .
they will also need their own additional budget in the forthcoming financial period
secondly , commit the cohesion fund to the genuinely poor region in europe .
bon appetit , but be careful you do not choke on it .
this is an ambitious report , whilst simultaneously being a realistic report .
it will be the guide for the next financial perspective .
cohesion policy is also the result of the solidarity principle .
there are three area for amendment which i would plead in favour of .
firstly , in the longer term , we need a five-year financial perspective .
overall , this request from parliament is absolutely justified .
the way i see it , this is an invitation to waste money .
we therefore need to drop paragraph 73 from the report .
mr pieper , can you explain why it is a dream ?
this put it at odds with the narrow vision of most member state .
there are always those task and challenge that are more important than others .
this is not a conflict between the eu and the member state .
this is an ongoing struggle for leadership and priority .
we need to set priority and not solve problem just by increasing budget .
by 2050 , that figure will be 5 % or 6 % .
in 2100 , we will make up 3 % of that population .
all of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage .
europe manages 2.5 % or one-fortieth of total budgetary expenditure in europe .
the member state ' contribution make up one-fortieth of their national spending .
let u now consider the question of own resource or maybe another time .
in view of these reality , mr garriga polledo 's report is modest .
that is why this house should adopt the report .
the report recognises the valuable role played by this fund .
the increase in the multiannual financial framework is necessary .
what is more , two key union policy are given their rightful place .
it facilitates demand to freeze or to reduce eu spending .
the commission 's official have up to 13 week paid leave .
neither one nor the other can operate without each other .
of course , this will require major investment , particularly in research .
how ha it been able to continue for so long ?
secondly , we must , of course , also review expense .
we believe that these are the most important suggestion .
well , we must be thankful for small mercy .
( pl ) mr president , we have achieved an important consensus .
the common agricultural policy benefit every consumer in the eu .
'yes ' to special measure for island and mountainous area in europe .
( the sitting wa suspended for a few moment )
i must stress the need for the eu to respond to demographic challenge .
i fully support the creation of an intermediate region category .
this would serve to create a better balance between region .
let u look at the current multiannual financial framework ( mff ) .
once again , this is threatening the heralded principle of cohesion .
like all transformation , the emerging order will produce winner and loser .
jean monnet warned in his time : 'europe ha never existed .
we need better , simpler legislation which serf the interest of european .
it is time the eu and it budget were reformed .
their reluctance to increase the eu budget is quite understandable .
european integration ha a positive and stimulating influence on the economy .
freezing the resource by member state will not be a sustainable option .
a true financial perspective ha to look even further forward than seven year .
however , i support flexible mechanism for necessary adaptation .
there is therefore no better alternative than the one we are discussing today .
demanding budget increase in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous .
instead , we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make saving .
firstly , on cohesion policy , which is key to regional development .
meps have also given their due attention to europe 's research effort .
in my opinion , parliament ha already taken a stand in this question .
the galliga polledo report devotes much attention to the europe 2020 programme .
it is therefore important for it funding to be increased .
i already asked for it to be repaired yesterday .
i would ask for the service of a technician please .
seventh eu programme for research , technological development and demonstration (
cooperation in vocational education and training to support the europe 2020 strategy (
progress towards a european contract law for consumer and business (
gdp and beyond - measuring progress in a changing world (
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
this wa the result of compromise being made and which received willing support .
this will ensure that we will be le competitive .
most of these business will be unable to sustain higher cost .
mr president , the eurovignette proposal is well intentioned .
the high cost of diesel ha pushed haulier to the brink .
regrettably , i had to vote against the measure .
gross domestic product is an indicator of economic development and prosperity .
thus , all of this can only supplement gdp figure .
for that reason , i voted against the report .
all of this creates pointless bureaucracy that frightens industry away .
it prevents europe from progressing from idea to invoice .
parliament ha today shown that it ha the will to do this .
now it is up to the commission to show the way .
we have to increase funding to achieve vital growth in europe .
this need to be cut , so that thing can be prioritised properly .
we were very pleased to welcome the introduction of the risk-sharing finance facility .
for these reason , i voted in favour of the report .
( pl ) mr president , i voted against the audy report .
however , the demand for sector-specific analysis come up again and again .
the impact assessment for the eu-canada agreement indicates clear benefit for both side .
it is our responsibility to do what is best for the majority .
for me , bilateral agreement are always the second best option .
however , i think some politician have forgotten what csr stand for .
responsible entrepreneurship is always the backbone of competitiveness and successful business .
the projection suggest that the demand for skill will continue to rise .
it is also behind the unrest in the southern mediterranean country .
we must concentrate more on vocational training and retraining .
they are not putting their money where their mouth is .
there is no point arguing about that : saving will be made .
saving will be made and we have to make them .
for it part , the european parliament ha been consulted .
romania and bulgaria adopted the schengen acquis when joining the eu in 2007 .
these country should become full member of the schengen area .
i am therefore voting for this report , and would congratulate the rapporteur .
our border have been ready for some time to defend europe 's border .
free movement is one of the union 's greatest achievement .
bulgaria will have to implement transitional measure when it enters schengen .
these issue are undoubtedly important , but the proposal is purely politically motivated .
adding new criterion would create a two-tier system for the member state .
the european parliament ha spoken today with one voice about fairness .
for how much longer is the council going to continue ignoring our position ?
the schengen agreement wa concluded on 14 june 1985 .
romania and bulgaria adopted the schengen acquis when joining the eu in 2007 .
i have nothing against our friend and neighbour in bulgaria and romania .
however , i do have a number of grievance against the schengen provision .
consequently i fully support their full participation in the schengen area .
i am in favour of romania and bulgaria joining the schengen area .
these issue are undoubtedly important , but the proposal is purely politically motivated .
adding new criterion would create a two-tier system for member state .
romania and bulgaria adopted the schengen acquis when joining the eu in 2007 .
we joined the european union because we wanted to adopt it internal rule .
it is the most sensitive and fragile place in the union .
i voted in favour of admitting romania and bulgaria to the schengen area .
this is one of the greatest achievement of the european integration process .
for these reason , it is important to give this stage broad support .
cooperation is needed on the question of land border management .
there are also problem with corruption and organised crime .
expert have confirmed that the appropriate technical standard have been put in place .
i am also pleased that the report contains safeguard for data protection .
opening the border ha been one of the european union 's greatest achievement .
however , this challenge also concern member state already in the schengen area .
the bulgarian authority undertook to bring about radical improvement .
the uk , of course , remains outside the schengen area .
so far , cooperation wa not exemplary in the un general assembly .
in writing . - i strongly supported the main thrust of this report .
the course of event in japan highlight the need for this partnership .
in this regard , i welcome improving relation with regional organisation .
the attention that the european parliament give the un is most important .
this coordination is also very important in the united nation ( un ) .
these are amendment whose legitimacy we have always contested .
all the abovementioned issue are timely and i voted in favour .
i agree that the un 's role should be strengthened .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
that is why i voted in favour of this excellent report .
the central role played by research in this strategy ha been acknowledged .
the central role played by research in this strategy ha been acknowledged .
the situation could be improved by simplifying the administrative and financial rule .
it ha not been possible to achieve this ambitious goal .
now , however , action must be taken to match their word .
that is why i decided to lend my full support to this report .
paragraph 27 of this report contains information which contradicts the truth .
the commission ha not identified any infringement to date .
it ha a budget allocation of eur 50 billion for the period 2007-2013 .
it is a question of funding from the euratom programme .
we need to focus more on protection against radiation and final storage .
having weighed up the issue , i abstained from voting .
the central role played by research wa acknowledged in this strategy .
this desire wa not realised , for a number of reason .
we must continue to work towards this goal by amending fp7 .
the report doe not cover the issue of iter or of galileo investment .
this is a complete contradiction of the goal of the seventh framework programme .
research and innovation are important for ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth in lithuania .
we must overcome these obstacle if we want to make real progress .
i voted in favour of this resolution on eu-canada trade relation .
this resolution therefore urge the european commission to abandon this approach .
i would like to highlight the issue of market access for agricultural product .
it continues by advocating the successful conclusion of the doha round .
there are more than enough reason to vote against .
nonetheless , progress in wto negotiation must be given priority over bilateral agreement .
clearly , the aim of the ceta must be fair competition .
this ban is not justified , neither scientifically nor legally .
particular attention should be paid to the agricultural sector and consumer .
we must maintain a firm stance on gmos , milk and origin labelling .
we must ensure fair and greater competition among agricultural good supplier .
such a requirement doe not conform with the principle of positive trade relation .
i welcome this european parliament resolution on eu-canada trade relation .
the commission also need to take a strong position to protect the ban .
i voted in favour of mr klinz 's report on credit rating agency .
i urge the commission to respond to our request a soon a possible .
however , it did not solve all the problem .
i voted against the report on credit rating agency .
i am talking about portugal , ireland , greece and spain .
however , what are our thought on their now key role ?
at the same time , we can see the potential problem .
a better knowledge base is a prerequisite for further discussion of this matter .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
the report suggests way of dealing with each of these problem .
we must pay attention to the potential measure to be taken .
we must therefore stay up-to-date with development in the united state .
credit rating agency are supposed to provide information about the quality of credit .
hitherto , however , these agency have earned themselves a dishonourable reputation .
i believe that the activity of credit rating agency are generally extremely dubious .
i welcome this resolution on the future perspective of credit rating agency .
this is why i have voted in favour of the report .
people are not good whose price can be negotiated .
in this regard , it is considered a sensitive and trusted partner .
this must be used to achieve more ambitious goal set by the eu .
this initiative is actually a step in the right direction .
this is a mandatory condition for negotiation with third country .
in this regard , it is considered a sensitive and trusted partner .
this must be used to achieve more ambitious goal set by the eu .
international company are the main player when it come to applying social standard .
on this point , i insist that the commission change it doctrine .
i welcome this report and am voting for it .
for all these reason , we voted against the report .
the fact that worker do not know their right is another important factor .
this aspect is very important in the actual context .
these are several of the reason why i endorse this report .
the overwhelming majority of farm are owned by men .
this is - and should remain - a voluntary matter .
this is a condition without which negotiation with non-member country are impossible .
i also share the opinion on the joint fight to eliminate child labour .
this is a condition without which negotiation with third country are impossible .
i support the principle set down in the report .
should not this also extend to business outside of europe ?
for that reason , i have abstained from voting .
this should be a condition for negotiation with third country .
this is a condition without which negotiation with non-member state are impossible .
there is a growing need for mobile , flexible employee with international experience .
the economic crisis ha turned the european union labour market completely upside down .
i am alarmed by the high youth unemployment rate .
there is a growing need for mobile , flexible employee with international experience .
the eu is experiencing a severe economic , financial and social crisis .
there are currently 22.82 million unemployed people in the european union .
the eu only ha marginal responsibility on these issue .
the projection suggest that the demand for skill will continue to rise .
there is ever-increasing emphasis on a clear , results-orientated learning approach .
reform have already been implemented in vocational education system in some member state .
this is , therefore , one of europe 's most pressing problem .
these must be tackled with concrete , creative and effective measure .
i agree with this report and i voted for it .
learning method should be more flexible and accessible on a lifelong basis .
we need to expand the possibility of acquiring experience abroad for all .
we can not forget that youth unemployment figure are overwhelming throughout europe .
i voted for the report because i agree with it proposal .
it doe not examine the cause in depth , or seek solution .
policy maker must enable people to improve and broaden their skill .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
the world economy requires skill , flexibility , availability and knowledge of language .
in my opinion , this initiative is very important and timely .
the world of work ha undergone some major change .
there are major challenge ahead in europe 's labour market .
worse still , it no longer even offer protection against unemployment .
however , simply calling for action is too vague .
for that reason , i have abstained from voting .
training programme should be oriented to their need and level of ability .
there is a growing need for mobile , flexible employee with international experience .
the labour market increasingly requires mobile , flexible people with international experience .
europe 's worker must be able to adapt to the economy 's requirement .
political decision maker must enable people to upgrade and broaden their skill .
these new job will require worker with high and intermediate level skill .
there is a growing need for mobile , flexible employee with international experience .
people must be given the mean to upgrade and broaden their skill .
problem associated with vocational education and training are becoming a priority for u .
the fight against youth unemployment must be a priority for all european government .
consequently , i voted in favour of the hirsch report .
combating youth unemployment is one of the most important challenge facing the eu .
european cooperation to draft a single policy is needed in this sector .
for all these reason , i supported this particular report .
it is important for vocational training to be accessible to all people .
the europe 2020 strategy should provide for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
a results-based approach is also essential in relation to learning .
moreover , european development aid must be adequately funded .
i welcome what is said on that subject in the report .
development aid must enable the population concerned to remain in their geographical area .
that wa the logic behind my voting for this report .
the evaluation carried out is relevant from several point of view .
the evaluation carried out is relevant from several point of view .
in future , sufficient fund must always be available for eu development cooperation .
a i have already said , nothing justifies a reduction in aid .
official development assistance currently represents more than usd 120 billion .
at present , this is being managed through a variety of programme .
however , the aim of this report is to increase financial aid .
humanitarian principle and the desire for global balance provide plausible ground for this .
i voted in favour of the text presented by mr mitchell .
i voted in favour of this resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessment .
ia can thus make a significant contribution to better law making .
hitherto , however , this procedure ha rarely been applied .
i am convinced that impact assessment would help those who prepare political decision .
impact assessment ( ia ) are a key instrument in the legislative process .
ia can make a significant contribution to better law making .
impact assessment ( ia ) are an instrument central to the legislative process .
in writing . - i voted against the niebler report on impact assessment .
unfortunately , the niebler report fails to meet these criterion .
impact assessment ( ia ) can constitute important support for the legislative process .
there remain numerous question regarding the methodology to be used in each case .
on what or whom will the impact be measured ?
these decision , too , normally depend on political choice and evaluation .
the methodology of some assessment and specialist will be more independent than others .
ia can thus make a significant contribution to better law making .
the second section discus the commission 's ia and highlight scope for improvement .
in writing . - i have several reason why i support this resolution .
only in this way can the legislator do his job efficiently .
the commission also carry out public consultation on it legislative plan .
the european parliament ha so far lacked an impact assessment body .
i supported mr niebler 's report on guaranteeing independent impact assessment .
in writing . - i voted for this report .
ia can thus make a significant contribution to better law making .
they merely permit the technical and substantive preparation of a political decision .
first of all they should be completely independent and transparent .
i welcome this text which condemns the european commission 's partiality .
they therefore make a significant contribution to excellence in law making .
ia can thus make a significant contribution to better law making .
they are a key instrument for the european legislative process .
the draft report divide these evaluation into four section .
ia can thus make a significant contribution to better law making .
they merely permit the technical , substantive preparation of a political decision .
the ia used by the european institution should comply with certain principle .
the policy option listed should also include the option of taking no action .
impact assessment are a key instrument for the legislative process .
they should cover all category of legislative proposal and employ a clear methodology .
i therefore support parliament 's proposed criterion for consideration when ia are undertaken .
ia must be independent and undertaken in a transparent and objective way .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
contract are the fundamental link in relationship between company and consumer .
i am voting for the report tabled on this issue .
it context , however , includes danger for both : consumer & smes .
therefore , we are not voting in favour of the report .
contract law determines and organises transaction in the single market .
the broad and balanced involvement of the participant is of fundamental importance .
in writing . - i voted against this report .
simplicity and readiness for use should be a key objective .
provision on sale of good merit priority , a do service contract .
indeed , such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer right .
it is for that reason that i am voting against this report .
a unified contract law regime must be applied in the european union .
furthermore , it implementation would require additional funding and increased bureaucracy .
i would stress the need for broad and balanced stakeholder involvement .
the immense cost incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier .
i believe smes are crucial for economic recovery in many member state .
however , all option should be kept open and examined at present .
i voted in favour of the text presented by mr wallis .
gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity .
this report emphasis the need to measure the quality of life in society .
for these reason , this report deserves to be given the highest consideration .
gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity .
in particular , it doe not measure environmental sustainability or social integration .
unfortunately , there are only partial sign of coherent action .
i therefore agree with the report 's general objective .
indicator are a concise way of interpreting a given phenomenon .
it is the most widely known and used measure of macro-economic activity .
gdp ha become an indicator of social development and progress generally .
indicator which measure such factor should be assigned a greater role .
i share the rapporteur 's analysis in the report voted on today .
this indicator underpins many of the european union 's policy decision and instrument .
there is often a lack of clearly defined information , data and indicator .
there are also some significant parameter which are interpreted incorrectly .
moreover , in certain case , gdp may provide inaccurate and misleading information .
for example , gdp doe not measure environmental sustainability or social integration .
gross domestic product is the best known measure worldwide .
i hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policy .
nowadays , unfortunately , politician often do not have such information .
the development of eu policy should not be purely based on abstract statistic .
the 'beyond gdp ' method mentioned in this report may prove very useful .
unfortunately , galileo is facing additional delay and cost .
faced with this situation , it is essential that we consider new solution .
i therefore abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report .
to such a proposal , i categorically say no .
the problem is it potential use for military and aggressive end .
the problem is it potential use for military and aggressive end .
i believe that galileo must stay within it current budget .
however , there is also a strategic dimension to galileo .
currently , the financial picture is anything but positive .
nonetheless , galileo offer clear advantage over the gps system .
i fully support the report of vladimir remek and i voted in favour .
the commission 's evaluation is certainly awaited with anticipation .
an attempt is now being made to limit damage by making saving .
for that reason , i have abstained from voting .
in writing . - this ha been a disastrous vote for the green .
this report is therefore of inestimable support to citizen !
i can not support the report by mr garriga polledo .
the report also seek to reduce the amount of arrears by increasing payment .
i congratulate the rapporteur on his work , which i endorsed .
a we know , the budget represents the start of any political act .
if you have no budget , you have no project .
the member state have suggested freezing the eu budget for two reason .
however , the budget ha grown only very slowly .
our ambition is to have a competitive , sustainable and inclusive europe .
the european parliament should have had the courage to set priority .
it will be the guide for the forthcoming financial perspective .
cohesion policy is a result of the solidarity principle .
the common agricultural policy ( cap ) ha been a success .
this report is a perfect example of this exercise .
the path proposed in this report is something else ; something very different .
the peace process in ireland ha benefited hugely from the eu budget .
i urge all member to support the retention of these important programme .
finally , the union must grant itself financial resource that match it ambition .
i do not believe that the overall size of the budget should increase .
the current system is very complicated and lack transparency .
this is a line that we can not support .
this report is perhaps one of the most important of this legislature .
the new eu financing system must be more transparent , simpler and fairer .
this mean that additional resource will be needed to finance a new objective .
the current system is very complicated and lack transparency .
in writing . - i voted with a heavy heart against this resolution .
the eu budget beyond 2013 must prioritise growth and job creation .
this will certainly help u face the new global challenge .
however , taxpayer want to see better value for money .
this report make europe 2020 the very framework of the future european budget .
not a single word is mentioned in connection with the nuclear issue .
the europe 2020 strategy is the eu 's response to such challenge .
demanding budgetary increase in this difficult situation is scandalous .
instead , we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make saving .
europe 's hardworking citizen are being required to pay more and more .
we should be aiming to reduce the burden , not increase it .
the europe 2020 strategy should be the implementation reference for the mff .
we must provide for adequate financing for large-scale research and development project .
reduced financing will have particularly negative consequence for farmer in all eu country .
we must improve system for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of cohesion policy .
a debate about this tax is important , but it requires in-depth analysis .
for these reason , among others , we abstained in the final vote .
i am wholly in favour of this idea and give it my support .
dwindling cohesion policy fund will continue to crush our economy .
i joined my fellow conservative in voting against this report .
( written statement abbreviated in accordance with rule 149 )
approval of the minute of the previous sitting : see minute
we can become competent only when such matter are translated into legislation .
my country 's new constitution doe not apply such discrimination .
my country 's new constitution is a democratic , written constitution .
my country 's new constitution is proud to guarantee a strong constitutional protection .
the new hungarian constitution doe not restrict the right of same-sex people .
this debate and those that have preceded it are testimony to that concern .
and yes , i am worried about the spill-over of these hungarian pattern .
they will not be approved , but the attempt is there .
european institution must not be shy at such time .
this is a union of different culture and differing priority .
this sort of thing erodes the function of election a a democratic instrument .
this is because , firstly , constitution are not watertight .
it is therefore an issue for the sovereignty of all .
i would like to take this opportunity to just say one thing .
this is because you are speaking out very boldly on their behalf .
or condemned for something which they have not done ?
one example is the principle mentioned earlier for adopting the constitution .
how should we , from the country directly affected , perceive this constitution ?
this is the declaration that the 1949 constitution is invalid .
this is a major setback on the road of transition .
the process of preparing and adopting the new constitution wa hardly legitimate .
the preamble is exclusionary and reflects a distorted interpretation of history .
check and balance are weakened , especially the independence of the judiciary .
twenty-one year ago , we were not required to fight for freedom .
one last point : there wa also an ombudsman on data protection .
this is something that is heavily criticised by me and by my group .
madam president , my reply to m gál is a follows .
the issue wa not a comparison with other member state ' constitution .
the issue wa : what is a european value ?
you know how important symbol are in politics a well .
however , the framework for the proper functioning of the state is problematic .
the level of protection of human right is decreased .
this is not about member state , this is about fundamental right .
fundamental right is about the very foundation of the european union .
not one person ha actually quoted from the constitution itself .
i am pleased to find such sentiment in a constitution .
this may not please all member of this house .
european value are being questioned in the new hungarian constitution .
therefore , we have to discus it and have to do so now .
there is still time before the adoption of the generic law .
sadly , the hungarian constitution doe not fulfil these criterion .
there wa no , or very little , social consultation .
the new constitution raise question on an international level .
the principle of good governance doe not prevail in the document either .
the constitution fails to provide an eu-conforming , modern , administrative structure .
they make governing the country almost impossible for any future government .
my country , along with others , ha experience of this .
( hu ) mr alvaro , this is true , just one sentence .
it can be changed in other country a well .
( de ) madam president , many thanks for your question .
accordingly , i believe that we can discus such issue .
no , i do not think it is the most modern .
i would like to hear your answer to this question .
is caring about future human being a european value - or not ?
( de ) madam president , i hold mr landsbergis in high esteem .
however , i am unable to find a question in his speech .
the question is whether this is to be restricted or defined in future .
mr gál , constitution and bridge must also be built by people .
commissioner reding , i would like to draw your attention to this .
that is true , but this constitution violates the sovereignty of other state .
commissioner , this is a matter of the utmost importance .
it openly take advantage of minority in neighbouring country for extreme nationalist end .
it is saturated with the spirit of greater hungary .
can you imagine hungarian political party mounting an election campaign in another country ?
it brings the spirit of the balkan war to central europe .
it is a genuine effort to reflect modern value within the european context .
these are found in the german , polish and irish constitution .
gay right are protected by the eu charter of fundamental right .
yes , it is for hungary to decide the hungarian constitution .
i am talking , for example , about article 23 .
it meet with rejection , however , from hungary .
first , i would like to make a correction .
my sincere answer is : i can not answer your question .
i am referring to article d for mr weber 's benefit .
this is going back in time , not moving with the time .
( nl ) madam president , these thing are constantly being played down .
i would like to hear some answer from you about that .
( hu ) madam president , commissioner reding , i am addressing you .
these are all extremely important and extremely dangerous element .
both that debate and this one are merely a pretext for attacking hungary .
while brussels is promoting cosmopolitanism , budapest is emphasising it heroic national past .
hungarian are focusing on national identity , their own state and common sense .
we should not violate our own treaty on european union .
this is not a matter in which we should get involved .
the european court of human right is not in luxembourg .
i would have framed some of the point in the hungarian constitution differently .
we do not have the right to interfere with the hungarian constitution .
fidesz wa given a two-thirds majority mandate to do this job .
so , why should this house be prevented from debating such a situation ?
well , there wa no clear line from the european parliament .
that is how we answer when european law is at stake .
you were unable to genuinely balance the way these were distributed .
all the member have had an opportunity to speak .
different country and different nationality have been shaped by different experience .
we are a nation that love freedom and democracy .
this is an issue of protecting our common value .
it is high time that this discussion wa brought to the table .
none of these requirement ha really been met in full .
they include hussain osman , one of the 2005 london bomber .
he came back within six week , from italy .
that need to be made explicit , and not implicit .
that doe nothing to help build confidence in european legal system .
doe the text of the directive leave too much leeway ?
madam president , m sippel described the european arrest warrant a a baby .
is it not in fact much more of a frankenstein 's monster ?
crime is not national ; crime is international and cross border .
that is why we need to cooperate across border .
a an instrument , however , it is indispensable .
this is what is happening now in the case of julian assange .
there are many irregularity in the swedish case against him .
mr assange ha not yet been charged with any specific offence .
why would the usa want mr assange to be extradited to sweden ?
he spent two month in prison for this , in appalling condition .
however , last year , poland suddenly demanded this entrepreneur 's extradition .
on this occasion , poland made use of the european arrest warrant .
ten day ago , he wa transferred to poland .
in addition , four new charge were suddenly added to his sheet .
the judge even insinuated that these could lead to a new arrest warrant .
that is why my group is pinning it hope on the commissioner .
what you see today is a rare occurrence here .
proportionality , protection and redress are the key to reforming this tool .
it is essential that we do not make the same mistake again .
of course , the european investigation order need careful implementation .
i trust the honourable gentleman share our wish in that regard .
therefore , i am very thankful to you for having initiated this debate .
the advantage of the european arrest warrant by far outweigh any possible inconvenience .
however , such assessment should always be made by the issuing authority .
a lot ha already been said about the success .
that is the reason why the commission asks for action .
all these procedural right apply to the arrest warrant .
this is something that wa said by an irish judge .
the oral question we have today for our group is very simple .
i sat through the appeal court hearing and heard the judge .
i agreed with his last remark a i heard it in translation .
( nl ) i make no secret of that , mr stoyanov .
i also have a case concerning mr hörchner , another dutch national .
suspect and defendant have right both a people and a party to proceeding .
what do you intend to do about this commissioner ?
( microphone off until near end of first sentence ) ... liberal democrat .
case which were extremely unequal in severity were given equal treatment .
warrant have been issued when their use wa both unnecessary and disproportionate .
this is why we wanted to ask the commission and council these question .
they clearly fall under the power of the member state .
well , now she is putting her headphone on .
in my opinion , the commission should be prepared for that .
the problem is that politician are very often le humble than scientist .
you drew attention to some of these weakness in your recent report .
i do not believe that this is what wa intended .
the result of these omission are at the root of this debate today .
in 2002 , parliament had no power of codecision in these matter .
all of these can , must and are being dealt with .
we must also respect fundamental human right and include safeguard like habeas corpus .
these factor undermine the trust that is necessary for judicial cooperation .
i hope i can also count on the member state .
better implementation is , i think , in the interest of u all .
this ha been standard extradition practice for at least 50 year .
it is enough to mention the 1957 council of europe convention on extradition .
i think that those who mentioned this were right .
high representative and vice-president ashton will attend , a will commissioner de gucht .
overall , our relation have improved over the last two year .
energy also figure prominently in our dealing with moscow .
we will also underline the need to cooperate on fighting climate change .
we must be clear at the summit that there are no political short-cuts .
thank you for your attention and i look forward to your comment .
russia is our great neighbour ; russia is an important partner .
the negotiation on the energy chapter are also behind schedule .
lastly , the import ban on european vegetable ( ... )
i hope that the negotiation will not take too long .
however , russia also need to play it part .
the commissioner ha already mentioned the importance of visa liberalisation .
i hope that we will soon make some progress on this .
that is something that should be made clear to russia at the summit .
we want to see proper , fair election in russia too .
russia need to realise that democracy will be good for russia too .
furthermore , russia must abide by her own constitution .
russia ha to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of it neighbour .
neither is it a country which enjoys an independent judiciary .
that is also something we will have to talk about in nizhny novgorod .
genuine and proper election form part of the foundation of democracy .
fair election start with allowing the registration of party .
it result and conclusion should be published a soon a possible .
how doe our own behaviour appear , however , from outside the union ?
this is the case whether we like it or not .
we must make this partnership a positive and constructive one .
this also precludes using energy a a political weapon , for example .
we have a shared responsibility in the global world .
one can also put a positive slant on this .
my second point concern the partnership for modernisation between the eu and russia .
i would therefore urge the commission to step up the pace .
we have not succeeded in resolving anything new since then .
is that the best we can expect in this area ?
do we expect nothing more of russia 's democratisation ?
let u have one summit , a we do with america .
we have enough exchange with russia in the specialist area .
russia 's discrediting of shale gas extraction project is causing additional alarm .
the human right problem is most apparent in the khodorkovsky case .
russia is the eu 's third biggest trading partner .
that is the only way we will make any progress .
madam president , yet another eu-russia summit is taking place this week .
major change have occurred in the world since the last one .
climate change ha brought more and more dangerous consequence .
our union must share it bed with a bear .
a the commissioner said , the last two year have seen improvement .
progress this month in solving the transnistria conflict would be another positive step .
georgia ha , in fact , played a key role here .
however , russia doe not seem to be budging at all .
the question of nuclear safety is particularly relevant following fukushima .
i feel that eu and russian relation with belarus should also be discussed .
the nord stream issue is typical in this respect .
russia must observe certain rule a regard the wto .
the kaliningrad oblast may represent an exception to this rule .
this is a great opportunity to gain independence from russia .
so far , unfortunately , there is no real progress .
it is therefore up to the eu to make one issue very clear .
we can help russia come to term with it past .
russia certainly ha no right to a sphere of influence .
it surely ha the right , however , to safety and international security .
such a sense of security would certainly liberalise the internal situation in russia .
please make this very clear to the russian side on our behalf .
we need a common foreign affair and security policy .
we also need to speak clearly on human right .
we should make the strategic partnership closer , deeper and broader .
we should also bring new idea for mutually beneficial cooperation .
european producer need new opportunity to sell their product .
russia is an enormous trade area , with ever increasing purchasing power .
we would also like a list of the member of the negotiating group .
it is absolutely essential that human right are respected and observed .
reform of the european neighbourhood policy may help resolve the conflict in transnistria .
new negotiation on current sanitary regulation could improve this situation .
this is why all the relevant agreement need to be revised .
this would offer an alternative source to that provided by the nabucco project .
russia is a rising country and a developing country in term of wealth .
we have seen that we have convergent view on many subject .
but we should aim to make significant progress in a number of area .
this is an important instrument and it potential should be fully used .
madam president , honourable member , the european union and russia are partner .
we have talked about some of these problematic aspect today .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( 9 june 2011 ) .
sudan and south sudan ( motion for resolution tabled ) : see minute
no doubt there are more important petition than this one .
perhaps i might make another comment before going further .
this take u to what is at the heart of the petition .
one particular point stood out for u in respect of such facility .
for u , it is an important instrument for achieving sustainable development .
the austrian legal provision wa not really satisfactory in the past .
it concerned an area of 10 hectare or of 20 hectare or more .
moreover , earlier expansion are also now to be included in the appraisal .
we place great importance on an overall analysis of the impact on nature .
the european court of justice ha confirmed our interpretation of the law .
these are the obligation with which the austrian authority did not comply .
mr potočnik is currently working on a revision of the eia directive .
for that , of course , you need ski run .
in this case , it seems that thing went wrong .
in many case when thing go wrong , nothing happens .
i consider what you have said to be very important .
i hope that you will bear this case in mind in future proceeding .
we are talking here about a project in damüls-mellau .
i believe that there is no reason to reproach these authority .
finally , we should probably also carry out a political appraisal .
too often , we can not see the wood for the tree .
rule must always be followed to the letter and rightly so .
currently , the discussion is always polarised : either nature or job .
we politician have , unfortunately , also used this type of argument .
will the whole alpine region be subject to an environmental impact assessment ?
he should define the criterion more accurately and explain exactly what he mean .
the natural world is not the property of the conservation organisation .
nature is there to be used by the people .
you could say that the region is now under closer scrutiny .
of course , i do not mean that entirely seriously .
the commission now ha the option of initiating an infringement procedure .
mr wieland asked how the definition of the area should be regarded .
we will give you a written answer on this issue .
how could we have influenced the process at an earlier stage ?
let me remind colleague what we are talking about here .
rogue business directory company are both inflicting financial damage and harassing small company .
hundred of letter of complaint are still being received from new victim .
but there is a lack of effective legal remedy and enforcement .
the misleading practice of business directory are causing problem for numerous company .
three year ago , we commissioned a survey and received thousand of complaint .
the 2006 directive ha been implemented by all the member state .
thank you very much for your broad support on this matter .
commissioner , obviously , there is a legislative framework .
the stockholm programme say that we need to address these issue directly .
nevertheless , there is no need to introduce new legislation .
i met an elderly lady whose husband wa a taxi driver .
i could not tell her not to pay the money .
that wa the best advice i could give her .
there are lot of other example , which i know you have heard .
these company give their identity and they give their address .
these company are like predatory shark and they should be stopped .
these figure only partly reflect the suffering of the victim of these scam .
finally , we must severely punish those involved in this system .
we should encourage member state to be stricter in this area .
the problem is that people are still waiting for this help to arrive .
we hear about survey , information gathering , and stakeholder meeting .
these type of scam will continue until the commission take tough action .
these company often target victim that are based in another member state .
( el ) madam president , unfair commercial practice are like water .
a soon a they find a crack , in they go .
it is unacceptable that more and more citizen are being scammed .
we have been waiting for these action for over 20 year .
madam president , the position is exactly a colleague have pointed out .
we need a robust european legislative solution , and we need it quickly .
i urge the commission to apply the accelerated legislative procedure .
in my opinion , a europol investigation is also warranted .
many entity are deterred from taking legal action by the cost .
how have they applied the directive on misleading and comparative advertising ?
and yet we are not powerless in this matter .
they enjoy a high standing among european consumer thanks to their prestige .
unfortunately , not all member state have transposed this text into their legislation .
revising the directive would provide the instrument needed to combat this practice .
i would like to ask you to take the problem seriously .
therefore , this is not primarily a problem of adapting national law .
secondly , there is often a failure to prosecute .
simply saying 'rubbish ' is not an argument , mr turmes .
in any case , we had a tough struggle .
this wa often very unsatisfactory from the perspective of the citizen .
i said 'in the middle ' , mr harm .
stage 3 is new and is made up of peer review .
for this reason , i incorporated their expectation into the negotiation .
i would like to make a very specific distinction here .
please allow me to finish what i have to say .
if you want more speaking time , parliament itself can decide on this .
you are a member of parliament and i am not .
however , one area which wa not included is crime .
we want to submit an interim report in november .
i look forward to reporting the result to you a soon a possible .
we have not done our job and neither have you .
the resolution wa here on the table and you voted against it .
it is dishonest and it doe not allow u to make progress .
it is naïve to believe that we can do what we want .
there is a very specific legal position which we have to follow .
we need to exert more pressure and show more initiative .
the assurance that they will be safe are only empty assurance .
what kind of a picture of solidarity and moral is that ?
i can not speak on behalf of the german government .
in this respect , i think that your remark are justified .
madam president , mr reul , you are the chair of the committee .
lady and gentleman , let u all calm down a little .
now i must tell you we are not totally satisfied .
the peer review method , involving seven expert , is one step .
carrying out a risk analysis now is an appropriate but isolated measure .
the proposed stress test are , however , too weak .
the safety of nuclear power plant is a european issue .
we also know about the problem in the monitoring system .
however , today you have made a big mistake .
this is what we will judge you on again .
i believe it is important to mention this here from a german perspective .
however , i said nothing about this in my previous speech .
i think the accusation that you have made against him here are outrageous .
i am waiting for him to follow up on what he said .
would she not admit that this is actually true ?
we very much regret the fact that this will not be happening .
after fukushima , the first victim there were the worker and the fireman .
i have often visited chernobyl , including the exclusion zone .
do not allow yourself to be influenced by the lobbyist in the commission .
you need to keep a critical distance from them .
is a joint review of stress test now required ?
it is surprising that they have not been carried out before .
you need to make sure that the test are genuinely comprehensive .
it is also clear that you have not made a comprehensive evaluation .
this really must be included in the stress test .
will some of the power plant really be shut down or modernised ?
it is high time that the euratom treaty wa revised .
madam president , certain member state have jumped the gun on stress test .
( de ) madam president , i have a question for mr strejček .
that is what we can not accept , commissioner .
in my opinion , that is how we can cope with this issue .
standard applied in the european union are among the highest in the world .
a we consistently strive for this , we must speak with one voice .
we must not use eu citizen ' money to support unsafe nuclear energy .
fukushima ha shown that we must imagine the unimaginable .
security would benefit , a would transparency and citizenship at european level .
( fr ) madam president , we actually have two question facing u .
the first is about the nuclear share in europe .
the first principle is that a control mechanism must be obligatory .
the third principle is that this mechanism should be binding .
this wa very good news and a very good decision .
that is dishonest and this is why we are critical of you .
we need to take an honest look at this issue .
he ha struggled and he ha achieved a great deal .
this is the first step , but we must go further .
we need to extend it to cover our neighbouring country .
please introduce a target and then we will have a very good proposal .
that is an important piece of added value and an additional requirement .
mr piebalgs ' nuclear safety directive wa also successful .
of course , one-off stress test are not enough .
i can only endorse what ha already been said today .
you have explained why that is the case and we can understand that .
the only thing that worry me is this false sense of security .
are you possibly going to adjust the stress test ?
i would ask you to be responsible , therefore .
so yes , commissioner , we agree with you .
it is low carbon and it can provide a secure supply .
this is such an important issue for u all .
i believe europe need nuclear power , but it need safe nuclear power .
this is why the stress test are so important .
at one point in the future , these policy should be merged .
80 % of those who work in the nuclear industry are subcontractor .
furthermore , we are familiar with the geostrategy of terrorist risk .
we may welcome this or we may regret it .
a a democrat , i have to accept it .
mr turmes , aircraft crash are covered by the stress test .
i will be happy to talk about this afterwards .
however , we have persuaded every member state to take part .
i am determined to promote this over the next few month .
the proposal to revise the euratom treaty is wonderful .
i do not believe that it is very likely .
the next question concern the independence of the test .
to assume otherwise would be unfair to our official .
then there is the question of belarus and russia .
for this reason , we can only call on the government to change .
i will be happy to have more in-depth discussion on this subject .
this should be a matter of concern for the entire eu .
people in the house wondered if the thousand of victim were not enough .
romania is already in the process of carrying out the stress test .
furthermore , we can not simply focus on nuclear safety in the eu .
the effect of a nuclear disaster often cross national boundary .
i am grateful to mr mauro for that apt intervention ...
they are the youth of today , on whom the future depends .
support for this declaration signal parliament 's support for the future .
mr bütikofer ha voted on behalf of mr turmes .
( for the result and other detail on the vote : see minute )
i would like to focus attention on the matter of visa waiver .
that is why we should not rush these thing unnecessarily .
construction of the nord stream gas pipeline is a clear example of this .
of course , there are many problem from our perspective .
firstly , there is russia 's membership of the world trade organisation .
thirdly , visa waiver between the eu and russia is the right goal .
they are difficult to combat effectively with the law a it stand .
i would like to explain why the situation in germany is so difficult .
we must make every effort to prevent this from happening .
mr president , i would like to agree with the previous speaker .
south sudan is expected formally to declare it independence on 9 july 2011 .
the uk is one of the world 's largest donor of foreign aid .
the security situation in the state of abyei is very worrying .
support for south sudan must be one of our priority .
long-term peace and security must prevail in this region .
in one month , a new state will be born .
to this end , international support will be necessary .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this resolution .
i am voting in favour of the joint resolution on the eu-russia summit .
these trend were not dispelled but rather intensified by the cold war .
not even the united state ha given any assurance that it doe not .
the supply of natural resource should not be used a a political tool .
can the eu really trust a state that selectively applies international law ?
anything le mean not living up to our own principle .
it doe not criticise nato 's plan for a european anti-missile shield .
russia 's action have caused a negative response in the eu .
overall , i support the resolution and i voted in favour .
energy and nuclear security is another basis for strong and stable cooperation .
the supply of natural resource can not be used a a political tool .
russia share responsibility with the european union for maintaining global stability .
i endorse the principle of the resolution on the eu-russia summit .
in the summer period , it financial effect on producer are colossal .
granting such right should be a sovereign matter for each country .
however , such regulation do not encompass misleading contract in other member state .
these directory company are clearly not only deceptive and misleading .
however , i do not think we need to create new legislation .
only later doe the business learn that it must pay a fee .
if the situation doe not improve , further action are required .
misleading advertising and dishonest trading practice are bad for the internal market .
parliament continues to receive petition and complaint about business directory company .
to that end , we must set out effective mean for redress .
this enables business directory company to abuse the current situation unopposed .
this practice herald from spain but could happen elsewhere .

the african union ( au ) could do far more .
sadly , the portent for stability and reconciliation in madagascar are not good .
this is particularly true of the resolution on madagascar .
the role of the european union is to help them .
unfortunately , we have all seen that it wa a failure .
through a neutral , inclusive and consensual transition process .
i hope that in spite of this , such help can be effective .
these matter must be investigated and their perpetrator punished .
however , the effort to find solution must not be abandoned .
madagascar ha an illegal government in power which the people have not elected .
even it natural rich and renewable natural resource have failed to promote prosperity .
the madagascan live in squalor and poverty on their island .
in addition to the human suffering , madagascar 's biodiversity is under threat .
rajoelina 's administration breach human right and oppresses it own citizen .
why , then , should he be trusted this time ?
this is an ideal opportunity to restore constitutional order and call new election .
we must think about the madagascan people , who need our support .
that is the purpose of the work we are doing here .
the country 's security service are guilty of violence against ordinary people .
now i believe that we have reached a turning point .
the detention camp in guantánamo bay is a reflection of this tragic situation .
author . - mr president , europe stand right against capital punishment .
perhaps they did exist , but there is no proof of this .
so i am interested a to the source of this information .
for those men , this is a case of arbitrary detention .
we must not even speak of it today , in this resolution !
i am against double standard being applied to human right .
i do not need any lesson from you in this regard .
let me say that i do not have any animosity towards the u .
i have always denounced all human right abuse , wherever they are committed .
we are fighting in support of the rule of international law .
however , that must be the subject of proper legal proceeding .
mr president , i have enormous respect for bernd posselt .
the biggest democracy in the world is , of course , india .
i have never heard the european union described a a country before .
if we act unjustly , we are le credible and even weak .
that mean we must openly be able to talk about country involved .
even in this parliament , that still appears to be difficult .
mr president , similar to mr vergiat , i do not support torture .
the total number of detainee at guantánamo since it wa opened is 775 .
we , for our part , ask for universality of human right .
all execution , wherever they take place , should be condemned .
mr president , i wish to stress the case of abd al-nashiri .
the u attorney general called for the death penalty .
however , all defendant must enjoy the right to a fair trial .
however , it ha been based on an ideological , confrontational approach .
president yanukovych and his authority must bring an end to this persecution .
they jeopardise the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy in ukraine .
first and foremost , they are all citizen of a democratic state .
these charge to me have a smell of being politically motivated .
we have done this not once , but many time .
others country move somewhat slower - maybe ukraine is an example of that .
it ha made progress , but it need to go a bit further .
we are not here to decide whether these people are guilty or innocent .
democracy must make progress in ukraine and we can support this process .
the eu ha a delegation in the country and is monitoring development carefully .
these principle must not be called into question in any way .
in addition , the country must make more decisive effort to combat corruption .
the european parliament is not a lawyer 's office .
we should recommend to the accused to cooperate with investigating body .
the european parliament should ask the ukrainian prosecutor general to lift this ban .

we also want to have a debate on this .
we now move on to the order of business .
the deadline for tabling amendment is at 16:00 today .
there are no comment , so these amendment are accepted .
in addition , the following change have been requested :
we shall now move on to the order of business for thursday .
mr klute ha the floor to present the request .
our reason for wanting to do so are quite simple .
we therefore think a more careful approach to these issue is required .
preparation for the european council meeting ( 24 june 2011 ) ( debate )
in january , we promised to run a parliament-friendly presidency .
we have a common responsibility and therefore our success or failure is shared .
the forthcoming european council mark the end of the hungarian presidency .
the european council will bring the first european semester to a conclusion .
the initial position of parliament carried approximately 2 000 amendment .
i take this opportunity to thank you all sincerely for this experience .
let me now turn to justice and home affair .
it will also discus idea a regard a possible safeguard mechanism .
it also requires an effective and updated monitoring and evaluation system .
let me touch upon the free movement of person .
both belong to the most visible and popular achievement of european integration .
the member state are aware of this and fully intend to safeguard them .
the presidency welcome the positive result of the most recent trialogue meeting .
regarding the european asylum policy : recent development have put this under strain .
safe and efficient asylum procedure are required for people in need of protection .
the objective must be to address the root cause of irregular migration .
to that end , partnership will be developed with southern neighbourhood country .
the european council will return to this matter at it december 2011 meeting .
serbia ha taken a giant step towards eu accession .
at the end i will also make some comment regarding greece .
the second major issue for the european council is migration .
migration , let u face it , is a very emotive issue .
this doe not mean rolling back the abolition of internal border .
fiscal consolidation is entirely necessary , but the goal is growth .
the greek government is ready to engage with u in this approach .
therefore , she know what parliament is all about .
my group , lady and gentleman , is calling for a shake-up .
we simply want an assurance that they will be complied with .
i call on everyone in this chamber to recognise that .
i believe that we should be under no illusion .
i read an interesting line in a german newspaper this week .
we are in a crisis of confidence in the european project .
our problem have been known for a long time .
we do not need le europe , we need more of it !
we need more courage to overcome the crisis using european resource .
these people also decide on the fate of the people of this continent .
who is actually paying the credit rating agency for their rating ?
they are clearly not working simply for a reward in heaven .
of course , they receive money for their proposal from stakeholder .
the only way that they can do this is by uniting .
if i sell a financial product , i pay no tax .
let u be honest about another thing : the crisis is not over .
such measure should end the crisis a regard the euro and greece .
that is the key question for the tomorrow 's council .
if so , we need a positive plan for it .
they can not emerge from the crisis based only on austerity .
let u , for example , give guarantee for private investment .
let u give them loan from the european investment bank .
( fr ) i am going to make my comment in french .
mr daul 's group comprises member of the nea dimokratia party .
i experienced this in belgium for nine year , mr lange .
i would ask you , mr barroso , to rectify this .
greece ha a duty to push ahead with major structural reform and privatisation .
at the same time , it can not be defended at any cost .
we are surely on the final page of the bail-out chapter .
i would say that parliament is not always a shining example , either .
i do not know whether you are still pursuing the financial transaction tax .
this parliament ha expressed it support for this many time .
mr lange , the german treuhand agency did a number of positive thing .
however , we lack the courage to do this .
the cause of the crisis are not being dealt with .
what a fine mess you have got u into .
then , and only then , can real austerity package work .
mr president , the united kingdom went through this exactly twenty year ago .
it cost 1 million british people their job unnecessarily .
we did not join the euro , thank god .
what doe mr barroso actually base this power upon ?
the power of the commission is expanding further and further .
it is time we put a stop to that .
on that point , mr barroso wa actually right .
the european summit really can not reach any other conclusion .
so we will come forward with that proposal by october .
these are the concrete answer to the concrete question .
i would just like to add two thought on this matter .
it wa internal policymaking by italy 's minister of reform , umberto bossi .
in denmark , too , the reason were of an internal political nature .
instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free europe .
mr barroso , you will certainly have parliament 's support in that .
allow me to add a few word with regard to greece .
this situation can be abused from two different side .
these measure are a step in the right direction .
in other word , no abuse from either side .
i believe that what ha been said here is right .
the people in greece need a light at the end of the tunnel .
that is why a growth strategy is so important .
what is happening with respect to mr samara is totally irresponsible .
this is where this reverse qualified majority come in .
no ordinary citizen will understand what that actually mean .
then we will not be able to support this package .
i would like to see substantial support for this project from this house .
therefore , mr graf lambsdorff surely ha nothing to answer .
we have talked about europe a great deal in the european parliament today .
i should just like to make one patriotic comment in this multinational chamber .
what are we greek politician and the greek people asking for ?
we are asking for your respect and your solidarity .
member state have been changed beyond recognition by migration .
the time ha come to stop the flow and encourage it reversal .
the accession of croatia is also on the agenda .
i suspect that a free and fair referendum in not on the card .
moreover , this response can not be a reform of the schengen treaty .
on the contrary , it should be a strengthening of the schengen treaty .
the risk of contamination of every single member state is a real one .
we must go back to the basic , encourage investment and promote growth .
in fact it is steering by sight , with no precise aim .
unless there is proof to the contrary , that is the truth .
i think that is the only feasible way forward .
this wa disastrous over the issue of greece 's fraudulent statistic .
it is important to remember that greece wa the cradle of democracy .
in other word , greece must regain it credibility .
no match can be won by playing alone , however .
the greek crisis could have been controlled in it early stage .
the recommendation must be applied by member state to prevent stability being jeopardised .
agreement must be reached on the meaning of economic governance .
the schengen area ha been a major talking point recently .
in exactly the same way it mean one for all .
their application should become a rule , not an object of political bargaining .
my country , estonia , faced a deep economic crisis three year ago .
however , we acted , balanced the budget and entered the euro zone .
latvia acted too and is clearly back on track .
we all have to act in reforming our society .
we are struggling manfully to reach our target in relation to the bail-out .
i hope that we can still reach a breakthrough in the council .
europe need the introduction of economic governance a soon a possible .
in libya , the population ha doubled in the last 20 year .
if this is lacking then we will never practise what we preach .
greece wa very much present in most of our intervention .
austerity must therefore be accompanied by pro-growth policy and measure .
we know how to help country improve their educational system .
however , the same message need to come from the greek political establishment .
the time is right and this would be a highly responsible gesture .
the last word of thanks go to m enikő győri .
she said many time that she wanted to lead a parliament-friendly presidency .
i think she ha proved it with her frequent presence in this house .
we have even achieved concession on reverse qualified majority voting .
the dramatic effect of the so-called austerity measure are highly visible .
nonetheless , the european council is preparing a fresh assault .
i am wondering what the outcome of this council will be .
the increased right of illegal immigrant make deportation almost impossible .
i hope that the european council will formalise this matter .
this is a long process which requires sacrifice to be made .
however , the integration effort are rewarded in the end .
denmark wa planning to take a decision to this effect .
the european union must take a firm , united stance on this decision .
there is a long history of cooperation in the danube region .
it ha become an important mainstay of the european unification process .
with an ever-changing situation , there were also more and more reform .
i believe that there will be cross-group opposition to this .
the simplification of the common agricultural policy remains an important task .
we are also calling for a fair distribution among the member state .
direct payment will continue to play an important role in maintaining regional vitality .
this is a particular challenge in area with significant natural limitation .
i have also paid close attention to your proposal on market measure .
i intend to develop specific legislative proposal on these point .
i agree with your comment on improving and enhancing rural development measure .
i wa interested to read your proposal regarding young farmer .
i hope that this will be a very productive discussion .
mr president , commissioner , today we are debating the common agricultural policy .
we must enable the preservation of the environment in which we live .
it is time to move away from the use of historical payment .
in my opinion , it is both balanced and ambitious .
of course farming need to take a positive approach to environmental issue .
i am making the point this afternoon because it is my honest opinion .
that is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to .
there is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled .
we have got to get our head around this somehow .
that is going to be a tremendous challenge for u in this parliament .
we have got to look at how we spend the money .
are we spending our money a wisely a we can ?
is there not too much of it going on administration ?
is there not too much going on bureaucracy and red tape ?
and is not enough being given towards food security ?
again like greening , people talk about food security a a throw-away line .
we could be facing a crisis in the next nine or ten year .
i believe that we have achieved these objective with the report .
this , too , is incorporated into the report .
then taxpayer will be prepared to pay for it .
parliament ha proved itself capable of making such policy .
this wa supported by a large majority in committee .
it is high time that we made a start on this .
we are all agreed that a strong second pillar is important .
we also need far more research funding in europe .
perhaps it is just a local problem in the back row .
we have web streaming and i am sure the interpretation will be there .
that is not what we think , of course .
lastly , commissioner , i would like to mention the issue of import .
at the same time we must seek to make farming business competitive .
i can not avoid underlining the need for adequate financing for the cap .
this house can not accept a rural development funding cut .
we have succeeded in seeing our main concern included in this report .
these include the climate , biodiversity and the eutrophication of waterway .
there are all sort of example i could give here .
the agricultural sector is in decline , particularly in the new member state .
i think that this report mark a huge step forward .
it wa not easy at the outset : the situation wa fairly confrontational .
however , the important thing is that we reached a consensus .
in my opinion , this wa another fundamental point .
lastly , at present , we are worried about the real budgetary threat .
that aid wa part of the common agricultural policy budget .
the report clearly outline a new direction - agricultural greening .
proper inspection and enforcement of greening measure will also be impossible .
cultivation of gm crop should be the decision of individual member state .
it is too much of a strain on our farmer ' finance .
after all , europe is not alone in the world .
the primary aim of agriculture ha always been to produce food .
now is not the time to fall out over minutia .
( el ) madam president , we obviously need a strong cap .
the agricultural sector provides clear added value to the european economy .
the idea of a flat rate throughout the european union is broadly opposed .
the proposal for a new farm income stabilisation instrument is a good idea .
we want a sustainable , ecological and social agricultural policy .
we want greening and we want it in the first pillar .
if this is done , there will be no reform .
everything will then stay the same a it is .
that will be quite inexplicable to the citizen of europe .
these are tough time and budget are not limitless .
well-functioning farming structure would be dramatically affected by cut in the second pillar .
mr barroso would be well advised to heed what this house is saying .
we need to have sufficient funding to respond to these challenge .
this move will be institutionalising inefficiency and there is no justification for it .
we stand for competitive and sustainable agriculture in europe .
that mean that our farmer produce food of the highest quality .
a solution need to be found here that is fair to both side .
we will support you , commissioner , in these effort .
innovation , research and development are of key importance a well .
programme for young farmer are also just a important .
well it is a bit like the legendary curate 's egg .
that is important to ensure food security and avoid price volatility .
we must supply safe and high-quality food at affordable price .
we must care for the environment when producing and processing food .
good price and market stability guarantee an income for farmer .
these are measure which should fall under the second pillar and cohesion policy .
i believe that this is what the des report doe .
two pillar are being proposed : direct payment and rural development .
historical criterion are to be removed and objective criterion are required .
there is no suggestion of an equal direct payment for all member state .
the emphasis is on the environmental element , which is also being simplified .
this includes making allocation in the first pillar , in particular , fairer .
i think it is high time to give up the historical approach .
what we are proposing is balanced support for a range of agricultural practice .
then there is the question of a more targeted common agricultural policy .
that is the kind of instrument that we will be proposing .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
the common agricultural policy must become fairer and simpler .
we need to safeguard farmer ' welfare and strengthen local economy .
food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy .
the cap 's second pillar is of paramount importance for rural development .
this house ha reached a compromise in the report under discussion .
after all , their primary role is to produce food .
in our view , farmer must be rewarded for providing service to society .
the report is a good compromise ; it is a european compromise .
a regulatory policy-based framework should be developed with long-term goal in mind .
restriction on current level of national aid can not be acceptable after this .
food security is and will remain the main challenge facing eu agriculture .
we expect to see it included in the commissioner 's legislative proposal .
i also welcome the measure proposed for maintaining territorial balance in the eu .
the situation in agricultural sector differs in the various member state .
service provided by agriculture must therefore be recompensed by fair product price .
the report by mr des is a good basis for continuing the reform .
we are gambling with the future of the eu itself .
i refer to the important statement that promote our southern agriculture .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
these issue should be at the heart of the political agenda .
parliament wanted responsibility a co-legislator and ha carried them out to the full .
they are also graded , which is an important aspect .
agreement on a balanced , high-quality text is in sight .
my first word is one of confidence , in a positive vein .
it is possible to innovate with the macroeconomic imbalance procedure .
all these step have been taken a essential part of parliament 's role .
europe will be much better prepared with this economic governance package .
so let me first talk about the directive that i have worked on .
indeed , i said i thought it would be irresponsible .
certainly , that wa my group 's motto in these negotiation .
there are other important point , particularly on the macroeconomic side .
i believe that all member state need to be subject to common surveillance .
we want to put those proposal back on track .
tomorrow , we will be voting on the report .
that is why this house ha proposed the reverse voting procedure .
mr president , that is no spirit of compromise .
we did not do that ; instead we changed the rule .
i would like to say a big thank you to my fellow member .
we can not afford for this to happen any longer .
the european council is meeting on thursday and friday .
unfortunately , that is what the original proposal wa like .
i am pleased that we were able to rectify that .
that is something that we will also do in parliament .
then we can have the legislation that europe so badly need .
the lesson wa learned that procedure have not been stringent and automatic enough .
at the same time , the already existing comply-or-explain procedure would be enhanced .
i warmly welcome the text that you have finalised .
and you have gained a good many important improvement from the council .
a we know , the council agrees with almost all of them .
you have introduced earlier sanction in the excessive imbalance procedure .
this is a very good result for parliament and for europe .
the report will , if appropriate , be accompanied by legislative proposal .
let me say a few word on the next step .
people watching the decision-making from outside are not interested in the smallest detail .
i believe you are all aware of the effort we have made .
i believe a solution can and must be found .
you have agreed on 99.9 % of the substance .
my third group of point relates to how macroeconomic surveillance is conducted .
mr ford spoke of it a a power struggle .
it is not a power struggle , it is a question of democracy .
this is the proof that fiscal stability lead to growth and employment .
we need to respect the rule of the stability and growth pact .
to put it bluntly , it simply failed to pull the ripcord .
the new regulation on macroeconomic surveillance should deal with these two problem .
we have developed a good scoreboard , albeit through long discussion .
we need to ensure that immediate measure are taken to counter imbalance .
that is more than likely necessary anyway in an economic and monetary union .
my group certainly take the view that we need to do that .
what message doe the council and commission have for them ?
well , i expect nothing quite frankly , nothing .
i would like to mention four point which i consider controversial .
however , there wa not the slightest sign of this .
none of this is to be found in the economic governance package .
today we are seeing the dramatic consequence in greece .
the euro area wa not and ha not become an optimal currency zone .
tomorrow it will probably come down to every last vote .
we do , in fact , want to equip you to do so .
you have derailed it , and that is a pity .
consequently , this package is by no mean balanced .
we will continue to fight for a better economic package .
greece used deceit to enable it to join the euro area .
the stability and growth pact must be reformed and the rule tightened up .
pacta sunt servanda - agreement must be kept - not a new greece !
mr bullman can ask the swedish member of his group .
the uk and other non-euro-zone country want to be good neighbour .
new rule need to ensure it is made stronger and more sustainable .
this ha shaken people 's faith in the process .
there is a great deal of discussion about greece .
we can no longer close our eye to the situation .
they must nonetheless be repeated time and again because nobody listens to them .
however , when one co-legislates , one must be responsible .
it is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need .
primarily , this package focus on crisis prevention , mitigation and solution .
we agree that nobody should compete while carrying around such a heavy burden .
to speak metaphorically , it ha one last shot .
the new package attempt to prevent this and to lay a new foundation .
the pact for the euro may possibly be toothless .
what we need are binding recommendation from the commission .
that is the lesson to be learned from the euro crisis .
i do have some point of criticism , however .
on the whole , i think that eurobonds are not a miracle solution .
i have had theological debate on this issue with mr goulard .
we could not agree , but i admire her a an opponent .
that really would read like 'eu economics for dummy ' .
therefore , mr president , we have before u the best text achievable .
on the contrary , they are owed all the wealth plundered by capital .
overturn the capitalist barbarity and the sovereignty of the monopoly . '
they admit that they are working on a purely intuitive basis .
do we want government that lie about their budget or their deficit ?
you can not ask a skeleton to tighten it belt .
obviously , this should never have been allowed to happen .
having said this , are these provision satisfactory , and are they enough ?
avoiding europe 's commitment to investment and employment is not acceptable .
we need unanimity to provide resource and qualified majority decision to avoid penalty .
we must pledge our commitment to europe and do it quickly .
we need to move forward , not backwards like crab .
europe must not hide when it is needed most .
the proposal before u grant the commission sweeping new power .
fortunately , the euro is stable both internally and externally .
that is why i say it is high time that we acted .
parliament ha been calling for measure for a long time .
the hungarian presidency ha negotiated well , a ha our side .
there were socialist government everywhere that these budgetary and financial problem have arisen .
in other word , your economic model doe not work .
really , mr bütikofer , you should know better by now .
you were in the government at the time , mr bütikofer .
now , however , it is for the greek to ...
this would also include investment in modernising energy supply system .
( fr ) mr president , i have two point .
first , greece : let u not try to re-write history .
today , a left-wing government is trying to get thing back into shape .
the only problem with them wa that they primarily want more money .
the problem can not be solved by throwing more money at it .
to u , this package is not sufficient and it is not balanced .
what should be the objective for a more integrated economic policy ?
for me , personally , that is not consistent .
we must now have the courage to decide what action is needed .
the main thrust of these measure lie in procedure and sanction .
i fear that this problem lie at the heart of this package .
the package is good and deserves to be voted through .
what we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline .
however , when something is good it is not necessarily enough .
the speech we have heard today have shown several thing .
we all knew that the eurozone wa not an optimum currency area .
the only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union .
there are two thing to which we need to open our eye .
the second item relates to the scope of this package .
however , we must remain firm on this principle .
deficit and sustainable growth can not go hand in hand .
would you be prepared to confirm this to parliament ?
i am addressing them too , just a mr langen addressed the communist .
we want to resolve the open issue and bring about integration .
we are in the midst of a crisis in the single currency .
these finding by the economist and the academic are quite surprising to me .
we have been heavily committed to this for year .
there wa talk of restrictive solution in respect of limiting the deficit .
i can not imagine a longer-term perspective in this situation .
yet these very document talk about a european semester , among other thing .
they also introduce a new procedure for excessive imbalance .
postponing decision-making on the package doe not solve the problem .
in the long run the eu is an economic union .
we need to get to the core reason for the problem .
the council , like parliament , is responsible for european .
we must take effective measure to prevent the euro from being destabilised .
that is the basic message of this excellent report produced by mr wortmann-kool .
this supervision is an essential element of the europe 2020 strategy .
that would ensure that we would stay out of crisis in the future .
prevention is better than cure and this is all about prevention .
however , do you really think you are on the right track ?
and how do we intend to get out of it ?
we are talking about a europe of the future .
we say that private investment is the solution to the problem .
they have gone to other area of the planet .
this is a step towards the introduction of eurobonds .
introducing new debt will exacerbate the european debt problem .
the enhanced economic governance framework will be underpinned by different interconnected policy .
we are treating the symptom rather than eliminating the cause .
why is it so important to adopt this package at the current juncture ?
that is the first building block of this legislative package .
we discussed all aspect of all the proposal at various level .
i believe it is essential for u to do so .
the fact is that the european union is imperfect and incomplete .
that , then , is the appeal that i am making here .
the package also form part of the euro 's defence .
that is the example that we must set here .
you can not say that , because it is not true .
that is why we have to give our citizen a very clear answer .
citizen expect the law to be applied equally to everyone .
this is an important issue : it is part of the agreement .
you have been a good lawyer ; you have moved the council along .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
for these country , the crisis wa the last nail in the coffin .
your pseudo economic governance go far beyond budgetary oversight .
it is nothing short of imposing oversight on our people and nation .
the economist joseph schumpeter talked about 'creative destruction ' .
let me give you a little more detail on our position .
in the itre , we have essentially reinforced the finance requirement .
we have taken the position that spent nuclear fuel must be controlled .
in this context , we have referred to the aarhus convention .
particular emphasis should be placed on the reversibility principle and the export requirement .
the commission 's first proposal wa not adopted in 2003 and 2004 .
i would like to make some additional remark about four specific area .
the starting position of all the member state is different .
we want to put in place a european legal framework .
it is important that the financing is also transparent .
we will submit these proposal to the council on your behalf .
i would like to thank you very much for your constructive support today .
we also consider it extremely important to keep in mind the human factor .
that mean making sure that radioactive waste remains under eu control and scrutiny .
the export of radioactive waste to third country must be banned .
ten thousand year ago we were living in cave .
for that reason we have to future-proof the decision that we take today .
i therefore welcome the commissioner 's remark on this .
further technological development in future decade should therefore be taken into consideration .
repository technology must allow a certain amount of future flexibility .
that is a moral imperative , and we must fulfil it .
europe must play a pioneering role , in particular in the international arena .
mr oettinger , i would like to congratulate you .
however , we will also need public participation across national border .
however , establishing such safety solely within europe is no great achievement .
the reason for this is that nuclear incident do not respect geographical border .
how can we spread the application of high european standard to other country ?
by this i mean cooperation and joint radioactive waste treatment project .
you have talked about support for the export ban .
you have also talked about the final solution for underground storage being reversible .
in that regard , you have my unqualified support .
i do have one concern , however , and that is underground storage .
are you definitely sure this is the safest method ?
nor is it one that is used anywhere else .
i agree that the utilisation of nuclear power belongs to national sovereignty .
this mean that national programme are useless unless financing issue are clarified .
the problem of radioactive waste need to be addressed and solved .
to be brief , there are two issue that i consider top priority .
the first is the ban on the transfer of waste .
we need to take measure that will also protect future generation .
regional research programme in this area have already proved their benefit .
i do not think that there is a conflict .
i agree that we should include your suggestion in the procedure .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
still , spent fuel is most frequently produced in nuclear plant .
this classification also determines whether it will undergo near-surface or deep geological disposal .
unfortunately , few place operate well-organised final disposal programme for nuclear waste .
a transparent process must be used for informing the general public .
political perversion mean nothing but lie and cynical deception of voter .
it turn out that they promise one thing , and do another .
i believe you will agree that that is perversion .
the common currency can not go on like this .
without doubt , fiscal prudence implies a shake-up in the consumer climate .
i do not see anything happening in that direction .
the campaign ha attracted high-profile support from across the political spectrum .
one can not ignore the will of people forever .
there have been referendum in member state and they have been ignored .
first and foremost , a strong , fair and well-financed cap ;
our economy are among the most dynamic in europe .
in a few month croatia will enter the union .
he wa the chief editor of the local television channel 'kolyma plyus ' .
we will be bringing medicine and reconstruction material that are desperately needed .
today we also have the statement of the venice commission .
welsh farmer feel the flawed eid system amount to a stealth tax .
trade in the global market depends upon a country 's produce being promoted .
such practice should be opposed , particularly here in the european parliament .
greenhouse gas emission reduction and risk of carbon leakage ( short presentation )
now it is clearly back on the political agenda .
it is not only a climate argument any more .
it ha become more and more an economic debate , an economic argument .
this is also a discussion on the adjustment of the emission trading system .
in addition , we have a responsibility to the rest of the world .
i hope that this will not be watered down .
the amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report .
the climate is affected by cycle lasting several century .
this is simply about ensuring that we have a reliable energy supply .
we will have to supplement or replace nuclear energy with gas and coal .
burning gas and coal will , of course , result in co2 emission .
gas and coal will play an important role in replacing nuclear energy .
this is why it need to reform the implementation of it green policy .
i believe that this is a serious , far-reaching and fair offer .
we believe that the principle of reliable planning should currently be given priority .
it is a new idea which is open to discussion .
however , i do not agree with the automatic mechanism .
we believe it would be wrong to move production deliberately .
then we would have put our money on the wrong solution .
the vote will take place on thursday 23 june 2011 .
we should instead go down the road of energy saving and renewable energy .
climate change present the international community with a serious challenge .
groundbreaking achievement are only possible on the basis of well-planned long-term investment .
it established wind power in place where it is not windy .
feed-in tariff have made profitable what should never really be profitable .
instead , the cost of both emission right and electricity will rise .
we accepted this challenge , however , and set about fulfilling our obligation .
hungary could be a real winner where green economic growth is concerned .
this is why we need to adopt ambitious co2 emission target .
therefore , raising this target to 30 % by 2020 is very realistic .
we embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism .
there are also other fact and policy that are coming to the fore .
so here is a part of our answer in the 2012 budget .
we have also clearly upgraded the priority relating to the europe 2020 strategy .
also upgraded is the lisbon-treaty-related expenditure , which is increased by 4 % .
there is our common obligation to respond to development globally .
this is especially the case of the southern mediterranean .
the experience of the 2011 procedure wa very instructive .
an example of this is latin america and it notorious underfunding .
there are a lot of opportunity open to u for innovation .
that is why we are hoping that this policy will receive definite support .
the updated regulation must be managed efficiently right from the start .
poor economic statistic could be one of the reason for the crisis .
mr lewandowski , you have said that a business-as-usual approach is not acceptable .
ultimately , this is all about small and medium-sized business .
the same applies to fine and interest on late payment .
mr president , i welcome the commissioner and my fellow member .
the 2012 budget should contribute to the achievement of our europe 2020 strategy .
we are now talking about the second year of this 10-year programme .
we can not say that this will only stop later .
we could not agree with the european council on a common approach .
european institution are failing spectacularly to understand the nature of the problem .
french , german and especially greek bank will have to be recapitalised .
the ecb ha basically been following the practice of communist country .
this is an absolutely critical issue for the next two year .
mr president , i would like to extend my congratulation to the rapporteur .
therefore , we welcome the work that mr balzani ha done .
research and development in our university and academic institution are also important .
we obviously need to find a solution to this .
unfortunately , adding value and demonstrating it are two different thing .
they would be meaningless without a budget to back them up .
otherwise , we simply will not be able to meet them .
this money ha to be found from the already cash-strapped national budget .
the seriousness of our intention implies our strong institutional credibility .
the crisis may burden the common budget more than planned .
rising discrimination and continuously spreading intolerance are our common concern across europe .
the next item is the joint debate on the following report :
we want to help the weakest region to establish better connection .
we must make sure that we have appropriate funding for all these task .
we want to strengthen the principle of multi-level governance .
we are also introducing improved proposal for more efficiency and transparency .
eu law must be implemented before eu money is made available .
this applies to public procurement and to price regulation .
i am keen to see how this is handled in the vote .
strategic reporting is also an evaluation of the ongoing process .
the report focus on city and their role in cohesion policy .
i would like to raise several point in my introduction .
thirdly , i would like to mention the theme of partnership .
much ha already been said on the topic of jessica .
in the real world , however , not much is happening .
today , 196 million european citizen are living in border region .
europe is divided into 27 member state and 271 region .
the change to the categorisation during the next period will highlight this fact .
firstly , i want to look at mr pieper 's report .
nevertheless , i understand the concern and misgiving which some people have expressed .
i would also like to thank mr sanchez-schmid for her contribution .
we have already discussed territorial cooperation on several occasion .
it should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty .
transport will become an even more important part of citizen ' life .
without flexible transport option , the town and city will die .
approximately 73 % of europe 's total population life in urban area .
they will not be funded at the expense of other region .
on the contrary , the result will not be a patchwork of subsidy .
it is the instrument which hold the eu together at it heart .
it is ridiculous to believe that saving can be made in this area .
( de ) i have to disagree with this question .
mr pieper 's report in particular strengthens their position .
this is especially important for u at this point .
it will be revealing to see whether the commissioner listened to those concern .
in these case , the structural fund can not have the desired effect .
anyone who receives regional subsidy must also adhere to the rule .
thirdly , we need greater efficiency in the use of structural money .
in realistic term , it would blow the budget .
turkey ha been receiving billion of euro of structural money for year .
we need to take a critical look at this approach .
cohesion policy is a key policy for the eu .
i am counting on the intelligence and efficiency of my fellow member .
it is good that we should be having this debate together here now .
we regret that this doe not appear in the pieper report .
then we take a look at these new challenge .
in truth , there is one lingering point in the debate .
we do not yet know which region are involved .
we do not know where it will be paid out .
we do not know what the cofinancing percentage are .
these are all thing that could still substantially influence this outcome .
the approach of using transitional mechanism and instrument is not up for debate .
our cohesion and consolidation policy must cover all european region .
by region , i also mean the people that live in these region .
we need people in the european region to have a feeling of ownership .
we are now in a phase where we are discussing intermediate region .
cohesion policy lie at the heart of european policy .
it is , therefore , threatened with the loss of support .
there are 35 european region which are in a similar situation .
it track record in the last 30 year ha been excellent .
firstly , no reduction in budgetary commitment for cohesion policy .
the creation of intermediate region is essential for that .
i expect ex ante conditionality to be fully integrated into the programming process .
i would like to focus these few comment on three issue .
i shall focus on transparency , on which i drafted a report .
we can not have a two- or three-speed cohesion policy .
the information required therefore need to be diffused and used .
furthermore , it is a pro-investment policy and a pro-development policy .
this is a policy which enables structural reform and progress .
all european region should continue to have access to the structural fund .
by creating it , we will preserve this budget .
i think that no one here wish to see this budget reduced .
knowledge is the focal point and driver of any model of competition .
i hope that the council will take note of this .
their nature requires application of the eu territorial cooperation rule .
an important objective of cohesion policy is european cross-border cooperation .
the eu 's regional policy is dogged by red tape and abuse .
we need clear , simple structure for interregional project .
they should be given the necessary support in this role .
financial support must be provided , taking into account primarily regional gdp .
fellow member , smes are key to boosting economic competitiveness .
this is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely .
the 23 language of the eu are what make u rich and diverse .
i would like to begin with something very important to me .
however , simplification can not simply mean that control are just relaxed .
we must use suitable mean to try to simplify our business .
a we know there are several player and participant in this sector .
conditionality will help u to improve the quality of our work .
they are here to meet with member of the european parliament .
once more , welcome to brussels and to our parliament .
we now continue with the debate on the report on cohesion policy .
it is clear to me that such a radical change is impossible .
citizen perceive europe a an enemy who regulates and imposes drastic austerity .
this wa true 60 year ago and it is still true today .
we shall not be making concession on those position .
( the sitting wa suspended at 11.45 and resumed at 11.50 )
at the same time , regulation need to be improved .
i will miss all the friend i have made here tremendously .
let me hear again how we say 'in favour ' .
we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your country and with you .
i am sure we wish good luck to our new colleague also .
can we have a ruling one way or the other please ?
i would ask those displaying them to now take them down .
freedom of expression in the netherlands ha been guaranteed .
this ha nothing to do with our work here .
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : general motor belgium (
request for waiver of parliamentary immunity of mr adrian severin (
fishing opportunity and financial contribution provided for by the eu-seychelles fishery partnership agreement (
european urban agenda and it future in cohesion policy (

in particular , the hungarian and belgian presidency did some really excellent work .
i would like to thank you warmly for this .
you have a clear majority for the line you are taking here .
we have an enormous number of vote to get through .
it is true that it is easier to win than to lose .
such a show of unity is generally always very moving .
tractor placed on the market under the flexibility scheme (
if you had been listening you would have heard that it fell .
the word 'must not ' should be replaced by 'should not ' .
i believe that this wa the most important thing for now .
( de ) madam president , mr weber 's motion make good sense .
we have completed a truly enormous programme with some major , significant report .
we now no longer have any legislative report to vote on .
it would be best to postpone the non-legislative report to the july part-session .
the problem is therefore mainly in the eu member state .
there are expectation regarding a reduction of the bureaucracy involved in cohesion policy .
it is something which is essential for the entire union .
we have reached the limit of trying to move market with public money .
i believe that it is extremely important that we should have different fund .
naturally , these fund should have different objective and targeted approach .
however , reviewing the rule regulating the fund themselves is equally important .
but i have to stand back and question the premise .
moreover , it contains wise precept for the political management of spain .
of course , this can not be achieved with a democratic decision .
let me come back to the image of the football match .
that is why we need a clear decision-making process .
what do we do when someone break the rule ?
you can see the flaw in the logic there , my friend .
european integration ha failed , so let u have more of it !
monetary union is not enough , we need more economic union .
they will offer consumer a broader choice a well a lower price .
unfortunately , this wa not my week with the catch-the-eye procedure .
in germany we have a particularly large number of small and medium-sized business .
this ha been the practice for hundred of year .
however , that should not happen at the expense of the progress programme .
it must be done in the way that mr des ha described .
for this reason , budgetary effort must also be maintained .
'appropriate ' applies just a much to the farmer a to the taxpayer .
taken in this context , capping direct payment is a counterproductive measure .
it is not our job to destroy competitive structure .
without that , all the rest of it is just talk .
we want to know when , and what will replace them ?
unfortunately , the number of worker migrating ha been highest in rural area .
the second comment concern a signal to the competent european authority .
i wish governor draghi every success in his work .
for all these reason i am proud to give him my full support .
i listened to his hearing at the european parliament on 14 june .
he face some significant challenge , given the current situation .
the committee subsequently recommended the appointment of mr draghi .
we offer him our best wish in his work .
the right candidate would have been germany 's axel weber .
this is the third time that the egf ha been mobilised in 2011 .
this is good news for the thousand of family concerned .
this is the third application to be examined under the 2011 eu budget .
however , the little which is being given may relieve their hardship .
it endorses the relocation implemented by u firm general motor .
it sanction the appetite for profit of multinationals and their billionaire boss .
i am not against mobilisation of financial assistance for redundant belgian worker .
it is for that reason that i voted in favour of the report .
parliament ha taken a favourable view of the matter today .
opel antwerp wa a modern and successful car assembly business .
yet gm very arrogantly decided to scrap 2 834 job .
all of this leaf a particularly bad taste in the mouth .
the egf should be used equitably by all member state .
i vote in favour of mr casini 's report .
a more balanced report will then be submitted to plenary .
the proposal is based on the principle of equality and cooperation .
i vote in favour of the request for waiver of immunity .
despite this , he himself claim that all of the charge are fabricated .
i agree with such option recommended by the committee on legal affair .
for these reason , i voted in favour of this report .
they do not exhaust resource and they support local development .
it is agreement of this kind that guarantee these principle .
this is a goal and a concern that we naturally share .
these are issue that it is important to clarify in the future .
seychelles ' economy relies essentially on tourism and fishery .
these vessel are creating many new job for seychelles seaman .
they should also serve to promote the sustainable exploitation of maritime resource .
the agreement will allow fishing for 28 tuna seiners and 12 surface long-liners .
i voted in favour of the report presented by mr capoulas santos .
moreover , there are often no check on compliance .
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
eur 682 500 will be paid annually a a financial contribution .
the custom union concluded in 1990 increased these already strong and natural tie .
the eu-andorra agreement ha been in place since 1990 .
the eu-andorra agreement ha been in place since 1990 .
i therefore think it is right for parliament to approve this agreement .
we have therefore voted for parliament 's approval of the proposal .
we need to create the appropriate condition for this .
the agreement wa the basis for the custom union between both party .
the agreement wa the basis for the custom union between both party .
canada is a leading world producer of aircraft and aviation equipment .
the agreement allows the certification system to be harmonised .
in view of the above , i agree to the agreement being concluded .
above all it will make the market safer and more competitive .
for the future , there is potential for unlimited mutual recognition .
this will lower cost for company in this sector .
all this will make aviation market more competitive and more secure .
only six member state currently have bilateral agreement with canada covering product certification .
additional effort are needed to avoid excessive delay and to improve implementation performance .
i would also stress the need for more synergy with other policy instrument .
the aim is to reduce the disparity across europe 's region .
the disparity between european region have evolved over long period of time .
clearly , european region still face striking economic , social and environmental disparity .
i , therefore , voted in favour of this document .
this increase the disparity between these country rather than reducing it .
a a result , we were able to support the report .
this strategic reporting exercise represents a new feature of cohesion policy .
this policy doe not offer immediate result : it is a long-term mechanism .
city and their entire infrastructure are built by people .
these people should be at the centre of any urban policy .
however , they are the one largely being forgotten by eu policy .
these people should therefore be at the heart of any urban policy .
however , they are the one largely being forgotten by eu policy .
european regional policy and cohesion policy deal with precisely this issue .
however , the urban dimension ha up until now received insufficient recognition .
the europe 2020 strategy , however , mainly concern future trend .
the eu 's regional and cohesion policy must address these challenge .
europe is characterised by great territorial diversity and polycentric development .
for this reason i welcomed and voted in favour of this measure .
the european urban agenda focus on developing infrastructure and service in city .
smart city require a smart communication , transport and energy infrastructure .
it is very important to balance eu priority and local need .
lithuania ha one of the highest urban suicide rate in the world .
the objective of territorial cooperation is essential to putting cohesion policy into practice .
in these area , border , barrier and obstacle are le 'real ' .
that is why the euregio and saarlorlux region need to be strengthened .
this may also speed up important project in border area .
the success of territorial cooperation is now well established .
european cross-border cooperation is currently part of cohesion policy .
consequently , funding for it implementation should be increased .
there is also a need to simplify rule on auditing and control .
this is one of the european union 's main priority .
for these reason , i am voting in favour of the report .
i voted in favour of the report presented by mr sanchez-schmid .
this is why i voted in favour of this report .
i had to vote in favour of this report .
i believe that the adopted report make an effective contribution to these objective .
indeed , improving infrastructure doe not always go hand-in-hand with major development .
cohesion policy is one of the pillar of eu economic policy .
however , coordination between cohesion policy instrument and others should be increased .
a variety of fund come into play , here .
only effective synergy between them will bring about a reduction in unemployment .
it is very important to stress the importance of this regulation .
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
i believe that this is a good instrument for avoiding macroeconomic imbalance .
in writing . - the response that europe need is a stability pact .
we need to have corrective mechanism implemented at the right time .
to ensure this package support economic growth , investment spending must be protected .
cutting such spending in time of recession would also worsen an economic downturn .
the commission will even make the decision when it come to imposing sanction .
i am voting against this democratic aberration , which i condemn .
that is why the euro area should be dissolved a quickly a possible .
i abstained from the vote to highlight this aspect and acknowledge it value .
mr ferreira 's report is concerned with preventing severe macroeconomic imbalance .
in writing . - ( e ) i voted in favour .
the report deal with the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure .
for the above reason , i voted for this report .
i therefore can not vote in favour of this report .
in this way , an authoritarian federalism is established .
i will never accept my country paying any fine to anyone .
it represents clear contempt for the principle of subsidiarity .
i am unable to support this motion for the reason stated .
the implementation of the measure is essential for the euro area .
i am pleased that the rapporteur underline this fact .
most importantly , we need transparency , accountability and independent surveillance .
this is an essential part of increasing economic governance .
the report deal with requirement for the budgetary framework of the member state .
i would stress the need for mean of independent oversight to be established .
it is not enough to control the public deficit .
there is also a need to avoid public and private debt .
the member state will be prevented from taking on excessive deficit .
there is also a silent majority in europe that agrees with me .
intervention in the budget of the member state should be rejected .
however , this pact ha failed to work so far .
for this reason , i have not voted in favour of this report .
i hope that this will result in the directive being implemented more quickly .
the report deal with budgetary surveillance in the euro area .
it ha not managed to control the public deficit .
there is also a need to avoid public and private debt .
i will never allow the commission to attack france .
in writing . - ( e ) i voted against .
for that reason i voted against some of the amendment .
for the above reason , i voted for this report .
of course , this can not be a goal in itself .
a we know and have said , the result is the opposite .
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
this is a necessary precondition of a credible and transparent surveillance framework .
these instrument will put the european people at the mercy of rating agency .
i am voting against this report , which i condemn .
however , a rescheduling of debt will be unavoidable .
it would mean that poverty in the eu would only increase .
i therefore voted against the wortmann-kool , feio and goulard report .
i also voted in favour of the ferreira , haglund and ford report .
i voted in favour of the report presented by mr wortmann-kool .
budgetary planning must be founded on a realistic scenario .
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
these enforcement measure apply to member state whose currency is the euro .
in writing . - i abstained from this vote .
this is tantamount to the hangman 's salary being paid by the victim !
because this should be roundly rejected , i voted against this report .
all of these austerity measure hit wage-earners and the weakest sector of society .
in writing . - ( e ) i have abstained .
a there are no report providing justification , i am therefore abstaining .
macroeconomic surveillance can not be based on a static and simplistic reference framework .
institutionalised austerity can not be the only response that we offer european .
for this reason , ensuring prudent fiscal policy-making is key .
i did not support the package a a whole .
parliament is mistaken in calling for automatic , more severe sanction .
of course we need budgetary discipline and le debt .
however , economic policy is not just a simple mechanical sequence of procedure .
this is about improving and harmonising consumer protection at european level .
this could be done by email or telephone within a two-week period .
a balance must be struck between strengthening consumer right and cutting red tape .
in writing . - ( fr ) e-commerce is undeniably successful .
it is evidently a lasting trend and will remain so .
the european parliament is restoring overall coherence with this vote .
last but not least , meps have voted for genuine price transparency .
my final vote on the directive is one of abstention .
i have therefore voted in favour of the proposal for a directive .
however , unfortunately , that approach is still unfeasible at this stage ...
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
this text provides for new , very important regulation for e-commerce .
it is a positive proposal , overall , and we voted in favour .
of the new right , the following are particularly important :
until now , this situation ha severely damaged the single european market .
in this way , their concern have been heard .
it should be noted that the european consumer ' organisation welcome this proposal .
however , in my view we must not rest on our laurel .
however , sadly , some provision miss the point .
we are thus working towards achieving a true internal market .
it is good that we periodically review and modify provision in these area .
the above essential matter and principle have found expression in the schwab report .
we must aim in the future to protect consumer against unfair contractual term .
this protection should be standardised on a eu-wide basis .
however , harmonisation is not something to be achieved by force .
only by achieving this objective can the internal market function effectively .
in addition , they will be protected from unfair activity .
this requires an adjustment of the scope of application .
in writing . - a directive harmonising consumer right across europe make sense .
differing consumer law in member state have deterred company from expanding their market .
it is difficult to reconcile 27 different legal tradition on these subject .
this is what make the directive adopted today important .
all delivery must be made within a period of 30 day .
this will give greater peace of mind to online shopper .
`` the green welcome the greater protection for consumer buying digital content .
the responsibility for this situation lie not with parliament but with the commission .
the internal market remains one of the pillar and driver of european integration .
therefore , a legal solution at union level is essential .
that is a clear improvement on the current 7-day period .
i believe this new directive will increase transaction within europe .
however , improving consumer right should not be restricted to the internet .
we must reduce bureaucracy and promote transparency in all area of consumer right .
cross border selling will become easier , helping both consumer and trader alike .
it establishes a gradual , phased reduction in polluting emission .
environmental protection is one of the european union 's priority .
the directive proposed by the commission should be warmly welcomed .
it take account of environmental objective approved by the eu some time ago .
in writing . - ( lt ) i welcome this resolution .
this directive deal with exhaust emission from diesel engine installed in tractor .
it respect the environmental protection objective adopted some time ago by the eu .
it is essential to impose a ban on exporting waste .
non-recyclable nuclear waste must not be exported to third country .
the future lie in a mix of energy supply .
i therefore voted for the directive on managing this waste .
i voted in favour of the report on the management of radioactive waste .
the strengthening of nuclear safety and security regulation wa essential for several reason .
of course one reason is the serious nuclear accident in japan .
it is therefore our responsibility to demand maximum safety .
third country are not the 'dustbins ' of the eu member state .
the mostly outdated construction method used have led to poor safety standard .
neighbouring country like austria are often not even informed when an incident occurs .
therefore , nuclear safety assessment , research and check must be continuous .
we must continuously exchange good practice in this area throughout the eu .
we must not allow people 's health or the environment to be endangered .
for this reason i can not support this report .
that is the first lesson to be learnt from today 's vote .
i hope that the council will take due account of our position .
this position wa supported by a majority and i am glad of this .
member state are ultimately responsible for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management .
how and to what extent should iter be financed ?
not one euro more should be added to iter .
i therefore voted for the amendment against increasing expenditure for iter .
unfortunately , however , they were not adopted for want of a majority .
we have therefore chosen to vote against the proposal that called for this .
the union must inevitably pay what it ha promised to pay .
unfortunately , it wa not possible to vote on these aspect separately .
i fully agree with the priority outlined by the rapporteur , mr balzani .
2012 is the penultimate year in the current financial period .
it is an important year from a financial perspective for eu programme .
at time of crisis , investment is needed in job and development .
investment account for 95 % of the european union budget .
i can not see why anyone should object to this increase .
this money need to be found from the already cash-strapped national budget .
however , there is plenty of scope available for saving .
it is for these reason that i have voted against this draft budget .
some cutback are necessary and therefore some priority can also take second place .
for the reason listed above , i chose to abstain during the vote .
we are not of course advocating spending for spending 's sake .
we are well aware of the terrible crisis ravaging our continent .
for that reason , i welcome the work done by the rapporteur .
such service must therefore be provided on a voluntary basis .
one example of this is the conversion of manure into energy .
the meps have established the major thrust of their priority .
the ceiling on direct payment would mean disaster not only for czech farmer .
this very comprehensive report take account of all the various interest involved .
i think that continuous monitoring of the le obvious issue is also positive .
i believe that the adopted report offer this possibility .
i am hoping for more equality a regard the first pillar .
i think it is essential to keep the current milk quota system .
( abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rule of procedure )
progress and technological innovation will play a key role in the new cap .
more particularly , maintaining the cap budget after 2013 wa an essential point .
agricultural fund are service-related payment that enable reliable planning for farming family .
it is essential that we should adhere to the established 'two-pillar model ' .
the second pillar is a strong element for sustainable agriculture .
a ceiling for direct payment is also open to debate .
agricultural policy must remain a key element of european policy .
the cap is a policy of and for everyone .
i welcome this vote , which is an achievement for the european parliament .
i support the report because it includes the gender dimension of the cap .
i would also like to see farmer rewarded for their work on biodiversity .
most farmer are sensitive to this issue and choose environmentally friendly production method .
it also advocate a safety net and promotes the association of small farmer .
smaller agribusiness often incur heavy cost when complying with health and environmental rule .
flexibility is important because the situation varies in the different member state .
we believe that these will institutionalise inefficiency in the farming sector .
in general , the deß report is more positive than the commission proposal .
disparity in the provision of aid and assistance for farmer must be eliminated .
direct payment are a legitimate source of income for europe 's farmer .
in order to achieve this a ceiling should be set .
it also advocate a safety net and promotes the association of small farmer .
change is always difficult but the agriculture sector must adapt to market reality .
for instance , tourism and recreation can be important driver of rural economy .
in writing . - ( fr ) in favour .
the risk of a wide gap is quite real .
they can not compete with europe 's underpriced export .
the budget earmarked for eu agriculture should therefore remain unaltered .
lithuania can not allow itself to neglect the agricultural sector .
we must continue to support our farmer ' effort to modernise their farm .
i would like to say that i voted against the des report .
for these reason i could not vote for adoption of the des report .
sadly , dubious instrument are sometimes used to this end .
